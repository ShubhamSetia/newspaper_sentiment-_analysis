"Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina failed ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the NCA","The acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. (Source: File) The acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. (Source: File)

The failure to clear the ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy was the primary reason why Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were not considered for the Sri Lanka limited overs series.

The Indian team regularly undergoes a series of fitness tests with ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test being the most important of them. It is an advanced version of the ‘beep’ test that was used by teams of earlier generations. The current Indian team is considered to be the fittest by a fair distance.

It has been learnt that for the current Indian team, the acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. Captain Virat Kohli, easily the fittest Indian cricketer, scores around 21 in the test.

However, both Yuvraj and Raina have scored well below the permissible level of 19.5 with Yuvraj barely managing to touch 16, which was the biggest reason for his ouster.

“The current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable.

“On an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,” a BCCI official, who cannot come on record, told PTI today.

“In an earlier era, when the traditional beep test was in vogue, the Indian players of the 1990’s would have scored around 16 to 16.5 barring a few like Mohammed Azharuddin, Robin Singh or Ajay Jadeja.

“But now it’s different as the skipper himself is hitting the benchmark, which the Australian cricket team sets it,” the official added. Just for understanding, how the Yo-Yo Test works.

Cones are placed to mark out two lines 20 meters apart. A player starts with his foot behind one of the lines, and begins running when instructed. The player continues running between the two lines, turning when signalled by the recorded beeps.

After each minute or so, the pace gets quicker. If the line is not reached in time, the player must run to the line turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test is stopped if the player fails to catch up with the pace within the two ends.

The entire process is software-based where the results are recorded. It must be noted that the same test for football and hockey team will produce entirely different results have higher benchmarks, considering the speed and endurance level involved with the sport.

Day before I-Day: Punjab govt issues fresh guidelines for schools as per MHRD order,"Earlier, the education department of Punjab has issued letter to the government schools dated August 10 which say that each school has to unfurl tricolor in the campus.

However there was no mention of ‘Sankalp programme’ or oath taking ceremony as mentioned by MHRD

A week after the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) issued guidelines for schools to celebrate Independence Day, the Punjab education department issued fresh guidelines for government schools in line with MHRD orders on Monday.

In its orders dated August 7, MHRD said that schools have to organize ‘Sankalp programme’ near ‘Shaheed Smaraks’ and an oath has to be undertaken vowing removal of corruption, poverty, terrorism, casteism and communalism by 2022 to form a ‘New India’.

Earlier, the education department of Punjab has issued letter to the government schools dated August 10 which say that each school has to unfurl tricolor in the campus. It added that ‘singing national anthem has to be the mandatory and important part of the entire celebrations’.

However there was no mention of ‘Sankalp programme’ or oath taking ceremony as mentioned by MHRD. The fresh orders issued just a day before I-Day (copy with The Indian Express) by the office of Director General of School Education (DGSE) say that schools have to organize Sankalp programme and an oath taking ceremony.

The letter reads, ‘Celebrating 70 years of India’s independence organizing additional activities beside regular programmes. Students should be taken to nearby martrydom memorials and should be told about our freedom fighters. If not taken to memorials, they should be told about freedom fighters on the school campus itself. Then they should be administered an oath vowing removal of corruption, communalism, casteism, poverty and terrorism from the country in next five years.’

A quiz competition for class 11 and 12 has to be organized on the topic ‘Independence Struggle and India’s Development’. The letter further says that students can refer to ‘PM Narendra Modi mobile app’ to download quiz questions.

For class 6 to 10, painting competition on the theme of ‘Independence Movement’ has to be organized by August 30 and the best paintings to be displayed on notice board.

Krishan Kumar, secretary education Punjab said, “We did not receive the letter of MHRD till August 10 when we issued our letter. We never had any objection over MHRD orders. So now we have issued separate instructions as per that letter. However, in our general instructions dated August 10, it is only unfurling of tricolor and singing national anthem which was mandatory.”

The school heads however said that they have not received any orders apart from the letter received on August 10 and issuing such detailed instructions a day before I-Day is a cruel joke by the government.

“We have only received the letter dated August 10 and no instructions on I-Day have come after that yet. Issuing such instructions hours before the I-Day is a sort of cruel joke with the teachers who have to organize everything,” said a principal from a government school in Ludhiana.

No Fond Return of Love,"Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part.

Title: Men Without Women

Author: Haruki Murakami

Publishers: Harvill Secker/Penguin Random House

228 pages

“Loneliness seeps deep down inside your body, like a red-wine stain on a pastel carpet,” says the narrator of the titular story of Men Without Women. The men in c’s heart-rending new book of short stories are all stained — be it by loneliness, their deficiencies or the phantom pain from a wonderfully innocent first love. These indelible marks act as a common strand as the author plays through all seven stories, hitting blue notes aplenty along the way.

In the ever-changing world of Murakami’s writing, there are a few assurances — most characters will have musical tastes ranging from Schubert to The Beatles, solace is often found in bars and good food, cats are a shining ray of hope in a universe that rations it out grudgingly. The most important assurance, however, is that happiness and meaning will be hard to find and even harder to keep.

For many characters, the search that ensues is the driving force that pushes their fractured selves forward. Such a quest — be it literal as in The Wind Up Bird Chronicles (1997), or metaphorical, as with Kafka on the Shore (2005) — is often the only hint of proactivity in an otherwise bland, almost dispassionate, array of protagonists. The latest collection begins with Drive My Car — a reference to The Beatles and the story of Kafuku, a middle-aged actor and widower, whose wife had affairs throughout the span of their marriage. Tortured by the knowledge of the affairs, what Kafuku seeks more than anything else is to know why. Such a curiousity is, in Murakami’s world, a powerful, arbitrary force devoid of a place on any moral scale.

Perhaps, one of the biggest triumphs of the book is the ease with which Murakami indulges in tragicomedy, maneuvering between the two genres effortlessly. In The Independent Organ, the protagonist speaks of successful cosmetic surgeon Dr Tokai. A 52-year-old confirmed bachelor, Tokai is content to remain “the casual number-two lover, a convenient rainy-day boyfriend, a handy partner for a casual fling”. That is, until, he falls in love with a young, married woman, who eventually ends their affair, leaving the doctor to grapple desperately with a suffocating sense of loss for the very first time. The narrator mocks and empathises with Tokai in equal measure — this narrative tone prevaricates between dark and light in stories such as Kino or Yesterday as well.

While a Murakami short story can be seen as a condensed version of his much lengthier novels, earlier collections such as The Elephant Vanishes (1993) seem to wrestle with challenges in form, struggling not to sacrifice pace for form or flair for substance. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. This is not to suggest a dearth of experiments, however. Two particularly intriguing tales — Scheherazade and Samsa in Love — are also among the more fantastical and dream-like. The former falls into the category of works such as Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (1985), in that key plot elements can be seen as representative of the narrative structure.

The story that best puts the “magical” in magical realism is Samsa in Love, a play on Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis (1915). Thrust into an “ill-formed, fragile, ludicrous” human body, an insect must come to terms with his new physical and metaphysical realities. The narration is languid and almost directionless at points, as it explores Samsa being thrust into the world of human interactions with the arrival of a hunchbacked female locksmith at the house he is in, with little idea of even the concept of lust or romantic interest.

When it comes to a central component in Murakami’s exploration of loneliness and curiosity, which are, by nature, deeply intertwined with notions of love and lust, a level of indulgence on the part of readers is undoubtedly necessary. Within the Americanophilic, dream-like worlds that the author builds, there is a thin line between the confidently-paced and “get to the point already!” This line tends to be a divisive one, placing most readers firmly in one camp or the other.

Those who find the indulgence to stroll along this narrative path, however, will likely find themselves in a space one character refers to as the “unrealness of reality”. Left adrift here, in the beguiling space where the author thrives, readers will have to find their own way out. A few, if they’re lucky enough, might chance across a cat or two along the way.

On Lakshya’s remarkable achievement, his coach Vimal Kumar said, “It is a creditable achievement for Lakshya. He is still a junior but he has been able to win tournaments and that is a good sign. We had sent five players on a 10-day training trip with the French national team. He trained under the great Peter Gade and it has benefitted him.”

He added, “He had a good tournament. He beat the top seed Sam Parsons in the first round. He won the junior National and also was finalist at Senior Nationals this year and it gave him a lot of confidence to beat top players like HS Prannoy. So I feel if groomed properly, he does have a great future.”

In two months time, he will be playing Vietnam Grand Prix and then it would be a junior World championship.”

In 2016, Lakshya had clinched the India International Series and also a bronze at the CPB Badminton and Sports Science Training Center in Thailand.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in says North Korean nuclear-tipped ICBM is a “red line”,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in. (Source: Reuters Photo) South Korean President Moon Jae-in. (Source: Reuters Photo)

North Korea would be “crossing a red line” if it put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile, South Korea’s president said on Thursday, but the United States had promised to seek Seoul’s approval before taking any military action. North Korea’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fuelled a surge in tensions in recent days. Pyongyang has threatened to fire missiles towards the Pacific island of Guam and U.S. President Donald Trump has warned it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States.

“I would consider that North Korea is crossing a red line if it launches an intercontinental ballistic missile again and weaponises it by putting a nuclear warhead on top of the missile,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at a news conference marking his first 100 days in office. Moon has repeatedly urged North Korea not to “cross the red line” but had not previously elaborated what that would constitute. Trump had promised to seek negotiations and approval from South Korea before taking any options regarding North Korea, Moon also said. The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

Washington has warned it is ready to use force if needed to stop North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes but that it prefers global diplomatic action.

“NO MILITARY SOLUTION”

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in Chile on Wednesday that “all options” remained on the table with regards to North Korea, and he called on Latin American nations to break ties with Pyongyang.

However, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said there was “no military solution” to North Korea’s nuclear threats because of Pyongyang’s massed artillery targeting the South Korean capital.

“Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us,” Bannon told The American Prospect.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has repeatedly urged Pyongyang to halt its weapons programme and at the same time urged South Korea and the United States to stop military drills in order to lower tensions.

Bannon said he was pushing the U.S. administration to take a harder line on China trade and not put complaints against its trade practices in the backseat in the hope that Beijing would help restrain leader Kim Jong Un.

“To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,” The American Prospect quoted Bannon as saying. North Korean media reported on Tuesday that Kim had delayed the decision on firing four missiles towards Guam, a U.S. territory home to a vital air base and Navy facility, while he waited to see what the United States did next.

“Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!”

"11-year-old kidnapped, strangled in Narela, police arrest uncle","The reason why the family claimed Lalit’s involvement was due to his estranged relationship with his wife, grand daughter of the complainant.

(Representational image) The reason why the family claimed Lalit’s involvement was due to his estranged relationship with his wife, grand daughter of the complainant.(Representational image)

An 11-year-old boy was allegedly abducted and strangled by his brother-in-law on Sunday. The accused had allegedly lured the boy on pretext of buying him a kite, and later took him to a forest area in Narela, where he strangled him with a piece of cloth, police said.

The accused has been identified as Lalit (27), a resident of Bhajanpura in northeast Delhi. He had been arrested within five hours of the incident being reported to police, after they managed to get their hands on a CCTV footage showing Lalit leaving on his bike with the boy.

The police questioned him after the grandfather of the boy, who is also the complainant in the case, reported to the Bhajanpura police station that the boy was missing.

“The complainant had stated that his grandson had left his house located for a Matki Phodo programme, and had subsequently disappeared. The family tried to search the locality and when they could not find him, they alleged that Lalit had kidnapped him,” said a police officer privy to the investigation.

The reason why the family claimed Lalit’s involvement was due to his estranged relationship with his wife, grand daughter of the complainant.

The father of Lalit’s estranged wife, lived with his five daughters and a son in Bhajanpura, the complaint states.

“One of his daughters fell in love with Lalit. We had protested against the marriage, but they married anyway. They started having some trouble and we convinced her to leave the man. He would beat my grand daughter, and abuse her and our family,” the complainant alleged.

During questioning, Lalit confessed to his involvement in the murder of the boy, police said. He told the police that he grew bitter over his wife’s decision to part ways with him and decided to murder the boy to exact revenge.

Lalit told police that he had conducted a recee of the forest area in Alipur and Narela, police said. The body of the boy was found with his hands and feet bound with tape. It has been sent for post-mortem after which it will be handed over to the family.

Donald Trump directs USTR to examine China’s trade policies,"US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo)

US President Donald Trump on Monday asked his country’s top trade official to investigate Chinese trade practices with the focus on intellectual property (IP) and advanced technology, asserting that “unfair” practices by foreign countries harm American businesses. “The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,” Trump said.

“Today, I’m directing the United States Trade Representative to examine China’s policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of American technology and the theft of American intellectual property,” Trump said as he signed a memorandum in this regard.

“As President of the United States, it’s my duty and responsibility to protect the American workers, technology, and industry from unfair and abusive actions,” he said.

Trump said his administration will stand up to any country that unlawfully forces American companies to transfer their valuable technology as a condition of market access.

He said the US will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs and enforce the rules of fair and reciprocal trade that form the foundation of responsible commerce.

“We will protect forgotten Americans who have been left behind by a global trade system that has failed to look — and I mean look — out for their interests. They have not been looking out at all,” he said.

Trump said the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, is empowered to consider all available options at his disposal.

“We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that is so vital to our security and to our prosperity. We will uphold our values, we will defend our workers, and we will protect the innovations, creations, and inventions that power our magnificent country,” he said.

Lighthizer said the US has for many years been facing a very serious problem. “China industrial policies and other practices reportedly have forced the transfer of vital US technology to Chinese companies,” he alleged.

“We will engage in a thorough investigation and, if needed, take action to preserve the future of US industry. Thousands of jobs are at stake for our workers and for future generations. This will be one of USTR’s highest priorities, and we will report back to the President as soon as possible,” Lighthizer said.

Top American lawmakers welcomed the move. “I am pleased that President Trump has targeted China’s forced technology policies. These practices have unfairly forced American companies to surrender vital intellectual property to their Chinese competitors as the price for doing business,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.

House Ways and Means Committee Trade Subcommittee Chairman Dave Reichert welcomed Trump in addressing China’s forced technology transfer requirements.

“The US economy and so many jobs depend on the strength of our technology companies, including some of our nation’s leading tech companies headquartered in my home state of Washington,” he said.

Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi alleged that for years now, China’s brazenly unfair trade practices have weakened America’s economy and hurt American workers.

Even though President Trump has signed a memo of instruction to the USTR to consider investigating China’s unfair intellectual property practices, Pelosi asked the agency to take a series of strong steps including requiring American companies to transfer technology and proprietary information to do business in China.

Pelosi asked USTR to take steps against China’s theft of American trade-secrets; China’s piracy of other American intellectual property, including software; and market barriers facing US businesses and products in China.

“In addition, the Administration must recognise that challenging China’s open intellectual property theft is especially vital now, in light of China’s ‘Made in China 2025’ policy. This policy will not only not only hurt American companies in China, but will make it harder for us to compete globally with Chinese firms,” Pelosi said.

“When the rules of the road are followed, US businesses and workers can compete with anyone in the world. I look forward to working with the administration as it begins this 301 investigation, and will continue to work to hold foreign countries accountable when they violate our trade laws,” said Senator Robert Portman.

The bipartisan IP Commission welcomed the decision. “The scale of Chinese forced transfer and theft of American intellectual property threatens these interests, both our prosperity and security, and thus US policy must address this set of issues,” said Dr Richard Ellings, director of the IP Commission and president of National Bureau of Asian Research.

Senator Charles Schumer, Senate Minority Leader felt that this was a weak action. “President Trump’s pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine,” he said.

"Bigg Boss Tamil: Suja Varunee is a target already, Gayathri asks Aarav to be ‘careful’","Suja Varunee enters Bigg Boss Tamil show Suja Varunee enters Bigg Boss Tamil show

Suja Varunee was the latest celebrity to enter the Bigg Boss Tamil house on Wednesday. While the showrunners made sure Suja gets a dramatic and grand entrance on the show, she was rather given the cold shoulder by most of the housemates on her arrival.

It felt like Suja’s mood was swinging between excitement and awkwardness as the actor did not get the warm welcome she expected. Bindu Madhavi was given a better welcome by the housemates. For instance, Gayathri Raghuram, who bolted towards Bindu to give her a warm hug, was nonchalant when she saw Suja in the house.

What’s more, Gayathri, who was engaged in an ego-clash with Raiza, seemingly started to form a group against Suja. Gayathri was visibly worried about Suja and she made it clear while talking to other housemates. Snehan, Vaiyapuri, Aarav and Gayathri started discussing Suja’s character based on their pre-conceived views about her.

Gayathri even asked Aarav to be careful about Suja, understandably referring to Oviya incident. For the uninitiated, the housemates were under the impression that Oviya was making romantic overtures at Aarav against his will. But, later it was revealed that they both were involved in a sort of romantic relationship as they even exchanged kisses twice on the show. And that did not end well for both of them. While Oviya quit the show, Aarav lost the respect among the viewers.

Hence, Gayathri was apparently warning Aarav not to get involved with Suja and always be ‘careful.’ Gayathri advised him to always stay close to her as she will keep him out of trouble as his big sister.

Snehan and Vaiyapuri who were present in the room seemed to agree with Gayathri’s views. Aarav responded saying he will be playing it safe.

Snehan and Vaiyapuri ridiculed Ganesh Venkatraman for being kind and thoughtful towards Suja. While other housemates were involved in backbiting, Ganesh and Bindu were helping Suja to settle in her new house.

Gayathri was telling Snehan that Suja was five times ….whatever..than Juliana. Gayathri further added that she was afraid that Suja might say something insulting to her in case if they ever get into a fight.

Most of the housemates seem to be concerned about the fact that Suja has seen all their antics, shortcomings and backbiting on the show for the last 50 days.

Injured Carlos Tevez to return to China after Argentina treatment,"Carlos Tevez asked Shanghai Shenhua to allow him to return to his native Buenos Aires for further treatment. (Source: File) Carlos Tevez asked Shanghai Shenhua to allow him to return to his native Buenos Aires for further treatment. (Source: File)

Carlos Tevez has been granted a return to his native Argentina for treatment on a calf injury, but only after agreeing in writing to return to Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua before the end of the month.

Speculation has been mounting in local media that the former Manchester United and Juventus forward was attempting to orchestrate a move back to Boca Juniors, who sold the 33-year-old to Shenhua for 11 million euros ($12.93 million) in January.

He has played just 11 times in the league for Shenhua, scoring twice, with his fitful performances blamed on the injury that first occurred in April.

Tevez asked Shenhua to allow him to return to his native Buenos Aires for further treatment. “According to the request from Carlos Tevez to our club, after discussion, we now approve his request,” Shenhua said, according to the South China Morning Post.

“He’s permitted to go back to Argentina and receive treatment at the Clinica Jorge Bombicino and he must rejoin the team on August 30 and participate in training.”

Tevez signed a two-year contract with the CSL side in January and according to media reports earns wages in the region of $800,000, making him one of the highest paid players in the world.

However, a clause in the deal that saw him move from Boca Juniors states the Argentinian club must repay more than half of the transfer fee should the striker not complete two seasons with Shenhua.

Tevez has not played in the last two games and will now miss Wednesday’s first leg of the Chinese FA Cup against second division Shanghai Shenxin and Saturday’s meeting with league leaders and defending champions Guangzhou Evergrande.

“He didn’t go back to enjoy a holiday, he went back for the rehabilitation of his muscles,” David Wang, a Spanish translator working with Shenhua, was quoted as saying by the SCMP.

“The rehabilitation process requires two weeks, but it will take two days to go and two days to come back.

“As the players are required to report to the club on August 28, Tevez won’t have enough time to do the rehabilitation, so the management of the club suggested him to leave a few days before the break and allow him to come back two days later.”

Sharad Yadav rallies support from about dozen parties,"J D(U) leader Sharad Yadav. J D(U) leader Sharad Yadav.

Out to challenge Nitish Kumar’s leadership, rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Thursday rallied about a dozen parties at an event in New Delhi and asserted that if people stand together, then even “Hitler cannot win”. Yadav organised the convention, titled ‘Sanjhi Virasat Bachao’ (save the common culture), amidst his strong opposition to Kumar joining the BJP-led NDA and his claim to represent the real JD(U). The convention was attended by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and leaders from other parties like CPI-M, CPI, SP, BSP, NCP, RJD, NC, JD-S and RLD.

Yadav, who has been removed by Kumar as leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, has been insisting that he is founder of the party and hence the real leader.

Addressing the gathering, Yadav attacked the ruling BJP as he raked up several issues including alleged atrocities against dalits and minorities, love jihad, suicides by farmers, deaths of children in a Gorakhpur hospital and the killing of soldiers at the border.

As the other opposition leaders called for a united fight, Yadav urged the youth and farmers in particular to make right use of their “power of vote” for a bright future. “I am confident that when people of this country, world stand united, even Hitler cannot win,” he said amid cheers from his supporters.

At the convention, he was lauded by many opposition leaders for standing with the secular forces and some of them recognised Yadav’s faction as the “real JD(U)”.

Yadav said that after Kumar decided to join hands with the BJP recently, he had received “several calls” from people who thought he may become a union minister but added that there is a tradition of “making sacrifices” to save the composite culture.

He appealed to the youth to join the “battle” for saving the composite culture. “I want the youth to come to join the battle to save the composite culture. They (BJP) talk about ‘love jihad’. What will transpire between a young boy or girl, if not love?

“I had seen the film Mughal-e-Azam years ago. It had a song ‘Mohabbat Zindabad’ (hail love). Now, here is a strange King who says you will go to jail if you fall in love,” he said, without naming anyone or a party.

Stating that Dr BR Ambedkar, despite belonging to backward community, had drafted Constitution for all the communities, Yadav said the dalits are under attack and cited examples of incidents in Gujarat’s Una and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. “Don’t target the dalit youngsters who are fighting against the injustice…the composite culture talks about embracing the deprived,” he added.

He further wondered how the country will fight against China “which is using aggressive language these days” if it is divided on communal lines. “We cannot give a reply to China, if 80 per cent of the (country’s population) youngsters, the deprived sections, farmers are not strong,” he added.

"Hope I have done enough to show that am ready, says Chris Woakes","Chris Woakes has played 17 Tests for England. (Source: Reuters) Chris Woakes has played 17 Tests for England. (Source: Reuters)

England all-rounder, Chris Woakes is keen to put his troubled phase with injuries behind him and return to action. Since his injury, Woakes has managed one first-class match. However, he is keen to make a successful return to his Edgbaston home ground where the West Indies square-off against England in a day-night Test.

Addressing the media, Woakes said,” When you’re injured there’s always someone knocking on the door ready to take your place. When you get injured that’s frustrating for you and you have to prove yourself again. I hope I have done enough to show that I’m ready, and fingers crossed I do play.

Speaking about the crown and the atmosphere, Wokes said, “Whenever you play at Edgbaston it’s always brilliant. The atmosphere will be fantastic, and it will be exciting for the players to be involved with that.”

Woakes wished Stoneman well by saying: “It is the last Test series before the Ashes, and I hope he can come in score some runs for himself and for the team. I have played a lot against Mark and I have always found him difficult to bowl to. He hits the bad ball for four – which is always frustrating for a bowler – and he’s in good form.”

Earlier, Woakes also spoke to Sky Sports and said that he was excited to be back in the scheme of things. “I’m feeling fit but whether I play or not is out of my hands but it’s great to be back in the squad and to be around the group again. I’m pleased with where I’m at but I would have liked to have got more cricket in. Because of all the T20 games, there was only one County Championship match, but I got a couple of second XI games in before that.”

Philippine police kills 32 in drugs war’s bloodiest day,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (File) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (File)

Philippine police killed 32 people in dozens of anti-drug operations in a province north of the capital, Manila, in the single deadliest day of President Rodrigo Duterte’s unrelenting war on drugs. About 109 petty criminals, including street-level drug peddlers were arrested and dozens of guns seized in police operations across Bulacan province from Monday night until Tuesday afternoon, said provincial police chief, Romeo Caramat.

“We have conducted ‘one-time, big-time’ operations in the past, so far, the number of casualties and deaths, this is the highest,” Caramat told a news conference.

He defended police action and said the deaths were during shootouts, and were not executions, as activists have often alleged. “There are some sectors that will not believe us, but, we are open for any investigation. All we can say is that we don’t have any control of the situation. As much as possible, we don’t want this bloody encounter.”

Thousands of people have been killed in the anti-drugs campaign, Duterte’s signature policy, since it was launched on June 30 last year, most users and small-time dealers from poor neighborhoods. The intensity of the crackdown has alarmed the international community, and activists and human rights groups say police have been executing suspects and planting drugs and guns at crime scenes. Police and the government officials reject that.

Police also deny involvement in thousands of murders by mysterious gunmen, blaming them on gang turf wars, drug dealers silencing informants, or vigilantes targeting drug users. “There were 32 killed in Bulacan in a massive raid, that’s good,” Duterte said in a speech. “Let’s kill another 32 every day. Maybe we can reduce what ails this country.”

Police conducted 49 sting drug operations in Bulacan that resulted in about 20 armed encounters, Caramat said. Ten other gunfights ensued when police tried to serve arrest warrants to suspects who fought back. He said 93 of those held were wanted for other crimes, as well as drugs offences. Bulacan has been a major target in the drugs war, with some 425 people killed and 4,000 offenders arrested, according to Caramat, making it the second-biggest hot spot in the crackdown outside of the Manila area.

Political opponents of Duterte have filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) accusing the president and top aides of crimes against humanity, arguing they failed to address allegations of widespread police abuses that have been brought to their attention. Duterte has welcomed the ICC complaint, and said he was willing to rot in jail to protect Filipinos.

He has often complained about human rights groups criticizing and undermining his campaign and on Wednesday said he would instead investigate them, or worse. “If they are obstructing justice, shoot them,” he said.

Donald Trump claims media ‘misrepresent’ his Charlottesville comments,"President Donald Trump (Source: AP) President Donald Trump (Source: AP)

President Donald Trump took a swing at his favorite punching bag today, claiming his comments about the deadly violence in Charlottesville were misrepresented by media. “The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!,” the US president wrote on Twitter. One protester was killed in violent clashes between neo-Nazi and so-called “Alt-Right” demonstrators and counter-protesters in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville Saturday. Both Democrat and Republican politicians criticized Trump’s initial response — when he condemned violence “on all sides” — as inadequate.

On Monday he singled out the Klu Klux and neo-Nazis as “repugnant,” but on Tuesday he returned to his original position and said there had been “blame on both sides.” Trump’s weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump’s response. The US president also took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists… and people like Ms. Heyer,” Trump said on Twitter. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd protesting the far-right march.

“Such a disgusting lie,” Trump said. “He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!” Trump appeared to be referring to his defeat of Graham in last year’s presidential primary. Graham had said the US president “took a step backward” Tuesday “by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally” and people like Heyer.

Trump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president. “Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He’s toxic!” Trump tweeted.

Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta will miss their Spanish Super Cup second leg against Real Madrid on Wednesday after suffering a thigh injury.

Barcelona said captain Iniesta would miss the match after he was not able to train with his team mates on Tuesday ahead of the encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu, where the Catalans will look to overturn a 3-1 deficit.

Iniesta, 33, was plagued by injury problems last season and rarely found top form. The midfielder joins Rafinha Alcantara and Thomas Vermaelen on the injury list at the Nou Camp. Barcelona did not give a recovery timescale for Iniesta, who may also miss the start of the league campaign on Sunday, when Barca host Real Betis

She said, “I know how it feels to be cornered, and I do not want my fans to do the same to either Julie or Shakti. As humans, we all tend to make mistakes and I am no exception. I am not perfect either, so please don’t corner them. In fact, I do not want fans who corner contestants like that.”

She also said that she enjoyed some time off, visited Varkala (Kerala) and is currently in Cochin.

She said that she understands how the patients feel when they start to lose hair, as her mother too fought cancer. She showed off her hair cut and stressed the fact that she loves it a lot and is happy to be a part of something like this.

She concluded by telling her fans to look forward to seeing her on the silver screen. Her not coming back as a contestant might break her fans’ hearts but it looks like she is dead-set on her decision. This video was posted through one of her Twitter accounts and has since gone viral.

"Gujarat Fortunegiants, Puneri Paltan win first Inter Zone fixtures: Match Highlights","Gujarat Fortunegiants are now unbeaten in three consecutive home matches. Gujarat Fortunegiants are now unbeaten in three consecutive home matches.

Gujarat Fortunegiants were nine points behind at one point. It looked like there was no way back for them. But they then shored up their defence and sharpened their attack. This is Gujarat’s third consecutive win at home. This will be a difficult pill for Bengaluru Bulls to swallow. They were cruising at one stage and still fell short by three points in the end.

Soon their first half lead swelled to nine points and Bengal Warriors could not come back from that. It is the second consecutive defeat for the Warriors. Their defence, which had looked so strong in the first two matches, leaked points in this match and that looked like the chief reason for their defeat.

Opinion | Why Is The CPM-RSS Political Rivalry In Kerala Leading To Violence?,"The CPI(M)-RSS violence in Kannur can be traced to the 1960s when workers of beedi factories struck work. With beedi workers forming the vanguard of the communist movement in the region, the factory owners called in the Jana Sangh-RSS, which had a base in neighboring Mangalore.

To know more about the story watch out the video."
How world newspapers reported India’s independence in 1947,"The major newspapers of the world had culled out a significant part of their front pages to underline the nationalist aspirations, the birth of the two nations and the celebrations as well as massacre that accompanied the same.

Mid 20th century was clearly a dramatic time for the global order. The trauma of the Second World War had its grip firmly over the psyche of the Western powers and the colonial powers were facing the wrath of the added expenses brought forth by their colonies. As the Western world reeled under its internal and external pressures, one piece of news from the oriental part of the globe had shaken it up further, enough to make its way to the front page of all the major newspapers of the world. The jewel in the crown of the British empire was lost and had found itself a space in the world map, independent of the authority of its colonial masters. Further, this long drawn battle for independence had been won at a cost, as not one but two independent nations had emerged on August 15, 1947, leaving the South Asian region soaked in blood of the Partition riots that had accompanied it.

Indian independence was a historic moment for the world. The largest and most important colony of the British empire was freed. Further, the route to freedom for India was unique in its capacity that it drew on the Gandhian theory of non-violence, something that went on to inspire several leaders across the globe. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the major newspapers of the world had culled out a significant part of their front pages to underline the nationalist aspirations, the birth of the two nations and the celebrations as well as massacre that accompanied the same. Incidentally though, while the partition of Punjab and the bloodshed resulting from it, made its way to the front pages of almost every newspaper, the partition of Bengal was barely ever mentioned at all.

Here is how some of the major newspapers of the world reported on Indian independence in 1947.

The New York Times

Flaunting a large map of the Indian subcontinent, as it stood on August 15, 1947, the front page of the American daily, New York Times reported on the celebration of freedom on one hand and the grief of partition on the other. Further, it also reported on the fact that a number of princely states were yet to decide on the nationality they wished to adhere to. The ambiguity of the status of the princely states was made evident from the map which left out states like Hyderabad and Kashmir that had not yet made up their mind.

The Washington Post

The front page of the Washington Post carried a long reportage on the celebrations following Indian independence. The paper made a keen observation of the oriental pomp accompanying the celebrations. “They began a new chapter of two independent dominions with celebrations in oriental pomp and splendor- marred by bloodshed, death and terror in wide sections of the country,” wrote the paper. The speech of Nehru, the celebratory mood in the Red Fort and the burning of Punjab were all reported under the headline “India achieves sovereignty, amid scenes of wild rejoicing.”

The Chicago Tribune

The focus of the American news daily Chicago Tribune, on the other hand, was on Lord Mountbatten taking oath as the first governor-general of India. While reporting on the increasing death toll in Punjab and the celebration of the role of Gandhi, the Chicago Tribune’s reportage referred to the newly born nations as “Hindu India” and “Muslim Pakistan”. The second page of the newspaper carried a special section dedicated to Pakistan under the headline, “Jinnah frosty as he wins his dream of Moslem state.”

The Irish Times

One of the very first British colonies to gain independence, Ireland shared a special solidarity with India in her long sought after freedom. Accordingly, the Irish daily laid its focus on the Indian accomplishment of independence. “The last stroke of midnight, booming from the dome of New Delhi’s Parliament buildings, set off the highest, noisiest and most joyful celebrations ever experienced in the East,” wrote the newspaper under the headline, “India celebrates as Britain hands over control.”

The Daily Telegraph

The celebrated British daily chalked a large portion of their front page to reportage of Indian independence. Large portions of their report were devoted to the communication between the British and Indian political elite, while a significant section was headed as “Indians praise Britain” and another as “British sagacity”. A photograph of the Union Jack at the Residency of Lucknow adorned the front page as well which said that “the Union Jack flying from the tower of the ruined Residency at Lucknow, from which it had never been lowered since recapture of the town after the siege of 1857. It was hauled down for the first and last time at midnight last night, marking the transference of power to the Dominion of India (Hindustan).”

The Times of India, the Indian Express and the Hindustan Times

Back home, the news dailies like Times of India, Hindustan Times and the Indian Express were paginated with the pride of independence. The front page of each of the papers were basking in glory of the jubilation being observed across the cities of Delhi and Bombay as Nehru delivered his ‘tryst with destiny’ speech. The birth of Pakistan too was given due importance as the paper reported on Jinnah’s communication with Britain regarding the future relationship between Pakistan and its former coloniser. Also reported were the tasks ahead for the newfound nations.

India vs Sri Lanka: Numbers reveal the great divide,"The Indian bowlers dominated the list of most economical bowlers of the series. Mohammed Shami was the most economical bowler followed by Hardik Pandya, Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav. (Source: AP) The Indian bowlers dominated the list of most economical bowlers of the series. Mohammed Shami was the most economical bowler followed by Hardik Pandya, Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav. (Source: AP)

India trounced Sri Lanka in just three days at Pallekele to register their first away Test series whitewash. However, what was noticeable was the eventual margin between the two sides: an innings and 171 runs with Sri Lanka unable to make India bat in the second innings for a second straight Test. As the series progressed and moved from Galle to Colombo and now to Kandy, the margin of defeat has only gotten bigger while the level of embarrassment for the hosts continued to rise. In the first Test, India beat Sri Lanka by 304 runs and won the second by innings and 53 runs. The gap between the two sides is visible beyond just the victory margins – even in individual performances, Virat Kohli-captained India did miles better than the hosts Sri Lanka who looked weary with the bat and the ball.

# India scored a combined 1949 runs in four innings in the series. Infact, two of the innings – in Colombo and Galle – were both shortened with India declaring after losing nine wickets and three wickets respectively. That’s an average of 487 runs per inning. Compare that to Sri Lanka who scored a collective 1421 runs in the series in six innings at an average of 236 runs.

# Individually speaking, three of the five top scoring batsmen in the series batsmen wore the India jersey. Shikhar Dhawan was the pick of the lot with 358 runs in the series followed by Cheteshwar Pujara (309) and Ajinkya Rahane (229 runs) in fourth. Dimuth Karunaratne (285 runs) and Niroshan Dickwella (227 runs) were the two batsmen who came close to giving the Indian bowlers some competition.

# Courtesy of the phenomenal batting display India became first visiting team to score more than 500 in two successive Tests (first two Tests) in Sri Lanka. This was also the second instance when a side had scored more than 600 four times in a year.

#The series also witnessed the first time in a Test match in Sri Lanka where six Indian batsmen ended up scoring more than 50 in India’s innings. The dominating batting performance by Sri Lanka also witnessed the visitor’s record leads of over 300 runs three times – once each at Galle, Colombo (SSC) and Pallekele – a feat achieved by them for the first time.

#Furthermore, amongst the list of highest averages of batsmen in the series, the Indian batsman ruled the roost and not a single Sri Lankan batsman could feature in the top five. Shikhar Dhawan recorded the highest average in the series with 89.50.

But it is not only the batting where the divide is far and wide. With the ball, Indian bowlers were miles ahead of their rivals. But it is not only the batting where the divide is far and wide. With the ball, Indian bowlers were miles ahead of their rivals.

# But it is not only the batting where the divide is far and wide. With the ball, Indian bowlers were miles ahead of their rivals. R Ashwin emerged as the highest wicket taker in the series with 17 scalps to his name with a best of 5/69. Ravindra Jadeja (13), Mohammed Shami (10) and Umesh Yadav (6) too gave evidence to Sri Lanka losing twenty wickets in each match. Nuwan Pradeep was the best bowler for Sri Lanka with six wickets – incidentally, all six of his wickets came in the same inning in Galle.

#Individual bowling achievements saw the Indian team overshadow their rivals comfortably. Ravindra Jadeja became the quickest left armer to reach 150 wickets in Tests while R Ashwin (in the second Test) scalped his 26th five-wicket haul in Test match cricket.

# Another noticeable fact was the high run rate which the Indian batsmen maintained during their innings. Throughout the series, the run rate for India remained consistently above 3.5 runs per over and sometimes even touched 5 in a session. However, when the Indian bowlers came into bowl they kept the opposition under check. This once again led to the Indian bowlers dominate the list of most economical bowlers of the series.

# Mohammed Shami was the most economical bowler (2.91) followed by Hardik Pandya (2.97), R Ashwin (3.02) and Kuldeep Yadav (3.20). Kuldeep Yadav is followed by Vishwa Fernando (3.35) who was the only Lankan bowler who managed to feature in the list of top five.

Hence, with this whitewash not only did India emphasise their supremacy over their neighbours rivals but also managed to leapfrog ahead of the 1996 World Champions leaps and bounds. Sri Lanka was outplayed and outclassed in every department and to narrow the gap will require a considerable amount of introspection and rebuilding.

"Merck, Under Armour CEOs quit Donald Trump advisory panel over rally response","US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo) US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo)

The chief executives of Merck and Under Armour chief have resigned from a White House advisory panel on manufacturing after President Donald Trump’s initial failure to explicitly condemn a white supremacist rally. “America’s leaders must honour our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all men are created equal,” Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is African American, wrote on Twitter on Monday.

“As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”

Trump didn’t wait long to respond.

“Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” the US president said.

Later in the day, Trump went back at Frazier, saying that Merck was “a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES.”

Under Armour founder and chief executive Kevin Plank’s statement was more subtle.

“Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics,” he said in a statement.

“I love our country and our company and will continue to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport, which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.”

Plank expressed support for Trump publicly earlier this year, triggering global backlash.

The CEOs announced their decision as criticism was mounting over Trump’s failure over the weekend to explicitly denounce the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members whose rally in Charlottesville, Virginia set off violent clashes.

A man drove his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters, killing a young woman and injuring 19. Two state police officers responding to the events died in a helicopter crash near the area.

Later on Monday, Trump made a statement calling out specific hate groups.

“Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” he said from the White House.

The Justice Department has launched a civil rights inquiry into the incident, and the driver, a 20-year-old Ohio man who was said to have had a history of neo-Nazi beliefs, has been charged with second-degree murder.

Frazier is a Harvard Law School-trained attorney whose experience includes pro bono work that won the release of a wrongly convicted death row inmate in Alabama.

Frazier is not the first executive to depart a Trump advisory panel.

After Trump announced he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, Disney chief executive Bob Iger and Tesla Motors head Elon Musk both left a White House advisory council, joining former Uber leader Travis Kalanick, who stepped down in February following criticism of Trump’s travel ban.

But most other executives appear to be staying put.

“Heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans,” said Pepsi chief executive Indra Nooyi, in a statement that did not address the Trump panel.

Other executives, including those from General Electric and Dow, planned to stay on Trump panels, US financial news media reported.

Akali Dal workers booked for attack on police station in Punjab,"They have been booked for attempt to murder, ransom and stopping police officials from performing their duty on Monday night.

Police have booked seven women and five men along with unidentified persons for attacking Chohla Sahib police station at Tarn Taran on the eve of Independence Day. All accused belongs to SAD (Badal).

The list of accused includes SAD sarpanch of Varayan village, Davinder Singh, his wife Manjit Kaur, Milkha Singh, Jasbir Singh , Kabul Singh, Shawinder Singh, Baldev Singh, Jasbir Kaur, Daljit Kaur, Baljit Kaur, Kulwinder Kaur, Simarjit Kaur and Ranjit Kaur.

They have been booked for attempt to murder, ransom and stopping police officials from performing their duty on Monday night. The accused allegedly came to free one Beant Singh, his wife Raminder Kaur and their son Sarabjit Singh, from police custody.

Beant, his wife and son had been booked in July 2016 for alleged murder of Bachan Singh. Bachan was the unmarried brother of Beant, and was allegedly killed to grab his land. While Raminder Kaur has been in jail since July 2016, the other accused were on the run and were arrested on

Monday.

According to FIR, Sarpanch Davinder Singh and others attacked the police station on Monday night to free the accused, but failed. They allegedly broke the windows and doors of the police station.

Meanwhile, SAD’s Tarn Taran MP, Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, alleged that police had falsely implicated SAD workers.

“All this high handedness on the part of the police is at the instance of Congress MLA and other Congress workers. The excesses and cruelty is being done by Punjab’s Captain government,” he said.

SAD workers also staged a dharna against Punjab government in front of police station Chohla Sahib on

Wednesday. “No accused has been arrested yet as SSP Darshan Singh has marked inquiry in the case registered against SAD Sarpanch and others,” said SHO Sukhraj Singh.

Watch Thor Ragnarok new trailer: Doctor Strange makes a grand entry. Is he telling Thor about Hela’s evil plans?,"Thor Ragnarok new trailer: Doctor Strange played by actor Benedict Cumberbatch takes away major limelight from Chris Hemsworth. Thor Ragnarok new trailer: Doctor Strange played by actor Benedict Cumberbatch takes away major limelight from Chris Hemsworth.

The buzz around Marvel Cinematic Universe is only increasing by the day. The studio is smartly playing its cards, way before its Avengers: Infinity War strikes next year. With its upcoming Thor: Ragranok just months away from release, its makers have unveiled the third trailer of the film. And if you saw Chris Hemsworth aka Thor’s return in the first one, the might of Hulk in the second, then the latest promo is all about actor Benedict Cumberbatch aka Doctor Strange and why he can sweep away any plot of MCU with his sheer brilliance and screen presence.

Thor: Ragranok is the third film in the Thor franchise. Until now, we know that Thor is jailed on the other side of universe, sans his Mjolnir, while his realm, the Asgard is on the verge of Ragnarok, the doom at the hands of the powerful villain Hela, played by veteran Cate Blanchett. But before Thor saves his Asgardian civilization, he has to survive the deadly gladiatorial fight against Hulk without his hammer. His fellow Avenger is surely not an ally this time, or maybe he is. The conversation between the two super heroes make us doubt whether the God of Thunder really won the fight against Bruce Banner. So where does Doctor Strange fit in all this?

The new international trailer for Thor: Ragnarok gives us a new piece of footage with an appearance by Doctor Strange. Marvel’s Japanese social media accounts posted the third trailer where we see Benedict Cumberbatch telling Thor, “I sense a great change in your future.” Is he pointing at the might of Hela which will be a challenge for Thor? This new trailer can also be connected to the post-credits of Doctor Strange which had the two heroes speaking about Asgar and its events.

The Japanese trailer of Thor: Ragnarok runs with the film’s title as ‘Thor: Battle Royale’. We still wonder what it is pointing at. However, this is surely a better suited name for this new film from the Marvel. Do you agree?

Directed by Taika Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok also features Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban and Jeff Goldblum. The much-awaited film releases on November 6.

Vivian Richards has insisted England are “beatable” as he urged the West Indies to restore a sense of pride during their Test series against Joe Root’s men. The first of a three-match contest starts at Birmingham’s Edgbaston ground on Thursday with the inaugural day/night Test in England.

West Indies have not won a Test in England since 2000, just part of a miserable overall away record during the last 20 years. They have also arrived without several star players, the legacy of a bitter dispute with administrators and a clash with the lucrative Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 tournament. England come into the series fresh from a 3-1 home Test success against South Africa.

But former West Indies captain Richards, one of the best batsmen cricket has known, said England had frequently under-performed, citing the hosts’ defeat by eventual champions Pakistan in the semi-finals of this year’s Champions Trophy one-day tournament as an example.

“Over the years, it’s always amazed me with England,” Richards told Thursday’s edition of The Times.

“They never win as much as they should,” he added at an event staged by the Lord’s Taverners cricket charity.

“I look at the Champions Trophy — there was no better team for that format but they still fell short.

“England have the right stuff in their teams but then they fall down at some hurdle or just don’t jump high enough.”

Richards, nicknamed ‘The Master Blaster’, had some of his best days as a cricketer in England, including scoring two double hundreds in a 1976 Test series where he made 829 runs in total, as well as hitting a match-winning century against England in the 1979 World Cup final at Lord’s.

Known for his intimidating presence at the crease, Richards urged Jason Holder’s side not to be overawed by England.

“I hope the West Indies team can see that England are beatable,” said Richards, who also enjoyed success in English county cricket with both Somerset and Glamorgan.

Richards, who scored 8,540 runs including 24 hundreds at an average of more than 50 in 121 Tests, was a key member of a West Indies side that dominated the world game in the 1970s and 1980s.

As such, watching their decline has been particularly painful for the 65-year-old Antiguan

“It does hurt that the glory days have been lost,” he said. “I was doing some television work during the Champions Trophy and there was no West Indies there. No West Indies. That’s like saying there would be no Chelsea or Arsenal in the Premier League. That’s how it felt.”

Richards added: “I don’t believe that many of the players of the modern day really understand the legacy of West Indies cricket and why they are playing for West Indies and why it matters so much.

“Yes, we had our differences (when I was playing) but what stood us out was when we put on that maroon cap there was a real sense of pride. I want to see that return, I want to see that in this group.”

(Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha)

With its narrow rooms, metal bars and bunk beds, Bangkok’s first prison-themed hostel promises the look and feel of a real jail in the bustling Thai capital. The Sook Station hostel in Bangkok’s Udom Suk neighbourhood offers guests pin-striped pyjamas for 700 baht ($21) and a wall with a height chart where they can have their mugshots taken.

The nine-room hostel is the first foray into the hospitality industry for Sittichai Chaivoraprug, 55, and his wife, 49-year-old Piyanat Teekavanich, after careers in the technology sector. They were inspired by a shared love of travel and the 1994 prison escape film “The Shawshank Redemption”, starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

The hostel’s design includes black-out doors and windows in two rooms to create the feeling of being in solitary confinement. Showers are located on a caged-in rooftop. For guests who may feel a sense of claustrophobia, seven rooms have a small balcony.

Thailand expects to welcome almost 35 million foreign tourists – nearly half the country’s population – in 2017. Many of them visit or transit through Bangkok, a regional travel hub. Sook Station charges between 790 to 1,630 baht ($24-$49) a night for the prison-themed experience. “People love it or hate it,” Sittichai told Reuters, adding that most bookings have come by word of mouth.

Some guests like Yui, a 42-year-old hotel worker, are repeat customers. “I feel it’s a real prison because when I arrived it was dark,” Yui said. Now on her third stay, she said the hostel’s style and friendly staff “feels like home”. ($1=33.28 baht)

Philippines: 21 alleged drug offenders killed in single day,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (Source-AP Photo/File) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (Source-AP Photo/File)

Philippine police say simultaneous anti-drug operations in a northern province have left 21 alleged drug offenders dead. Officials say it is the highest death toll in a single day since President Rodrigo Duterte launched his ‘war on drugs’ in July last year.

Senior Superintendent Romeo M Caramat Jr said today that operations in Bulacan province in the past 24 hours left 21 dead and 64 others arrested. Police say the suspects had offered armed resistance against arresting officers.

Police records show since the crackdown started, 3,264 alleged drug offenders have been killed in gunbattles with law enforcers. More than 2,000 others died in drug-related homicides, including attacks by motorcycle-riding masked gunmen.

Human rights groups report a higher toll and demand an independent investigation into Duterte’s possible role in the violence.

UN chief concerned about India’s plans to deport Rohingyas,"In Picture, United Nation Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (AP Photo) In Picture, United Nation Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (AP Photo)

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is concerned about India’s plans to deport Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, his spokesperson Farhan Haq said. “Obviously we have our concern about the treatment of refugees. Once refugees are registered they are not to be returned back to the countries where they fear persecution,” Haq said while responding to a question about reports that India was going to send back Rohingyas.

Guterres, who was the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is deeply attached to the cause of refugees. Haq said on Monday that the UNHCR office would take up the issue with the Indian government. He reminded India of a UN dictum against deporting refugees.

“You are aware of our principle of non refoulement,” he said, referring to the doctrine in the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees. According to the principle, refugees cannot be returned to a place where their life or freedom would be “threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion”.

India has not signed the UN convention on refugees. Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju told the Lok Sabha last week: “According to UNHCR there are 13,000 Rohingya migrants registered. But we have also got figures from IB (Intelligence Bureau) which show they have migrated to India in large numbers.

“Steps are being taken to ensure that we do not get uncontrolled influx of migrants in the country, which creates lots of social, political and cultural problems. “At the same time we want to ensure the demographic pattern of India is not disturbed,” Rijiju had said.

He said a “concentration camp of Rohingyas has come up” in Jammu and Kashmir and later clarified that it was only a detention camp and not a “concentration camp” like those in Nazi Germany. Subsequently, a Home Ministry official was quoted as saying that India was in touch with Myanmar and Bangladesh to deport 40,000 Rohingyas illegally in India. UNHCR office in India has reportedly issued refugee IDs to about 16,500 Rohingyas in India.

President Donald Trump disbands business councils after CEOs exit in protest,"US President Donald Trump announced the break-up of the advisory councils after 3M Co’s Inge Thulin became the latest of several chief executives to leave Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, and the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum broke up of its own will.

(Source: AP)

US President Donald Trump disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils on Wednesday after corporate CEOs quit in protest at his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, not only on white nationalists but also on the protesters who opposed them. A parade of prominent Republicans and US ally Britain rebuked Trump after his Tuesday comments on Saturday’s bloodshed further enveloped his seven-month-old presidency in controversy and paralyzed his policy aims.

Trump announced the break-up of the advisory councils after 3M Co’s Inge Thulin became the latest of several chief executives to leave Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, and the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum broke up of its own will.

“Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ohio Governor John Kasich, Senator Lindsey Graham, former US presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and others took aim at the remarks by Trump that worsened deep divisions within a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress and the White House.

A former senior Trump administration official raised the prospect that some White House officials could quit because of Trump’s comments.

“If you have some high-profile individuals leaving, you may have a whole host of high-profile individuals leaving,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

McConnell, who last week drew Trump’s ire over the Senate’s failure to pass healthcare legislation, issued a statement saying “messages of hate and bigotry” from white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups should not be welcome anywhere in the United States. McConnell’s statement did not mention Trump by name.

“We can have no tolerance for an ideology of racial hatred. There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head,” McConnell said.

US stocks had been trading near the day’s high when the latest trickle of CEO resignations emerged in early afternoon and the market weakened substantially.

In light of the developments, investors moved into the safety of US Treasury debt, sending their yields, which move in the opposite direction to bond prices, to their lows of the day. The benchmark 10-year note yield was last down 2 basis points to yield 2.24 percent.

‘BLAME ON BOTH SIDES’

Trump’s remarks on Tuesday were a more vehement reprisal of his initial response to Saturday’s bloodshed around a white nationalist rally.

In his comments at a heated news conference in New York on Tuesday, Trump said “there is blame on both sides” of the violence in Charlottesville, and that there were “very fine people” on both sides.

Kasich said there was no moral equivalency between the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and anybody else.

“This is terrible. The president of the United States needs to condemn these kind of hate groups,” Kasich said on NBC’s “Today” show. Failure to do so gave such organizations a sense of victory and license to hold more events elsewhere, said Kasich, one of Trump’s rivals for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election.

In London, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered a rare rebuke of Trump by one of the United States’ closest foreign allies.

“I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them and I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them,” May told reporters when asked to comment on Trump’s stance.

May has been widely criticized by political opponents in Britain for her efforts to cultivate close ties with Trump since he took office in January.

Vice President Mike Pence, who is cutting short a trip to Latin America, said at a news conference in Chile that “I stand with the president and I stand by those words.”

Pakistan’s Malala “excited” after winning place at Oxford University,"Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education.

Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17, said on Thursday she was “excited” after winning a place to study at Oxford University.

Yousafzai said she had been accepted at Oxford to study Politics, Philosophy, and Economics. She joined thousands of other students in Britain in discovering where they will go to university after getting their final school results.

Others to have studied the same course at Oxford, one of the world’s top universities, include former British Prime Minister David Cameron and late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

“So excited to go to Oxford!! Well done to all A-level students – the hardest year. Best wishes for life ahead!” she said in a tweet. A-levels are final year exams for school students.

After recovering from the Taliban attack, she has attended school in England.

Early figures showed a fall in the number of places allocated by universities, although the proportion of students scoring top grades rose.

University admissions service UCAS said on its website the decrease in the number of university acceptances had been driven by a fall in acceptances from older students and fewer students from the European Union.

UCAS said 416,310 people had been accepted to degree courses on A-level results day, down two percent compared to 2016. But over 1 in 4 of the grades was an A or A*, the best ratings, up 0.5 percentage points on last year.

"Economic Graffiti: Don’t be cautious, RBI","Though a big segment of India — private firms, banks and finance specialists — take a keen interest in RBI policy action, many ordinary citizens treat this as an abstruse topic, of no concern to them. Illustration: C R Sasikumar Though a big segment of India — private firms, banks and finance specialists — take a keen interest in RBI policy action, many ordinary citizens treat this as an abstruse topic, of no concern to them. Illustration: C R Sasikumar

The Reserve Bank of India’s recent decision to lower the repo rate was a move in the right direction, but I am of the view that it was not strong enough. Instead of cutting the rate by 25 basis points, it should have cut it by 50 and signalled that this is the broad direction it intends to pursue in the future.

Though a big segment of India — private firms, banks and finance specialists — take a keen interest in RBI policy action, many ordinary citizens treat this as an abstruse topic, of no concern to them. In reality, the lives of ordinary citizens are greatly affected by it. However, this happens so unobtrusively that it is easy to be unaware of it.

Hence, let me begin by explaining why this is important. The repo rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from RBI for short durations. It stands to reason that, if this is lowered, banks can lend to their borrowers at lower rates. This is the reason why changing this rate usually influences interest rates across the economy and in the same direction. It is also standard wisdom that raising the repo rate lowers inflation but also restrains growth, while lowering it pushes up the growth rate but fuels inflation.

There are several reasons why I believe the RBI should be more aggressive in cutting the repo rate and also giving forward guidance that this is the direction it will pursue in the future.

First is the fact that there is no indication of rapid, generalised inflation in India. There may be single-item price spikes, but these are caused by structural factors and bottlenecks, not overall liquidity in the economy. In an emerging economy like ours, it is good to have an inflation rate of around 3 to 4 per cent. This makes the labour market more flexible and facilitates job creation. India’s inflation has been falling over several months and is now well below 2 per cent. If anything, India now has a risk of sustained low inflation, which we know from the experience of other countries, most notably, Japan, can cause overall stagnation.

Second, India’s growth needs a shot in the arm. As a result of the liquidity crunch associated with last November’s demonetisation, overall GDP growth in India is now down to 6.1 per cent per annum. It should have by now gone back to over 8 per cent which is where it had been on a sustained basis since 2003, till the time of the global financial crisis. Some additional liquidity could partially offset this.

Further, a fact that is getting little attention but can cause long-run slowdown in India is the drop in the amount of investment taking place in the country. India’s investment-to-GDP ratio had risen since 2003 and was holding steady at above 35 per cent. This was a major factor fuelling the country’s high growth. This has now dropped to approximately 28 per cent. The positive relation between how much money a country allocates to investment, especially in long-run infrastructure, and how fast its GDP grows is one of the more enduring findings in economics. We have seen this in the case of East Asian countries that grew rapidly during the 1970s and ’80s. All of them invested over 35 per cent of their GDP. To get back to high investment, banks in India have to be given leeway to lend more and one instrument for this is a lower repo and reverse repo rate, which would allow banks to lower their interest rates and that would encourage entrepreneurs to borrow more and invest in long-run projects.

These are fairly standard arguments but there is another reason behind my recommendation that is not talked about enough. The world is today caught in a low-interest rate regime. The European Central Bank pioneered this by cutting its overnight deposit facility rate to below zero, specifically to -0.10, in June 2014; and this prompted central banks in other countries — Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, Hungary — to cut policy rates and enter negative territory.

It is now increasingly evident that this is not good for these countries because such extreme low rates are, far from boosting consumption, making people save more since they are worried about not having enough money at the time of their retirement. This has created a classic “trap” that economists talk about: No country can individually break away from it without doing damage to itself. It is easy to see this. If one of these countries raises interest rates, in today’s globalised world, money will flow into the country from the other economies in order to earn the higher return. And as more players try to buy this country’s currency to invest in it, the currency will appreciate, causing exports to suffer. It is clear that it is for this reason that the Bank of Japan, after cutting its current account deposit rate to -0.10 in January 2016, is not able to pull away sharply from this.

And it is not just these nations, all big players are caught in this. Even the US Fed is more cautious about raising rates than it would have been, since it does not want to raise the demand for dollars which would cause the dollar to appreciate and hurt American exports.

This is where India is erring. By holding on to high interest rates, it is attracting capital flows into the country, as evidenced by the large foreign exchange reserve held by the Reserve Bank. I believe this is causing the rupee to be stronger than it should be and this is, in turn, stunting exports, and also growth.

An economy is a complex machine and its well-being depends on a fine balance of policies that have to be crafted by the best professionals. The RBI’s policy action is just one instrument and I do not want to over-emphasise its significance. But at this juncture, it could have played a major role in steadying the Indian ship and even speeding it up a little.

German minister eyes quotas for female execs unless firms step up,"Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, waves following the start of the CDU’s election rally for Germany’s general election in Dortmund, Germany August 12, 2017.

(REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay)

A government minister on Tuesday blasted German companies for failing to add more women to their management boards, suggesting the government could impose quotas unless firms acted to boost the current rate of 6 percent. Family Minister Katarina Barley, a Social Democrat (SPD), told the RND newspaper chain it was unacceptable that companies had failed to increase the percentage of women in leadership roles after years of promises.

“I give industry one more year to take care of the issue itself. If nothing has happened by then, we’ll have to take legislative action,” Barley told the newspapers in an interview to be published Wednesday. “In many management boards, nothing has happened. Only 6 percent of directors are women. That can’t continue,” she said.

Barley is due to present a report to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet about representation of women in leadership positions on Wednesday. She said she had “no problem with an obligatory quota for women on management boards”, noting that years of pledges had not changed the situation and many companies had a target of zero.

Under German law, women must comprise 30 percent of the supervisory boards of large companies. But there is no law governing the make-up of management boards. Barley’s Social Democrats are now the junior partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives in a “grand coalition,” but both parties hope to forge alliances with other small parties and lead the country after a parliamentary election on Sept. 24.

The latest Insa poll showed Merkel’s conservatives with 37 percent support, the SPD with 25 percent, and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party with 10 percent. Both the pro-business Free Democrats and the far-left Left party had 9 percent support, while the pro-environment Greens were at 3 percent.

Don’t believe in ghosts? Wait till you get to know about the ‘creepy bridal doll’,"This doll is not your average Barbie. (Source: Lee Steer/Facebook) This doll is not your average Barbie. (Source: Lee Steer/Facebook)

Yes, it is the 21st century. Nobody believes in ghosts. They exist only in movies. Right? Well, not really. Or that is what Lee Steer, a paranormal-investigator based out of Rotherham, England, seems to imply. Steer reportedly bought a possessed doll online after paying about £866 (around Rs 71,000). According to Ladbible, the doll’s previous owner put it up for sale on eBay after it began ‘attacking’ her husband, setting off fire-alarms, taking off its necklace, etc.

Now, after Steer bought the doll for research and investigation, it is his father who found himself at the receiving end of the possessed doll’s wrath. Steer, who has done live streams on social media with the doll, trying to understand its truth, said it attacked his father while he was watching the repeat of one of the live streams. “Later that day he was watching the repeat of one of our live streams with the doll. I was doing a live stream upstairs in my room. Then he said to my mum, ‘My arm’s hurting’. He lifted up his sleeve and he had six scratches on his arm,” Steer said.

Named ‘Elizabeth’, Steer even made live videos with the ‘creepy bridal doll.’ indianexpress.com hasn’t been able to verify the authenticity of these claims, but the videos have gone viral and are being widely shared online.

Watch the videos here.

Along with Steer, Deborah Davis, another researcher, uploaded videos with the doll, trying to establish the paranormal connection. In one of the live streams, she claims to have recorded orbs that it is emitting towards her.

"Cloning of debit, credit cards: Key accused held, search on for 4 Nigerians","Officials of the Cyber Crime Cell with the arrested accused. Officials of the Cyber Crime Cell with the arrested accused.

THE Cyber Crime Cell of the Pune City Police has arrested a Nigerian man who is allegedly the key accused in a racket to clone debit and credit cards. Police have identified the accused as Eremhen Smart (33), a resident of Supragiri College area in Bengaluru. Police have also arrested his alleged aide Irshad Sattar Solanki (28), a resident of Bandrekar Wadi in Jogeshwari, Mumbai.

Last month, police had arrested three Nigerian men — identified as Ogbehase Fortune, Bashar Dakin Gari Usman and Ifeanyi Mike Bbaeze — while investigating a case registered with the Khadki police station, in which Rs 67,000 was withdrawn from a person’s bank account without his knowledge. While some money was withdrawn from an ATM, the rest of the money was transferred to another bank account.

A team led by Inspector Manish Zende of the Cyber Crime Cell zeroed in on a person seen in the camera footage from the ATM kiosk. Police also got details of the account to which the money was transferred, and it was revealed that the account had been used to withdraw cash from other ATM kiosks.

Following leads obtained during the investigation, police arrested Nigerian national Fortune from Pimple Gurav, and his alleged aides Usman and Mbaeze. Police also recovered eight cell phones, 20 debit cards and eight blocked cards that had been cloned, Internet dongles, pen drives and a laptop from the trio.

Soon, police launched a search for the key accused — Smart — who was found to be changing his locations frequently. On August 10, police laid a trap and arrested Smart in Bengaluru. They recovered four cell phones, two laptops and Rs 1.65 lakh in cash from him.

On August 14, police arrested Smart’s “aide” Irshad Solanki, who allegedly helped him withdraw money from ATMs and “arranged” bank accounts, in which the money was transferred using cloned debit and credit cards.

A court has remanded the duo to police custody till August 17 for further investigation.

“We are now searching for four more persons, all Nigerian nationals, involved in this racket. We are also looking for a Mumbai-based person who helped the accused commit the crimes,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Crime Cell, Sudhir Hiremath, during a press conference on Wednesday.

Hiremath said that the “same gang of Nigerians had committed 11 crimes in Bengaluru and four in Pune”. The four cases in Pune are registered at police stations in Khadki, Chinchwad and Hinjewadi

The investigation revealed that Smart ordered ATM card readers and debit card writer machines online and used them to clone the debit and credit cards.

Police said the accused used ‘skimmer’, an electronic device that steals the information or identity of the card. Skimmers are mounted in front of the slot in ATM machines where the card is inserted. So, while the user thinks he is inserting the card in the slot, the card is also passing through the skimmer and details of the debit or credit card is being stolen.

The accused then used pinhole or spy cameras installed in ATMs to learn the customer’s PIN number, said police, adding that at times, they also stood behind the customer when the PIN was being typed. The stolen information is then written on other cards and the card is cloned. The customer gets to know of the fraud only when the money is withdrawn, said police.

However, police have not recovered any ‘skimmer” from Smart and the other accused arrested in the case. Police suspect that the accused have destroyed the skimmers.

The investigation has revealed that the ‘gang’ had obtained information about several debit and credit cards in Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, parts of Tamil Nadu and Goa, said police. The accused allegedly made cloned cards and used it to withdraw and transfer money to different bank accounts. ‘Key accused is a science graduate’

DCP Hiremath said Smart, the key accused, is a Computer Science graduate who had come to India on a medical visa in 2014. He extended his visa later, but it expired in 2016. He was arrested by Bengaluru police in January, but was released on bail. According to police, Smart enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, and he also used to send some money to Nigeria through

“middlemen”.

Zimbabwe’s leader Robert Mugabe in South Africa after wife is accused of assault,"Veteran Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe. (Source: Reuters) Veteran Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe. (Source: Reuters)

Veteran Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe has arrived in South Africa, state media said on Friday, for a regional summit overshadowed by accusations his wife assaulted a 20-year-old model in a Johannesburg hotel room with an electric cable. Zimbabwe’s Herald newspaper, the government’s main mouthpiece, said 93-year-old Mugabe arrived at a military air base near Pretoria late on Thursday. The Herald made no mention of the controversy swirling around his 52-year-old wife Grace, who has applied for diplomatic immunity to protect herself from possible assault charges, according to South African police.

Debbie Engels, the mother of the alleged victim, Gabriella, told Reuters her daughter had received 14 stitches on her head from Sunday’s assault – which the mother did not witness – and demanded Mugabe face justice.

She showed Reuters photographs taken in the hours after the incident showing gashes on Gabriella’s forehead and the back of her head. Another picture, taken on Wednesday, showed a large, livid bruise on her thigh.

“I just want justice for my daughter. It’s not about money. It’s about justice. She attacked my child for no reason,” she said. Reuters has not been able to verify key aspects of the assault allegations independently.

There has been no official comment from Harare and requests for comment from Mugabe’s spokesman and from Information Minister Chris Mushowe have gone unanswered.

Reuters has also been unable to identify Grace Mugabe’s lawyers in South Africa. Zimbabwe’s ambassador to Pretoria, Isaac Moyo, has also declined to name them, or provide comment.

Bomb kills 13 in southern Yemen,"A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting alongside the government since 2015. A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting alongside the government since 2015.

A bomb went off on Monday at a busy district in a southern Yemeni city, killing 13 people and wounding an unspecified number, according to security officials. They said the explosion struck a market in Qataba, in the southern Dhale province, but provided no further details. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but al-Qaida and Islamic State militants are active in southern Yemen.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press.

Dhale is controlled by forces loyal to the internationally recognized government, which is at war with Shiite rebels known as the Houthis and their allies. A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting alongside the government since 2015.

"Felt inferior to Real Madrid for the first time, says Gerard Pique","Barcelona’s Gerard Pique in action with Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema. (Source: Reuters) Barcelona’s Gerard Pique in action with Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema. (Source: Reuters)

After Real Madrid defeated Barcelona by an aggregate of 5-1 to win the Spanish Super Cup, Gerard Pique said that he felt inferior to Madrid for the first time in nine years.

Pique, who scored an own goal in the first leg at Camp Nou, accepted that they were not in the best moment, both as a team and as a club. “The season is very long and there is room for improvement,” Pique said. “But in nine years at Barcelona this is the first time that I have felt we are inferior to Madrid.”

“It is true that they won the Champions League last year, but we came here and won not long before that. We are not in the best moment, as a team or a club. This a long process and there is room for improvement, We must stay as close as possible and keep moving forwards.”

“It is important for us to live with the defeat and accept that Madrid were better,” Pique added.

The second leg of El Clasico saw a fantastic goal by Marco Asensio, as Karim Benzema doubled the lead for Los Blancos, outclassing Pique and Barca, who are without Neymar. The Brazilian saw a record transfer to French club Paris Saint Germain earlier this month.

Zinedine Zidane’s men saw the victory without their key strikers Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.

"Jese loaned out by PSG, looks to relaunch career at Stoke City","Jese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke City this off season to join West Ham United. (Source: AP) Jese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke City this off season to join West Ham United. (Source: AP)

Spanish forward Jese will attempt to relaunch his stuttering career in England after leaving Paris Saint-Germain to become the latest Champions League winner at Stoke on Wednesday.

The 24-year-old Jese joined Stoke on a season-long loan after failing to settle at PSG following his move from Real Madrid for a reported 25 million euros ($29 million) in August 2016. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish team Las Palmas.

Also, Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson is close to sealing a drawn-out transfer to Everton after completing a medical examination. Everton is reportedly paying 45 million pounds ($58 million) for the Iceland international, wo would be a fourth attacking player to arrive at Goodison Park this summer after Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez and Davy Klaassen.

Stoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have stalled.

Since 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have Champions League winners’ medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.

Most were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.

“Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we’re delighted he has chosen to join us,” Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. “He hasn’t had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he’s still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.”

Jese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.

Stoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.

The team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday. Jese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real’s reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.

He signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute. Although technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery’s plans although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.

Jese is Stoke’s sixth signing of the summer transfer window.

Gujarat sees 53 per cent jump in illegal mining in four years,"Quoting the “quarterly returns on illegal mining submitted by the Government of Gujarat to Indian Bureau of Mines,” the minister stated that the instances of illegal mining include both major and minor minerals. Quoting the “quarterly returns on illegal mining submitted by the Government of Gujarat to Indian Bureau of Mines,” the minister stated that the instances of illegal mining include both major and minor minerals.

The number of illegal mining instances has risen by nearly 53 per cent in the last four years in Gujarat, with 8,325 cases being registered in 2016-17 against 5,447 in 2013-14. This despite the availability of satellite imageries and mining surveillance systems.

Between April 2013-March 2017, as many as 25,987 cases of illegal mining were registered across Gujarat, according to data furnished by Piyush Goyal, MoS (Independent Charge) for Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines, in a written reply in Lok Sabha earlier this month.

Quoting the “quarterly returns on illegal mining submitted by the Government of Gujarat to Indian Bureau of Mines,” the minister stated that the instances of illegal mining include both major and minor minerals.

“The Ministry of Mines has taken the initiative to adopt the use of Space Technology through Mining Surveillance System to support state governments in curbing illegal mining. Further, stringent penal provisions have been provided in the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 for control of illegal mining,” Goyal stated in his reply.

However, the measures appear to having little impact on ground where despite a total of 25,987 cases of illegal mining clocked in the four-year period, the number of FIRs filed in this regard was just 318, and the number of court cases filed stood at 29. The state government, meanwhile, has realised Rs 131.82 crore in fines in connection with the illegal mining, stated the reply.

Roopwant Singh, the head of Commissionerate of Geology and Mining, the Government of Gujarat, told The Indian Express that the increased number of illegal mining cases was largely due to increased vigilance in the mining sector.

“Gujarat has about 7,800 mining leases of which 468 are for major minerals like limestone, lignite and bauxite that contribute to 45 per cent of the annual revenues…. In the last three years, in order to check illegal mining, we have stepped up efforts on three fronts. We have increased roadside checking. We have set up permanent check-posts on certain routes. Though cumbersome and long-drawn, we also check stocks of mined material and also do a physical check of the mined area,” said Singh.

The Gujarat government from February 1, 2016, has set up check-posts on seven stretches — Harshad-Miyani and Dwarka-Okha roads in Devbhumi Dwarka, Nasvadi road in Chotta Udepur, Kim-Kamrej road in Surat, Bagodra in Ahmedabad, Chiloda in Gandhinagar and Samakhiyali in Kutch district.

The government has also developed a mobile application — GeoMine — that helps check vehicles and on-time verification of royalty pass with barcode. It has also adapted a “special security paper A” to control printing of duplicate royalty pass and delivery challans. It has also integrated the data from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) with the existing ILMS (integrated lease management system) to check overloading of vehicles carrying minerals.

“Through e-governance measures, we have also enforced regular attendance of officials who keep an eye out on illegal mining,” said Singh, adding that the state government has been able to recover Rs 42 crore of dues from defaulters last year. State governments are empowered under Section 23C of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, to make rules and for prevention of illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals.

Talking about the fewer number of FIRs lodged in comparison to the total number of cases, Singh said, “The FIRs are registered only when the illegal mining has happened outside the leased area or on government land. The penalty mostly imposed is the value of the mineral caught and the royalty. However, the penalties will soon be revised and will be more stringent.”

Gujarat produces 59 minerals, of which 38 are major and 21 minor minerals with sizeable reserves of limestone and lignite. According to the data tabled by the state government in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly earlier this year, the districts of Surat, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Bharuch, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Panchmahal and Gandhinagar reported higher incidences of illegal mining. For instance, between December 2015 to November 2016, Surat reported a phenomenal 1,298 cases of illegal mining, followed by Gandhinagar (522 cases) and Ahmedabad (512 cases).

Exercise mimicking protein may aid heart failure patients,"CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo) CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo)

Scientists have discovered a protein that mimics exercise and tricks the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood, a finding that can aid in developing treatments for heart failure patients. The study showed that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) leads heart to pump more blood even if an individual is sitting still, making it beneficial, particularly for people with heart problems who find it hard to exercise.

CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. Heart failure, which occurs when the heart can’t pump enough blood through the body, is a leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries and a growing problem around the world. “When part of the heart dies, the remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger but this happens in a dysfunctional way and it doesn’t actually help the heart pump more blood,” said Lynn Megeney, Professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada.

“We found that CT1 causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart. This actually increases the heart’s ability to pump blood, just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,” Megeney added For the study, published in the journal Cell Research, the team conducted a variety of experiments in mice, rats and cells growing in the lab. Heart muscle cells treated with CT-1 were found to become longer and demonstrated healthier fibres.

Further, CT-1 also improved heart function in two animal models of heart failure one caused by a heart attack (affecting the left side of the heart) and one caused by high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension, affecting the right side of the heart). “This experimental therapy is very exciting particularly because it shows promise in treating both left and right heart failure,” said Duncan Stewart, a cardiologist at the Ottawa Hospital.

"Partition museum to open in Amritsar, 70 years after the painful event","In the 70 years since India and Pakistan were created from the former British Empire, there has never been a venue focused on the stories and memorabilia of those who survived that chaotic and bloody chapter in history until now. A new museum on the Partition of the Indian subcontinent opens this week, as the two South Asian giants mark seven decades as independent nations.



The exhibitions are housed in the red-brick Town Hall building in the north Indian border city of Amritsar. They include photographs, newspaper clippings and donated personal items meant to tell the story of how the region’s struggle for freedom from colonial rule turned into one of its most violent episodes.

UK inquiry to examine Grenfell Tower fire but not broader social issues,"The burnt Grenfell Tower apartment building stands testament to the recent fire in London, Friday, June 23, 2017.

A public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire in London that killed 80 people in June began on Tuesday with a mission to examine the cause of and response to the tragedy, but not broader issues such as social housing policy. The destruction of the 24-storey social housing block, home to a poor, multi-ethnic community, in an inferno that spread with terrifying speed in the middle of the night shocked the nation and raised public anger over social inequalities.

The inquiry, led by retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, was announced by Prime Minister Theresa May to show she wanted the truth about the disaster to emerge after her initial response was seen by survivors as slow and insensitive. Its terms of reference were published on Tuesday.

They are to examine the cause and spread of the fire, the design, construction and refurbishment of the tower, fire regulations relating to high-rise buildings, whether they were complied with at Grenfell Tower, and the actions of the authorities before and after the tragedy. Moore-Bick said the inquiry would not delve into broader issues such as social housing policy and the relationship between the community and the authorities, even though many local people wanted it to.

He said this was because it would take too long when there was a need for the inquiry to quickly identify safety issues that may be putting lives at risk in other tower blocks. He also said the broader issues would raise political questions that would not be best addressed by a judge-led inquiry.

Sergio Busquets defends Gerard Pique after Barcelona general manager criticism,"Sergio Busquets said Pep Segura should not have focused on his team mate after the heavy defeat by Barcelona’s rivals. (Source: Reuters) Sergio Busquets said Pep Segura should not have focused on his team mate after the heavy defeat by Barcelona’s rivals. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets hit back at the club’s general manager Pep Segura on Tuesday, after he blamed Gerard Pique’s own goal for causing their 3-1 Spanish Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid.

Segura claimed Pique’s error was “decisive, it changed the game completely”, after the defender diverted Marcelo’s cross into his own goal to break the deadlock at the Nou Camp in Sunday’s first leg.

Busquets, however, said Segura should not have focused on his team mate after the heavy defeat by Barcelona’s rivals.

“The play (Pique’s own goal) was bad luck. We lost 3-1 because we committed some errors and they were very good when it came to finishing,” Busquets told a news conference on Tuesday.

“You don’t lose because of one play. (This is) not the way to express yourself and even less so from inside the club, singling out a player.”

Busquets said Barcelona needed to make signings after the first-leg defeat and reiterated that on the eve of the return at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The Catalans on Monday agreed a 40 million euros ($46.95 million)deal to sign Guangzhou Evergrande midfielder Paulinho.

Busquets, however, is still hoping for further reinforcements, especially after Paris St Germain signed Neymar for 222 million euros earlier this month.

“There’s only one Neymar. We have to look forwards,” said Busquets. “With Neymar leaving we need, above all, attacking players.

“We have a good team, we’re capable of having a great season, that’s what we’re focusing on. We want to convince the fans but the off-the-field situation is not up to me. I hope a lot of signings come and that they are of the highest quality.”

Coach Ernesto Valverde believes Barcelona can still win the Super Cup, saying his side do not feel weaker than Madrid.

“Clearly we start from behind, but looking at the statistics nothing is impossible,” said the coach. “No… I’m not going to say (Madrid are superior).

“Maybe at certain times, as they showed on Sunday when they took their chances. But does that mean they’re better than us? No, I don’t think that’s a conclusion which should be drawn.”

In 1948, Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination sent shock waves across newly independent India. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was banned by Sardar Patel, the then Home Minister and a committed Gandhian, who called it a “cult of violence”.

India’s central banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India, was nationalised in 1949.In 1950, India became a republic upon the enactment of the Constitution and guaranteed universal adult suffrage to all its citizens.

The Planning Commission was set up on March 15, 1950, and the first Five Year Plan, the bedrock of how development was to be planned, pushed and executed in the country, got underway.

From 1951-59, the first Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Kharagpur, Chennai, Powai and Kanpur were set up. This enshrined the idea that technical education was not a luxury, but a necessity for a newly independent, even if poor country, like India.

India started work on what Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first Prime Minister, called the “temples of modern India” — large hydro-electric projects such as the Bhakra Nangal Dam (completed in 1963), Hirakud Dam (completed in 1957) among others.

The first democratically elected Communist government in the world assumed office in Kerala in 1957. It was dismissed by the Centre in two years, but it made history, nonetheless.

K Asif’s magnum-opus Mughal-e-Azam released in August 1960. Asif, apparently, came upon the idea in 1944, after reading a play and had to wait for a long time to get financiers for the film.

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, became the first IIM to be set up on November 13, 1961. Like in the case of the IITs, the idea that the state could subsidise higher education was an audacious one.

The 1962 India-China War over Aksai-chin led to a defeat for India and had serious internal consequences. Nehru’s health took a beating, never to recover, and the non-Left Opposition in the country gained ground. Thousands of Communist members and supporters were arrested.

Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre was set up in 1963.

Another war with Pakistan a year after Nehru’s death in 1964 kept the country on tenterhooks. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the then Prime Minister, mindful of the food crisis as well as the mood of the country, coined the slogan, ‘Jai jawan jai kisan’.

1966 saw the then PM Indira Gandhi devalue the Indian rupee by one-third. The move came under heavy criticism, but it was done in the context of a very shaky balance of payments situation and food insufficiency. Droughts that year resulted in massive food shortage and India had to shop for food in the international world market. The move was criticised heavily, but the devaluation managed to reduce the astronomical fiscal deficit at the time.

Dr Reita Faria became the first Asian woman to win the Miss World pageant in 1966. It would be nearly three decades later that Sushmita Sen would win another beauty pageant in 1994.

The Green Revolution was ushered in in the early Sixties, with the introduction of high-yield variety of crops, eventually leading India to food self-sufficiency.

India won its first Test cricket series in New Zealand in 1968.

Banks were nationalised in 1969 by Indira Gandhi. This was a landmark moment in Indian economics and politics and earned Gandhi her spurs as a pro-poor Leader, which reaped results in the 1971 elections.

Dr V Kurien launched a cooperative milk revolution, the White Revolution, in Gujarat in 1970, enabling women to share the economic prosperity ushered in by their efforts. It was memorialised in the Shyam Benegal film, Manthan (1976). In 1988, the World Bank published an audit which “revealed that of the Rs 200 crore the World Bank invested in Operation Flood (Kurien’s project), the net return on India’s rural economy was a massive Rs 24,000 crore each year over a period of 10 years, to which no other dairy programme has ever matched.”

In 1970, the Department of Electronics (DoE) was set up to “promote the rapid growth of electronics and computers”. Between 1971 and 1978, a company called the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) was set up to lay emphasis on the indigenous design and development of computers, using primarily India-made components. ECIL made the TDC 312 and TDC 316 computers.

Bangladesh was carved out of East Pakistan after a civil war, in which India sided with the Mukti Bahinis of Bangladesh. The Simla Agreement was signed after the conclusion of the India-Pakistan war in 1971, laying the basis of peace with Pakistan for nearly three decades.

Project Tiger was launched in 1973. Its main objective was to ensure a viable population of tigers in India and to preserve areas of biological importance as a “natural heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people”.

The Kesavanand Bharati case was heard before the Supreme Court in 1973. It gave birth to the crucial “basic structure” doctrine of the Constitution. If it did not tamper with India’s “basic structure”, any law could be legislated and could pass muster.

Pokharan nuclear test in 1974 led to the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group internationally to try and restrict India after its show of strength.

Aryabhata, India’s first satellite, was launched in 1975. Built by ISRO, it was launched from Kapustin Yar in the then-USSR. RBI kept the image of Aryabhata on the reverse of the Rs 2 note from 1976 to 1997.

Ramesh Sippy’s Sholay was released in1975, a landmark multi-starrer that became the benchmark for decades to come. Four of the top stars — Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jaya Bhaduri and Hema Malini – went onto become Members of Parliament. The film launched Amjad Khan as the very impressive villain, Gabbar Singh.

The Constitution was amended very significantly in 1976 and the words “secular” and “socialist” added to the Preamble.

The first non-Congress government was formed at the Centre in 1977. Several parties came together as the Janata Party to fight Emergency. Jayaprakash Narayan was the central figure and leader of this anti-Congress formation. Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister after the electoral win.

Jyoti Basu became the chief minister of West Bengal in 1977 and helmed the longest-serving elected Communist government in the world.

In 1983, India won the Cricket World Cup under Kapil Dev.

On April 2, 1984, Rakesh Sharma became the first and only Indian to travel in space aboard the Soyuz T-11. When asked by PM Indira Gandhi about what he thought of India from space, he famously replied, “Saare jahan se achha.”

India moved into Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world, in 1984. This is a disputed glacier in Kashmir and while a ceasefire was declared in 2003, it remains a battleground to date.

Operation Blue Star, a campaign by the Indian Army against separatists demanding Khalistan under the leadership of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, attacked the spiritual nerve of the Sikh community — the Golden Temple in Amritsar in June 1984. The extensive damage caused to the shrine, shattered Sikhs, mostly not sympathetic to the Khalistan cause.

In July 1984, India’s first soap opera, Hum Log, scripted by well-known Hindi writer Manohar Shyam Joshi started being telecast on Doordarshan. This was said to have been inspired by a Mexican soap but its portrayals of a middle-class Indian family remain memorable.

Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her security guards in 1984, as revenge for Operation Blue Star. What was shameful for independent India was the organised anti-Sikh pogroms that followed. In 2005, then PM Manmohan Singh would apologise to the nation for the “the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our Constitution”.

In 1986, Harsha Chawda became the first Indian test-tube baby. She made Dr Indira Hinduja, an in-vitro fertilisation expert, a star at the time. Chawda, incidentally, became a mother last year.

In 1987, the Parliament enacted a special law to reverse a Supreme Court order around maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, to restore what was the primacy of Muslim Personal Law over the lives of Muslim citizens. This gave the Hindu right wing a loud campaign message.

After two decades of conflict between the Mizos and the Indian state, in June, 1986, the Mizoram Accord was signed between Rajiv Gandhi and Laldenga. This had a very significant bearing on peace in the north-eastern states.

1989 saw Salman Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses banned in India. It was the first country to do so, but several others followed suit. It eventually led to a fatwa by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini against Rushdie. This was a dark moment and an indication how plural democracies would not commit to freedom of expression.

In the early Nineties, the situation in Kashmir deteriorated with Kashmiri Pandits being forced to leave the Valley as murderous attacks on them made their stay impossible.

The Mandal Commission, arguing for the need for special quotas for Other Backward Classes in government jobs, was submitted to the government in 1980, but was gathering dust till VP Singh decided to implement it in August 1990. The move was to result in a huge tumult, especially in north India. First, anti-Mandal protests and then pro-Mandal protests erupted across the country. Leaders who made a mark in the anti-Mandal and pro-Mandal protests would go on to dominate Indian politics for the next three decades.

In Kerala, the total literacy movement was first initiated in Ernakulam district and Kottayam municipality in the late ’80s. On 4th of February 1990, the then Prime Minister Shri VP Singh declared Ernakulam as the first totally literate district in India.

Economic liberalisation was kicked off formally by then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the first budget after the Congress returned to power in 1991. It was a move that transformed India’s economy, politics and society.

Former PM Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in May 1991, while on campaign in Sriperumbudur. It would go on to change the course of Indian politics.

Panchayat elections became mandatory in 1992, kicking off a silent revolution as elected leadership at local levels provided a basis for deepening democracy in the years to come.

Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was pulled down by a mob, mobilised over months in 1992. It opened up a communal fault line that continues to divide Indian politics.

Satyajit Ray, the legendary Bengali filmmaker, was awarded an Honorary Oscar in 1992 for Lifetime Achievement by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 1995, Aditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge was released both in India and internationally. It would establish Shah Rukh Khan as an enduring star.

After 1948, Leander Paes won the first individual medal for India in Olympics in 1996.

The cellphone came to India in 1996. West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu held the first mobile phone conversation in the country.

In 1999, following massive cross-border infiltration, India and Pakistan would face off at Kargil. Pakistan was led by General Pervez Musharraf, who went on to become President of Pakistan.

The hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane flying into Delhi from Kathmandu by the Taliban in 1999 remains one of India’s most dramatic stories of a negotiation gone wrong. Eventually, three terrorists in Indian jails had to be released in exchange for the safe passage of passengers aboard the ill-fated IC 814.

In the late Nineties, Cable TV connected India in a way few things have done. BBC, CNN were all bold and beautiful and put India, slowly but surely, on a path of irreversible information and media integration.

After the attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the biggest military build-up along the border with Pakistan took place, an “eyeball to eyeball” confrontation, as India held Pakistan repsonsible for the assault on the Parliament complex. This was termed Operation Parakram. It finally ended in 2004, with PM Vajpayee’s visit to Pakistan in January and the start of a cross-LoC bus.

Australia drops asylum-seeker secrecy laws,"Immigration Minister Peter Dutton (AP Photo/File) Immigration Minister Peter Dutton (AP Photo/File)

Australia is scrapping secrecy laws designed to stop whistleblowers from speaking out about alleged abuse at offshore asylum-seeker detention camps, in a move which campaigners on Monday hailed as a victory for free speech.

Asylum-seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are either turned back or sent to remote camps in Nauru and on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island. Refugee advocates and medical professionals have long criticised conditions in the camps, where some detainees have been held for years.

The secrecy provisions were introduced in 2015, making it a jailable offence for immigration department workers to speak out about conditions in the centres. But Immigration Minister Peter Dutton last week moved an amendment to the law to restrict the definition of unauthorised disclosures to information relating to the national or public interest.

He told parliament last week the 2015 changes had “not kept pace with the developments in the modern border environment”. “The definition of the information to be protected has been refined to include only certain kinds of information such as national security and defence,” Dutton added.

The previous provisions were set to be challenged in the High Court by rights group Doctors for Refugees, which welcomed the government’s U-turn. “This is a stunning victory for anyone in Australia who believes people who are concerned about abuse or neglect should be allowed to speak out,” Barri Phatarfod from Doctors for Refugees said in a statement Monday.

A PNG court ruled last year that holding people on Manus was unconstitutional, and Canberra is set to shut the camp later this year. The detainees will be moved to third countries such as the US and Cambodia or be resettled in PNG. Canberra has been criticised for its asylum-seeker policies but defends its tough stance as necessary to stamp out people-smuggling and stop asylum-seekers dying at sea in rickety boats.

Crude oil opens new vistas in India-US relationship,"The first lot of two million barrels costs 0 million, but given the volume being contemplated by Indian companies, this new development is expected to boost the bilateral oil trade to billion. The first lot of two million barrels costs 0 million, but given the volume being contemplated by Indian companies, this new development is expected to boost the bilateral oil trade to billion.

The first shipment of American crude oil is likely to reach India in the last week of September, opening new vistas in the Indo-US ties. With this India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, joins Asian countries like South Korea, Japan and China to buy American crude after production cuts by OPEC drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulphur content. “New breakthroughs! oil shipments frm US to India has started,” the Indian Embassy in Washington tweeted yesterday after Indian Ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, handed over papers for the shipment to the Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

The first lot of two million barrels costs $100 million, but given the volume being contemplated by Indian companies, this new development is expected to boost the bilateral oil trade to $2 billion. “Opening New Vistas in India US Co-opn,” tweeted the Indian Embassy in Washington DC which also posted several pictures and a video of the event.

Consignments of American crude oil left the US shores between August 6-14 and is likely to reach Paradip (Odisha) in the last week of September. While the 40-year-old ban on export of American oil was lifted by the then US President Barack Obama in December 2015, the real move started during the maiden meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump on June 26 when the two leaders agreed to deepen the engagement in the energy sector.

Soon thereafter, Indian companies started purchasing crude from the US. Two Indian oil giants, Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, placed orders for over four million barrels. The development was welcomed by Trump in his phone call with Modi. “In his call with Prime Minister Modi on Monday, President Trump welcomed the first-ever shipment of American crude oil to India, which will occur from Texas later this month,” a State Department spokesperson told PTI.

“The President pledged that the United States would continue to be a reliable, long-term supplier of energy,” the spokesperson said in response to a question.

“During the Prime Minister’s June visit to the White House, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi committed to a comprehensive review of their trade relations with the goal of creating a fair and reciprocal trading relationship and removing obstacles to growth and jobs creation, including in the energy sector,” the spokesperson added.

The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd placed its first order in July and the second order on August 10. Bharat Petroleum Corp made its first purchase of US oil, buying high Sulphur crudes Mars and Poseidon. BPCL has bought a cargo containing 500,000 barrels each of Mars and Poseidon for delivery from September 26 to October 10. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) is also looking at buying US crude oil.

IOC Director (Finance) A K Sharma told PTI recently that buying US crude has become attractive for Indian refiners after the differential between Brent (the benchmark crude or marker crude that serves as a reference price for buyers in western world) and Dubai (which serves as a benchmark for countries in the east) has narrowed.

Even after including the shipping cost, buying US crude is cost competitive to Indian refiners, he said. “We are not looking at any term (or fixed quantity) deal from US as of now. We will tender to buy crude and if the US crude is competitive as compared to others, we will buy it,” he said.

Over the next 20 years, India’s energy consumption growth is projected to be the fastest among all major economies. And by 2035, China and India will have the largest share of global demand (35 per cent).

While this is the first crude oil import from the US, Indian companies have made significant investment in purchasing energy assets in the United States. Four Indian public and private sector companies have invested approximately $ 5 billion in shale assets in the US.

Indian companies have also contracted 9 MMTPA of LNG from the US and the first shipment is expected in Jan 2018. Of this, GAIL has contracted 5.8 MMT per annum, including 3.5 MMTPA of LNG from Sabine Pass Liquefaction terminal (Louisiana) and 2.3 MMTPA from Cove Point LNG liquefaction project (Maryland). In a tweet a day earlier, Senator Ted Cruz said Texas will provide crucial oil exports to India and serve as a reliable long-term supplier of energy.

In a certificate issued to Sarna on the occasion, the Texas Governor said in the decades to come “this relationship will continue to be one of the world’s most significant” as the United States and India work toward common goals of prosperity, strength and peace. “As a top exporter to India with over $ 2 billion annually in exports and as the nation’s leader in crude oil reserve and production, Texas looks forward to our growing relationship with India,” Abbott said.

US president Donald Trump faces backlash over handling of Charlottesville upheaval,"President Donald Trump boards Air Force One during his departure from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Monday, Aug. 14, 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump, facing a mounting political furor and backlash from business leaders, has explicitly condemned neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists two days after a rally by hate groups in Virginia turned deadly. The Republican president’s specific denunciation of extreme right-wing organizations, whose followers constitute a devoted segment of his political base, came on Monday after a torrent of criticism from Democrats and members of his own party. Critics said Trump waited too long on Saturday to address the upheaval in Charlottesville before delivering a tepid and ambiguous message denouncing hatred and violence “on many sides.”

Two days later, yielding to pressure for a more forceful response to the biggest domestic crisis of his presidency, Trump singled out the white nationalists whose “Unite the Right” rally was widely seen as stoking the Charlottesville disturbances. “Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” Trump said in a statement to reporters at the White House on Monday.

By the time he sought to revise his message, however, the most pointed rebukes were coming not just from politicians, pundits and civil rights activists, but from the captains of American industry. In quick succession, three members of Trump’s advisory American Manufacturing Council quit in protest, led by the chief executive of one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, Kenneth Frazier of Merck & Co Inc.

TRUMP HITS BACK

The CEOs of sportswear manufacturer Under Armour semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp, Kevin Plank and Brian Krzanich, announced their resignations from the panel hours later. Trump quickly struck back on Twitter at Frazier, who is black, saying the Merck executive would now have more time to focus on lowering “ripoff” drug prices. Trump also lashed out on Monday at the media, where many commentators said his response to the Charlottesville unrest still rang hollow. “Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News media will never be satisfied…truly bad people!”

Saturday’s disturbances erupted after hundreds of white nationalists converged in Charlottesville to protest plans to remove a statue of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army in the U.S. Civil War. They were met by crowds of anti-racism demonstrators in heated confrontations that escalated into street brawls. A car then plowed into a group of the counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people.

Police identified the driver as a 20-year-old man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies. He was detained on charges of murder, malicious wounding and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. Several other people were arrested during the day as the clashes left another 15 people injured. Two state troopers involved in crowd control were killed when their helicopter crashed.

Australia pace bowler John Hastings is optimistic about his return to international cricket and is hoping that he will make the cut for selection in the upcoming tour to India. However, Hastings did have an early departure from English county cricket.

Speaking to RSN Breakfast Club Hastings said, “I had a bit of pain in my left ankle for a little while and I thought I should get it checked out, Obviously, there’s a big summer coming up and a one-day tour to India so I wanted to make sure I’d be cherry ripe, but I ended up with a hot spot in my foot.” “I’m in a moon boot for a couple weeks and then I’ll reload and hopefully be all right for the domestic one-day cup and that one-day series (in India) Hot spots are a hard one to gauge on giving a time frame, sometimes you’re back in six weeks and sometimes it’s 12 weeks,” he said.

“I’m in a moon boot for a couple weeks and then I’ll reload and hopefully be all right for the domestic one-day cup and that one-day series (in India) Hot spots are a hard one to gauge on giving a time frame, sometimes you’re back in six weeks and sometimes it’s 12 weeks,” he said and added, “But they’re telling me this one isn’t as bad as what I’ve had previously, so hopefully, I’ll pull it out of the moon boot in a couple of weeks and it’ll feel all right. From my point of view, I want to give myself the best chance of being on that tour, because I’m getting to the age where you never know when it’s going to be your last one.”

It may be recalled here that Hastings has been in England in April and was featured for the Australian side in the ICC Champions Trophy.

Two Egyptian policemen were killed in separate attacks in North Sinai province on Tuesday, security sources said. Unknown gunmen fired shots at a policeman in North Sinai’s capital city of Arish before fleeing, a source told Reuters, adding the policeman’s body had been transferred to a military hospital. The other policeman was killed in a similar attack in the same city, another security source said.

Attacks on Egyptian security forces have been common since the military led by general-turned-President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi in 2013. The attacks have mostly been concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula where Egypt is fighting an insurgency, but in recent months they have expanded to target Coptic Christians, Egypt’s largest minority.

"By end of September, BMC hopes to reduce waste generation by 1000 metric tonnes in Mumbai","The Solid Waste Management department’s data suggest that there are 3,084 commercial and residential establishments and each of them are producing more than 100 kg of wet waste daily and adding 1,345 metric tonne of garbage to the city’s total waste generation that is eventually sent to the three dumping grounds.

(Representational Image)

CHASING a September-end deadline set by the Bombay High Court, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has made it mandatory for more than 3,000 bulk generators of garbage to process their own waste, a plan expected to reduce the city’s waste generation by more than 1,000 metric tonne by the end of next month.

The BMC had sent fresh notice to commercial establishments and some residential complexes earlier this month and is hoping that the city’s wet waste will come down from the current daily average of 7,700 metric tonne to 6,241 metric tonne by end of October.

The Solid Waste Management department’s data suggest that there are 3,084 commercial and residential establishments and each of them are producing more than 100 kg of wet waste daily and adding 1,345 metric tonne of garbage to the city’s total waste generation that is eventually sent to the three dumping grounds. The BMC was pulled up by the Bombay High Court, after a fire at the Deonar dumping ground in January last year. It was given time till June 30 to come up with a consolidated solid waste management plan. The BMC was also supposed to discontinue dumping garbage in the grounds at Deonar, Kanjurmarg and Mulund.

Despite taking up several measures, including composting pits, the BMC was unable to meet the deadline and was

given an extension until September 30. Civic officials, however, said that they will not be able to meet the extended deadline as well.

Officials argued that there has been improvement over the past few months, which has dropped the amount of garbage by about 1000 metric tonne from the average quantity of waste recorded in January this year to be 8,722 metric tonne.

“We have already explained to the High Court that the waste-to-energy project at Deonar will take 40-45 months to be set up. The tendering process for the bio-mining project at Mulund dumping ground is underway and we are also planning to increase the capacity of the processing plant at Kanjur Marg. We are simultaneously taking a variety of steps to ensure that minimum amount of waste is taken to the dumping grounds and will present the progress report

in front of the High Court,” said an official.

Among the 24 administrative wards, while K West, which includes areas such as Andheri, Versova and Juhu, has 565 bulk generators producing 71 metric tonne of waste, R Central, which includes areas like Borivali, has 151 bulk generators that generate a much higher amount of waste daily — 350 metric tonne.

“Apart from hotels, gymkhanas and restaurants, we have also issued notices to building with flats measuring over 2,000 square feet to process their waste within their premises. They have time until October 1 to begin processing the waste after which, the BMC’s garbage trucks will no longer collect their wet waste,” said an official

from the Solid Waste Management department.

VIP 2 movie review: The phenomenon that is Dhanush rules hearts,"VIP 2 movie review: The sequel to Velai Illa Pattadhaari, this film has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivekh reprising their roles in addition to Kajol making a comeback in Kollywood. VIP 2 movie review: The sequel to Velai Illa Pattadhaari, this film has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivekh reprising their roles in addition to Kajol making a comeback in Kollywood.

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul, Vivekh

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie rating: 2.5 stars

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 aka VIP2 was one of the most awaited movies of the year. The sequel to Velai Illa Pattadhaari, this film has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivekh reprising their roles in addition to Kajol making a comeback in Kollywood after almost two decades. Directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth and penned by Dhanush himself, the film is all about Raghuvaran and how he deals with unemployment. The plot then proceeds to build around Raghuvaran’s company and him locking horns with corporate honcho of sorts, Vasundhara. All of this was already known before. It was, however, interesting to see how all of this translated on the silver screen.

Story:

The most important factor of any sequel is the continuity. Soundarya Rajinikanth and her team have done it beautifully. Tiny things like Raghuvaran’s pet and his tent office on the terrace, to the the big things like the VIP boys who supported him in Part 1 – the flow is almost flawless. Vasundhara’ s entry was stylish, every bit as arrogant as we expected and in a way, unsurprisingly impressive.

The massy elements, the entertaining song and dance numbers, stunts that are sure to impress Dhanush’s fans made up the rest of the plot elements. It made the usual conflict between an antagonist and his counterpart interesting. But in the end, the potential was lost. One must mention that the plot was an interesting try.

Screenplay and direction:

There is an art to screenplay and direction. Even commercial films have the potential to become a cult classic. VIP was one such film. Sadly, VIP 2 isn’t so. While everything was close to great, the fact that the film was stretched too much did make one anxious. Also, what is with the shots where we can’t see an actor as he performs?

Cast:

Dhanush is a star, and a performer who has won people over with his modesty and acting chops. He has done it again, and it is no surprise. Kajol, on the other hand, was spectacular in each frame. From her looks to the way she complimented Vasundhara, it did look like a part written for her. The only problem was the voice. At places, in the back of your mind, you have this irritation at the voice and the face not being a perfect match. Other than that, she got a rousing reception from the audience too. Amala Paul as the cranky and nagging wife plays her part well. Saranya Ponvannan’s appearance was unexpected and, in a way, nostalgic. Samuthirakani as the supportive and friendly father has done his part well.

Cinematography:

Sameer Thahir has done a sound job. Especially, the shots of Dhanush and Kajol locking horns is stunning in places. The style with which the scenes have been executed and edited is notable.

Music:

Sean Roldan is making a name for himself as a composer to look out for. Anirudh Ravichander’s BGM is unforgettable, and when we hear it at the beginning, the recall value reaches a different level. Sean Roldan’s music is beautiful, but will it ignite the same passion? After watching the film, it seems doubtful.

"Thousands of Mexicans march to scrap NAFTA, as government fights to save it","People chant during a protest against the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Mexico City, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (AP Photo/Gustavo Martinez Contreras) People chant during a protest against the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Mexico City, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017.

While Mexican government negotiators fought tooth and nail to save the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during talks in Washington, thousands of Mexican farmers and workers took to the streets on Wednesday demanding the deal be scrapped.

Carrying banners that read “No to the FTA,” and decorated with images of the distinctive hairstyles of US President Donald Trump and Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto, the protesters said the 1994 deal had devastated Mexican farms. “We are against the treaty and the renegotiation because it has not benefited the country,” said university union spokesperson Carlos Galindo, reflecting views widely held in the early years of the trade pact.

In a sign of that mistrust, on Jan. 1 1994 the Zapatista guerrilla army launched an armed uprising opposing free trade to mark the first day of NAFTA. The fervor has faded and most Mexicans, including leading leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who will run for president next year, now broadly support a deal which has led to job growth, especially in the auto manufacturing sector.

A recent poll found most Mexicans wanted to save NAFTA.

Mexico’s government is keen to maintain preferential access to the United States and Canada, where nearly 85 percent of its exports are shipped. However, much like in America’s rust belt, Mexico’s small, mainly indigenous farmers have not forgotten painful competition they blame on the free trade deal.

“The great loser in these last 23 years has been Mexico, above all, the small farmers,” said Ernesto Ladron de Guevara, speaking for one peasant farmers union at a park across from Mexico’s Foreign Ministry. His union is pushing for NAFTA’s fate to face a public vote, possibly to coincide with next year’s July presidential election and, if the deal survives, wants it to exclude anything related to agriculture and food production.

Mexico now imports some $18.5 billion of agriculture products every year, making it one of the most important markets for US farmers. That makes US rural states key supporters of the pact, making it harder for Trump to follow his declared instinct to rip it up in favor US blue-collar workers who feel jobs have flooded south.

While some Mexican agriculture such as large-scale livestock farms and horticulture has flourished under NAFTA, others, especially small scale grains producers, have found it hard to compete with US imports. “The effects of the treaty have been negative for the country’s indigenous people,” said Jose Narro Cespedes, a small farmers’ representative.

Other protesters emphasized that Mexico needs to pay attention to itself, rather than outside trade partners. “We need to focus on the internal economy,” said Galindo. “We’re a sweat-shop country, and the whole world knows it. The only thing we’re doing is exporting.”

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Super Meraj Sheykh raids Tamil Thalaivas, wins it for Dabang Delhi","Meraj Sheykh helped Dabadng Delhi beat Tamil Thalaivas. (Source: AP) Meraj Sheykh helped Dabadng Delhi beat Tamil Thalaivas. (Source: AP)

Dabang Delhi needed a miracle to complete their second win this season. Trailing 27-29 with a minute left in the match, Delhi looked to their top raider Meraj Sheykh. The onus was on the Iranian to pull off something sensational and help his team. He did exactly that. A super raid in the last minute turned the game around and gave Delhi three points. From the brink of defeat, Delhi made a dramatic comeback to beat Tamil Thalaivas 30-29 in a contest that was dominated by the team from Chennai, only the final minute.

“We wanted one win and I’m sure this will give us confidence,” Delhi coach Ramesh said. “Meraj was under pressure and consulted me if he should send Abolfazl to raid. But I insisted him to make the raid. Eventually, he got us three crucial points. Nobody had thought of that.”

Meraj carried the load for Delhi from the word go. However, he only got support from fellow countryman Abolfazl. Abolfazl, who was brought in replacing Viraj Vishnu Landge, scored a super 10. His back to back four successful raids kept the scoreline tight and didn’t let Tamil Thalaivas extend their lead. Calling it a blunder, Tamil captain Ajay said, “Our defence made a lot of mistakes. In spite of points coming in raids, we never got support from the defence.”

While Ajay Thakur looked in fine form and scored points with ease, the Iranian duo kept their nerves tight. After being criticised by coach K Baskaran, Ajay proved his mettle by scoring 13 points from 25 raids. As Ajay did the most of the job for his side, Delhi’s defence didn’t let the pressure build on Meraj and Abolfazl.

Tamil coach Baskaran was upset with the way his team gave away three points in the penultimate minute. “We didn’t expect Meraj scoring three points. Our strategy was to give one point. Despite having the lead, it was a foolish move from our defenders,” he concluded.

The song that’s India: Revisiting Desh Raag,"(From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. (From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain.

On the morning of August 15, 1989, India woke up to Desh raag, a celebration of the nation through classical music and dance. India, with its newly acquired colour television sets, watched as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi invoked Desh, a soothing late evening raga associated with the monsoons and the Indian national song — Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s Vande Mataram.

Set against a waterfall and majestic mountains, we saw a solemn looking Joshi sing Lab pe jaage geet aisa, Goonje bankar des raag in his sonorous voice to the sounds of a tabla and tanpura. His verses were followed by the doleful strains of a sarangi played by Pt Ram Narayan. There was also sitar maestro Pt Ravi Shankar strumming the seven sitar strings with exuberance, Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia breathing life into a reed, Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma playing the santoor, M Balamuralikrishna playing the violin and singing Baje sargam in Tamil, and, the famed tabla dual between Ustad Allah Rakha and Zakir Hussain, with the tricolour as the background — all inseparable elements of Desh raag.

The orchestral masterpiece also showcased various classical dance forms through short pieces: Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan danced at Fatehpur Sikri followed by Protima Bedi presenting Odissi on Juhu beach, Mallika Sarabhai giving a glimpse of Bharatanatyam, Kanak Rele presenting Mohiniattam and Swapna Sundari dancing the Kuchipudi.

This was India through sound and video, a glimpse into its rich and diverse cultural fabric. “It was also education. Telling the people about one of India’s most significant pillars — the classical arts,” says Narayan.

Conceptualised by Suresh Mullick, creative director of Ogilvy back then, and directed by Kailash Surendranath for Lok Sewa Sanchar Parishad, the piece was commissioned by the Rajiv Gandhi government “to raise the morale of people in a pre-liberalised India”. It was the third and final piece in a trilogy of short films; the other two being Freedom Run — The Torch Song and Mile sur mera tumhara. “Most of the credit goes to the fine performances of these classical heavyweights and Suresh Mullick who thought of the idea. It came when the economy was underdeveloped, the country was facing unrest and the people needed a unity in diversity message,” says Surendranath about the piece, which was composed mainly by Joshi. It was later put together by prominent jazz musician, Louis Banks. Mullick also got composer P Vaidyanathan and cinematographer RK Rao on board.

For lyrics, Mullick went to one of his own — Piyush Pande. “Baje sargam har taraf se, goonje bankar desh raag, said everything it had to. Suresh was my boss, and very particular. He said we should use analogies, and that people are smart enough to understand that we are talking of integration,” says Pande, now CEO, Ogilvy & Mather.

Surendranath, however, claims that Pandit Vinod Sharma (remembered for writing the popular Nirma advertisement) wrote the famed lines and that Pande didn’t. “Pandit Sharma was a dear associate and friend but he had nothing to do with the lyrics of the trilogy. Suresh is dead now and people want to create some or the other controversy over the piece, but all his old interviews, in great detail, talk about the process of writing both Mile sur and Desh raag and how he had commissioned them to me,” says Pande.

The process of completing the short film took over a month. Long fax messages were constantly exchanged between Banks and Mullick. Cinematographer Rao travelled across the country to shoot the film. “It was the simplicity that worked,” says Rao about the video that quite possibly helped many to grasp that Kathakali and Manipuri were classical art forms and not folk dances.

While Mile sur was about seven minutes long, Desh raag exceeded 13 minutes. Brilliant and technically sound as the piece was, Desh raag found more acceptance in the art circles as compared to the masses. “There hasn’t been a better musical genius than Suresh. But in hindsight, I think he went a little overboard. When the artiste in you gets too involved, that can happen. His artistic leanings resulted in the length becoming a problem. We loved those pieces by the artistes so much that we got carried away and got lost in its brilliance. It’s so beautiful and became extremely popular but not as much as Mile sur,” says Pande about the piece for which no artiste charged any fee.

The final lines of the national anthem were included towards the end of the film and that proved to be an impediment. “The authorities did not like our inclusion of the last bit of the national anthem — an incomplete anthem was considered inappropriate. But we managed to show it to Rajivji who loved it. He did not want anything changed,” says Surendranath.

Days after insolvency plea: Jaypee investors can submit claim by August 24,"Last week, panic broke out among those who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects after the insolvency plea. Express photo Last week, panic broke out among those who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects after the insolvency plea. Express photo

In an effort to reach out to home buyers who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects in Noida and Greater Noida, formats for submission of their claims have been made public on the company’s website. Three formats — for operational creditors, financial creditors, workmen and employees — are on the website and the deadline for submitting them is August 24.

Last week, panic broke out among home investors after IDBI filed an insolvency plea in the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), stating that the company had defaulted on a loan of Rs 526 crore. The NCLT appointed an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) to look into the issue.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Wednesday also expressed sympathy with the agitating home buyers and maintained that all those who had invested in the projects should get their flats.

Replying to a query on the issue, Jaitley said, “Those who are aggrieved can get remedy under this law (the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). If there is any such move, the government’s full sympathy is with those who have paid money and have rights on the flats.” An official statement from Anuj Jain, the IRP, said: “The claim is required to be filed in the requisite format as prescribed by IBC, and the regulations framed thereunder. The requisite format of all the above forms will be placed on the website of the company on Monday, August 14, 2017, and can be downloaded from there. The last date for submitting the claims is August 24, 2017.”

Explaining the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), Jain maintained that in the following days, “necessary information to prepare an information memorandum of the company” will be collected. “I will prepare a list of creditors of the company and their claims. For this purpose, a public announcement has already been made in two newspapers on August 12, 2017 inviting claims from creditors, including the flat owners of the company,” Jain’s statement read.

He added that the entire process of coming up with a resolution plan is likely to be submitted before the NCLT within 180 days. Maintaining that the CIRP was not a liquidation proceeding, but rather “a resolution for the current situation”, the statement read: “I am conscious of the interest of key stakeholders including flat owners.”

Borussia Dortmund winger Andre Schuerrle will miss the start of the Bundesliga season later this week after being ruled out for around a month with a thigh muscle injury, the German club said on Wednesday.

The 2014 World Cup winner has just returned from another injury layoff and played an hour after starting in Dortmund’s German Cup first round match against Rielasingen-Arlen on Saturday.

“He will have to take a break for about four weeks,” the club said in a statement. It was not clear when the player was injured but he is also likely to be ruled out of selection for Germany’s 2018 World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic in Prague on Sept. 1 and Norway in Stuttgart on Sept. 4.

Dortmund, who finished third in the Bundesliga last season, have qualified for the Champions League group stage and open their domestic league campaign at VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday.

Why Scams are Here to Say: Understanding Political Corruption in India

Author: N Ram

Publisher: Aleph Book Company

202 pages

Following demonetisation 2016, there has been heightened public interest in the black economy and corruption in India. The public thinks of scams as the big cases of corruption involving the high and mighty political and business leaders. The book under review largely analyses this linkage in both theoretical terms and with reference to some specific cases. The definitional aspects, links with media and the executive are explored.

The book comprises three sections divided into eight chapters. There is an introduction and a long conclusion where the author discusses what can be done. Section I, consisting of three chapters, presents the “story of corruption in India”. Section II provides the context by focussing on “historical, conceptual and theoretical issues”. Chapter 6 presents the author’s understanding, based on the Marxist view of political corruption, which is seen as an alternative to mainstream approaches. He critiques the “overly simplified moral” view underlying the “failed” JP and Anna Hazare movements.

Section III presents two important case studies which the author had directly dealt with, which give insights into the links between scams and politics in India. These two scams are Bofors and J Jayalaithaa’s disproportionate assets case. He hypothesises that “several Indian states have their own corruption systems”. So, there is a need for focussed empirical research to help find ways to combat corruption. The author states that the problem has become intractable without a change in India’s political economy. In the conclusion, he nonetheless presents suggestions under nine broad headings — “laws, enforcement capacity, policies, institutions, regulation, vigilance, corporate sector, journalism and politics”.

The author describes the “grand corruption that operates year-round with clockwork, “scientific precision.” However, this is true of most black income generation (and not just big corruption) and that is why in the literature it has been called “systemic and systematic”. The book points out that it is the joint product of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. In the literature, it has been called the “triad” and dismantling it is crucial to tackling black economy and corruption. This requires accountability, especially of the political class. While RTI can help in this, it is the public that has to act by not electing the corrupt. But, the public often has little choice since political parties put up the corrupt and the criminal in the belief that they can deliver.

In Chapter 3 and the conclusion, flawed laws and their weak enforcement are discussed. The author veers to the view that the government is overburdened compared to other countries. But, laws are laws in letter and spirit. If the spirit is weak, then howsoever good a law maybe, it can be circumvented by clever people to their advantage. That has been India’s experience, whether we think of the anti-defection laws, election financing law or the Income Tax Act.

The book misses the impact of corruption/scams on society — it leads to policy failure and to inefficiencies, which lower the rate of growth of the economy below its potential. In addition, it results in “social waste” so that welfare associated with growth diminishes. Consequently, even when incomes rise, poverty does not decline and inequality rises.

The book presents the historical context of corruption in India and mentions the idea of “Asiatic Corruption”. The author points out that the real scandal of the Empire was the loot of India and that was the bigger corruption. The idea that India was a corrupt country before British rule needs to be revisited. Corruption needs to be defined in relation to the laws of the land. If paying money to state officials for work to be done is customary or when the empire of a vanquished king is usurped by the victor, can it be called corruption? There is a fine line between legality and illegality, and this line shifts with changes in laws and the social understanding prevailing at that point of time.

In India, if the black economy is taken as a measure of the level of corruption, the size has grown from 4-5 per cent in 1955-56 to the present 62 per cent of GDP. If one extrapolates back, the level of corruption during colonial rule was low largely because most people had little to do with the state, which was small in size. Since the 1950s, the number of major scams in the country has been exploding in both number and the amount of money involved (See my Indian Economy since Independence: Persisting Colonial Disruption).

The book highlights the role of the private sector, especially MNCs (in spite of rules in advanced countries). In conclusion, the author says that “it would be irresponsible for citizens to stand aside”. The implication is clear: movements are crucial to the battle against corruption.

Mourners will gather in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Wednesday to honor the woman who was killed when a car rammed into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally that descended into violence last weekend. A memorial service for Heather Heyer is scheduled Wednesday morning at a downtown Charlottesville theater. Attendees were asked to wear purple, Heyer’s favorite colour, in her memory.

The 32-year-old was a Charlottesville resident and legal assistant whose mother described her daughter as a courageous, principled woman and firm believer in justice and equality. Heyer was among the hundreds of protesters who had gathered Saturday in Charlottesville to decry what was believed to be the largest gathering of white supremacists in a decade including neo-Nazis, skinheads and Ku Klux Klan members. They descended on the city for a rally prompted by the city’s decision to remove a Confederate monument.

Chaos and violence erupted before the event even began, with counter-demonstrators and rally-goers clashing in the streets. Authorities forced the crowd to disperse, and groups then began roaming through town. Counter-protesters had converged for a march along a downtown street when suddenly a Dodge Challenger barreled into them, hurling people into the air. Video shows the car reversing and hitting more people.

The Ohio man who police say was driving, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., was described by a former high school teacher as an admirer of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. He was quickly taken into custody and has been charged with second-degree murder and other counts. Heyer grew up in nearby Greene County and worked as a legal assistant at a law firm. Her boss, Larry Miller, said the young woman was active in the firm’s bankruptcy practice and was like a family member to him.

“She’s very compassionate, she’s very precise, got a big heart, she wants to make sure that things are right. She cares about the people that we take care of. She’s just a great person,” Miller said. Her mother, Susan Bro, said she would prefer to grieve in private but felt compelled to try to follow her daughter’s example.

“I miss her so, so much, but I’m going to make her death worth something,” Susan Bro told The Associated Press. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said this week that his department is working with Heyer’s family to ensure the safety of those at vigils and other memorials.

The Paramount Theater, which is hosting the vigil, said in a statement that it had made arrangements for overflow attendees to view the service through a livestream. Also killed Saturday were two Virginia State Police troopers who were aboard a helicopter that was providing video of Saturday’s event before it broke off to lend support to a motorcade for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The helicopter crashed outside of Charlottesville. An investigation into the crash is ongoing. A funeral for Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates has been set for Friday and a funeral for Lt. H. Jay Cullen, the helicopter’s pilot, is scheduled for Saturday.

A total of 2,042 mascot designs have been received for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after a competition launched earlier this month invited Japanese residents to submit their proposals, Games organisers said on Tuesday.

According to the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, a quarter of the total applicants were in their teens or 20s, while almost half of the submissions were received from people aged 30 to 49.

There were 1,774 individual submissions and 268 group submissions, while several entries were created as a part of elementary school club projects. “Given the difficult conditions attached to the submissions, the number received was a satisfactory figure,” the organisers said in a statement.

“The judging process will begin on Aug. 22, with the process going until the field is narrowed down to three or four final candidates. “Elementary school classes nationwide will vote on the final candidates from Dec. 11 to Jan. 19, with the final mascot selection expected to be announced at the beginning of February.”

Gujarat: 17 held for assault on Dalit family for skinning dead cattle,"Shailesh at his home at Kasor village in Anand. Express photo by Bhupendra Rana Shailesh at his home at Kasor village in Anand. Express photo by Bhupendra Rana

Four days after a mob of Darbar (Kshatriya) community allegedly attacked a Dalit family over skinning of cattle carcass at Kasor village in Anand district of Gujarat, police on Wednesday arrested all the 17 accused. Though there was no visible sign of tension in the village, a police team, armed with tear gas riot control vehicle, has been stationed outside the road that leads to the Dalit settlement of the village since Saturday.

Outside his modest home, 21-year-old Shailesh Rohit, who and his mother were attacked by the mob, had made seating arrangement for the stream of visitors pouring into his house since the incident came to light last weekend.

“From police to the media, from politicians to locals, to those wanting to mediate in the case, everyone has been here,” said a member of his community.

According to the police, the mob attacked Shailesh and his mother because he was skinning the animal close to the village crematorium. Shailesh, however, rejected the police claim.

“I had not even started skinning the animal when the mob attacked us,” said Shailesh as he recounted the incident.

“On Friday, I received a call from my client, informing me that his bovine had died and he wanted me to collect the carcass. I hired a tractor, as usual, and brought the carcass to the village. Since the approach road to the land allotted to us for skinning cattle is submerged in water and not usable, I took the carcasss to an open ground in the village which is near the crematorium. On the way, the sarpanch saw me and told me not to skin the animal there. I complied and brought the carcass to the ground behind our settlement,” said Shailesh.

“But the next day, a mob of around 15 people arrived at our colony looking for me. My mother was talking to neighbours when they asked her my address. When she told them that I am her son, they began to abuse her. Hearing the commotion, I came outside. That is when they attacked us. My mother has sustained injuries in her stomach and is traumatised by the attack,” added Shailesh, who lives with his ailing father, brother and sister-in-law. At present, Shailesh’s mother is undergoing treatment at Petlad civil hospital.

Pointing to the approach road to the allotted plot to skin the animal, Shailesh said: “What you see of the road today is after the so-called repair work done by the administration. Officials came today afternoon and threw mud over the slush that had made it difficult to bring the cattle here on Thursday.”

According to Shailesh, the 40-odd Dalit families in the village had never witnessed such an incident. “I have been skinning dead cattle since I was 15. This is the first time I have been attacked. So far, I have only heard about such incidents and felt the hostility (from the other community), but never been harmed,” said Shailesh, who also works as a daily wage labourer.

Members of his community said that this was the first time that peace has been breached between the two communities in the village. “This incident has shocked us. There was no history of enmity between the communities, nor was there any provocation. Our settlements are clearly divided. On a regular day, we face no visible discrimination. Children of both the communities study together in the government school here. But, we have been unable to understand why Shailesh’s family was attacked,” said Manish Rohit.

Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police (Anand) Saurabh Singh said that the arrested accused will be produced in the court on Thursday. All those who have been arrested for the assault, barring one, are in their 20s.

Voices of Partition: One UP Muslim and two Pakistan born Hindus recollect the horrors of 1947,"From left Kulsum Naqvi, Balram Rana and Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo) From left Kulsum Naqvi, Balram Rana and Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo)

“Hindustan had become free. Pakistan had become independent soon after its inception but man was still slave in both these countries — slave of prejudice … slave of religious fanaticism … slave of barbarity and inhumanity.”- Saadat Hasan Manto

At the stroke of the midnight hour when the world slept, India awoke to life and freedom…..she also awoke to deaths and massacre, abductions, deceit, fear and displacement. The partition of Punjab remains by far the bloodiest part of Indian history, the dirtiest and scariest of all, tagging along as it did with the euphoria of freedom. A UP Muslim and two Hindu immigrants from Punjab narrated to Indianexpress.com their memories of August 15, 1947.

Kulsum Naqvi: We thought our brothers were dead

Kulsum Naqvi (Express Photo) Kulsum Naqvi (Express Photo)

Kulsum Naqvi (82) was born in a conservative Muslim household in a small village of Moradabad district in Uttar Pradesh. Daughter of a wealthy zamindar, Naqvi had grown up with every kind of luxury at her disposal. The departure of the British, however, had stripped her family of all its wealth. She recounts her childhood days when the Hindu-Muslim riots had torn apart her family.

“I had a beautiful childhood. We had a large house, almost like a haveli. My father was a zamindar and he owned a number of villages. We had a large number of servants in our house and they would manage everything. But ours was also a conservative Muslim family. We wore the burkha whenever we went out and were forbidden from being among men.

There were a large number of Hindus in my childhood village. I had lots of Hindu friends. Back then we never thought about who was a Hindu and who a Muslim. I remember during Holi, my friends would come to our house and drag me out and we would play Holi all day long. Similarly, during Id, my Hindu friends would join in the celebrations as well.

When the country got free we had a lot of celebrations in our village. Slogans were raised and crackers were burst. However, independence had come at a huge cost for us.

After the English left, however, we felt a huge change in our lives. All of a sudden we became poor. All the land owned by my father was acquired by the Indian government and we were left with nothing. My father was very unhappy about this. Later, the government had offered him a part of land as compensation but my father refused that as well out of anger. However, despite all the loss we went through my father was determined that he won’t leave India.

Partition had not led to any riots in our village. Both Hindus and Muslims had treated each other very well. There were a few mob attacks and slogans of ‘Jai Ram’, and ‘Jai Shankar’ would be raised. But the Hindu families around our house had given us a lot of support. They had ensured that nothing happen to us and that we need not leave.

However, my two brothers were working in Bareilly back then. The riots there resulted in them fleeing to Pakistan. We did not even know that they had fled to Pakistan. My father just assumed they had died in the riots. The grief of their presumed death had resulted in my father losing his memory. It is only after eight to ten years that they contacted us from Pakistan and that is when we got to know they were still alive. By then my father had in fact married off one of my brother’s wife who was with us, under the assumption that his son had died.

They later told us about the ordeal they went through while migrating. They told us that while both of them had left together, they somehow got separated. One went off to Karachi and the other one to Dhaka in East Pakistan. My brother described to me how there was absolutely no police protection in the train and how scared they were for their lives. No food and water was available either.

One of my elder sisters was also in Bareilly at this time. She too fled to Lahore in Pakistan during the riots. But she got in touch with us sooner than my brothers. She had later told me that she was asked to remove her burkha while travelling due to fear of being attacked. This was the first time she had stepped out without a burkha.

I visited my brothers in Pakistan in 1977. But I was very uncomfortable there. First of all people would laugh at our language. Then they would often accuse us of treachery because we did not leave India during Partition. We did not like the treatment and so we left earlier than decided.”

Salochana Sehgal: We would take shelter in houses of Muslim neighbours

Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo) Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo)

A South Delhi resident, Salochana Sehgal was an 11-year-old girl when the country attained independence. Having grown up with a large number of Muslim friends in her neighbourhood, she was forced to move to India a few days before independence due to the riots there. She recollects about her days of living in fear and the horrific sights she saw on her way to India.

“I was born in Kohat in West Pakistan. My father was a judge there. While growing up I had a number of Muslim friends. I remember Naseem, she was a very close friend of mine. In fact her father had helped us leave Kohat. He was the one who made all the arrangements and got my elder sister and my mother a burkha to wear during our travel. I was very young so I did not have to wear a burkha. But once we left Kohat I never kept in touch with Naseem. I used to miss her a lot though. But we used to get news of so many riots and houses burning and that used to scare us a lot. There was no question of writing to her after that.

When the riots first started taking place in Kohat there was so much of violence and destruction all around. Our house was amidst the houses of Muslims. So whenever the attacks took place we would go to the houses of the Muslims. There was no fear of getting burnt down there. So during the nights then come back to our home in the morning. The Muslims used to give us a lot of support. They were our friends. They kept telling us that we should not worry.

In our village we would hear so many cases of women being abducted and raped. Parents would be so scared. Some of them would be killed with poison so as to save them from getting raped.

We came out of Kohat about a month before Independence. A bus was arranged for us and some people were also arranged for our protection. We just came in our clothes and did not get anything else with us. Later, when we travelled in train, we saw such horrific scenes of people suffering and dying. So many pregnant women would give birth to their babies on the platform itself without any facilities.

We first reached Hoshiarpur in Punjab. My father had stayed back in Kohat since he was a judge and could not leave. For a long time we knew nothing about the whereabouts of my father. My mother used to remain very anxious. She would observe fasts for days, praying for news of him. Many days later a girl in our neighbourhood came to us saying that my father had been given a job in Delhi and that is how we got to know.

Once my father joined us we all left for Delhi and have been living here since then.”

Balram Rana: I regret not being able to save my family

Balram Rana (Express Photo) Balram Rana (Express Photo)

An Ayurveda specialist, 105-year-old Balram Rana was born in Nupursethi village in present day Pakistan. During Partition Rana was a 35-year-old, practising medicine in Rawalpindi. Completely bed-ridden now, he recounts the anguish of losing his family members in the riots and the guilt of not being able to convince them to leave the village on time. His daughter on the other hand explains how he still spends sleepless nights crying about the family he lost in the riots.

“I had a large family while growing up and Hindus and Muslims had good relations among themselves in my village. But during the riots the same Muslims turned sour. My mother had a friend who was Muslim. She used to be so close to my mother. But during the attack she just turned her back on us.

I was in Rawalpindi when Partition was announced. My grandparents, parents and their brothers were all in our village when the riots broke out. I had been asking them to join me in Rawalpindi, but they refused to do so. There was a man called Man Singh in my village. He fooled everyone. He kept telling everyone that nothing will happen and people believed him.

When the attacks took place everyone who remained were killed. Man Singh was also killed and so was his uncle and sons. His sons were axed. My grandmother was thrown into a fire alive. So many of my uncles were killed. At that moment, whoever came in front of the Muslims were killed. Only the ones who could run away were saved.

I had one Muslim friend, Nazeer. He and his family would always tell us that they would help our family in times of need. When the attacks took place he asked my parents to hide in their house. That is how my mother, father and sister were saved. The others were all killed.

In Rawalpindi also riots had taken place in Kursibazaar, but I managed to get out of there well before time. I somehow managed to get help from a friend and got up on a train with my wife and her younger sister and reached Hardwar. I still keep thinking that had I been in my village that day even I would be killed.”

What they didn’t tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?” a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent — if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence — no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother’s 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn’t know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I’ve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I’d rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I’d rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we’d rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn’t come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn’t easy — especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra’s bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don’t just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those “buy-one-get-one-free” shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don’t want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you’ve been hoarding — and holding back — all your life.

And even when you do, it’s a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won’t have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you’ll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this — freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

Former Olympic cycling champion Samuel Sanchez fails dope test,"Samuel Sanchez’s team BMC Racing immediately announced his suspension. (Source: AP File) Samuel Sanchez’s team BMC Racing immediately announced his suspension. (Source: AP File)

Spain’s former Olympic champion Samuel Sanchez has been suspended with immediate effect after testing positive for banned growth hormones, cycling’s governing body said on Thursday.

Sanchez, 39, won the 2008 Olympic road race in Beijing and five individual stages in the Vuelta a Espana between 2005 and 2007 as well as an individual stage on the 2011 Tour de France. He will now miss this year’s Vuelta, which begins on Saturday in Nimes, France.

The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) said in a statement on its website that Sanchez had been notified of an “Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF) of GHRP-2*” from an out-of-competition test on Aug. 9.

“The rider has the right to request and attend the analysis of the B sample. In accordance with UCI Anti-Doping Rules, the rider has been provisionally suspended until the adjudication of the affair,” the UCI said.

GHRP-2 refers to GH-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs), which are classified as “Peptide Hormones, Growth Factors, Related Substances and Mimetics” on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s 2017 Prohibited List.

Sanchez’s team BMC Racing immediately announced his suspension and said he would be replaced by Loic Vliegen in the Vuelta.

“In accordance with BMC Racing Team’s zero tolerance policy and UCI regulation, Sanchez has been provisionally suspended with immediate effect,” BMC said in a statement.

“Until the results of the B sample are provided, no further action will be taken. All riders and staff are held to the highest ethical standard and BMC Racing Team is extremely disappointed to share this news on the eve of the Vuelta a Espana.”

"Aakash Chopra goes down memory lane, shares pic with teammates from 2004 Pakistan tour","India defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a three-match Test series in 2004. (Source: Twitter) India defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a three-match Test series in 2004. (Source: Twitter)

Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra went down memory lane and shared a picture from India’s tour of Pakistan in 2004 where the Sourav Ganguly-led side won first ever Test series on Pakistan soil and created history. Chopra on his Twitter shared the picture and wrote, “Down the memory lane….2004 #Pakistan”

The team that toured Pakistan in 2004 was playing under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and his troops created history after winning the three-match Test series 2-1. In the first match, India stamped authority when they put on a total of 675/5 before declaring in Multan. Though Ganguly wasn’t the part of this particular Test match but it didn’t really effect India’s performance. Riding on a record-breaking triple hundred from Virender Sehwag, India took good control of the game in the beginning itself. Indian bowlers then bundled out Pakistan for 407 and 216 respectively to win the match by an innings and 52 runs.

In the second match in Lahore, the home side did bounce back. They bowled out India for 287 in first innings while scored 489 in reply. In second innings too, India were all out for 241 and Pakistan chased down the target by 9 wickets to square the series.

But in the deciding third game, India put on a phenomenal show. Pakistan were bundled out for 224 in first innings and India in reply scored a mammoth total of 600 runs after Rahul Dravid scored career best 270. Indian bowlers then cleaned up Pakistan batting line up to win the match by an innings and 131 runs.

Earlier, India also won the five-match ODI series 3-2.

Sachin Tendulkar appeals for ‘Swachh’ and ‘Swasth Bharat’ on Independence Day,"In a tweet, he appealed for everyone to set a goal of achieving a “Swachh Bharat and a Swasth Bharat.” (Source: Reuters) In a tweet, he appealed for everyone to set a goal of achieving a “Swachh Bharat and a Swasth Bharat.” (Source: Reuters)

Batting great Sachin Tendulkar had a special message to give to the country on its 70th Independence Day. In a tweet, he appealed for everyone to set a goal of achieving a “Swachh Bharat and a Swasth Bharat.” He also asked everyone to “feel the pride” of being part of a “glorious nation” that has made “immense progress” in “nearly every field.”

“Namaste India! It’s a very proud day for all of us,” said Tendulkar, “As we celebrate 70 years of freedom, we can look back on the immense progress we have made in nearly every field. Feel the pride of being part of such a glorious nation. Today, let us set ourselves a goal for the years to come, moving forward together both as a Swachh Bharat as well as a Swasth Bharat. May the Indian tricolour always fly high…”

Apart from being arguably the greatest batsman ever to play the game, Tendulkar is also Rajya Sabha MP. He was recently the subject of many trolls when he made an appearance in the upper house, something that he hasn’t done too often since his appointment to it. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also wished India on the occasion of Independence Day. “Happy Independence Day India! No way to change neighbours, let’s work towards peace, tolerance and love. Let humanity prevail,” said Afridi. Afridi has been appealing for peace between Pakistan and India and used the opportunity on India’s Independence Day to do the same.

Robin Van Persie set for Dutch team recall,"Robin Van Persie in line for Netherlands recall. Robin Van Persie in line for Netherlands recall.

Robin van Persie is in line for a recall to the Netherlands national team after an absence of almost two years.

The Fenerbahce forward was named on Wednesday in a preliminary squad for two key World Cup qualifiers in the next fortnight.

Ryan Babel and Eljero Elia have also been recalled as coach Dick Advocaat named 32 players for the important qualifier against Group A leaders France in Paris on Aug. 31 and then at home to Bulgaria in Amsterdam on Sept. 3.

There is a first call-up for Ajax Amsterdam’s 20-year-old midfielder Donny van de Beek, who scored two in the early rounds of the Champions League over the last month.

The 34-year-old van Persie, whose 50 goals in 101 internationals makes him the the Netherlands’ top scorer, last played in a 3-2 loss to the Czech Republic in the European Championship qualifier in October 2015. He scored an own goal and was later dropped by Advocaat’s predecessor Danny Blind.

“I worked with him last season at Fenerbahce where he showed what he could do. Robin is a player we might still need but we’ll see in the next weeks how fit he is and if he is playing,” Advocaat said in a statement released by the Dutch football association.

“This is a preliminary squad so players can fall out or be included later.”

Besiktas striker Babel, 30, was last in the team in late 2011, while Elia, who also plays in Turkey, for Basaksehir, has not been in the team since 2012.

Advocaat was named in May to try and resurrect the Dutch’s hopes of qualifying for the next World Cup in Russia as they sit third in their group with 10 points from six games, three behind joint leaders France and Sweden.

"Melbourne most liveable city; Karachi, Dhaka among the least","Melbourne: The rating quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual’s lifestyle in any given location, and allows for direct comparison between locations. Melbourne: The rating quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual’s lifestyle in any given location, and allows for direct comparison between locations.

Melbourne is the most liveable city in the world, followed by Austrian capital, Vienna and Canada’s Vancouver in the second and third place respectively, reveals a survey.

According to the Global Liveability Report compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), no Indian city was ranked in the top ten or bottom ten in the most liveable city ranking.

Others in the 10 most liveable cities in the world include Toronto at the fourth place, followed by Calgary (5th), Adelaide (6th), Perth (7th), Auckland (8th), Helsinki (9th) and Hamburg (10th).

According to the survey that covered 140 cities globally, though the rankings of top five cities remain unchanged, the past few years have seen increasing instability across the world, causing volatility in the scores of many cities.

“While not a new phenomenon, the frequency and spread of terrorism have increased noticeably and become even more prominent,” the report said adding “repeated attacks in France and the UK have had a contagion effect, raising terror alerts and lowering stability scores in cities across the region”.

Besides, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Turkey remain the subject of high-profile civil unrest and armed conflicts, while a number of other countries, such as Nigeria, continue to battle insurgent groups.

“Even a relatively stable country such as the US has seen mounting civil unrest linked to the Black Lives Matter movement and the policies proposed by President Donald Trump,” it said.

EIU noted that overall, the global average liveability score has fallen 0.8 per cent to 74.8 per cent over the past five years.

As per the survey, the least liveable city was Damascus at 140th place, followed by Lagos (139), Tripoli (138), Dhaka (137), Port Moresby (136), Algiers (135), Karachi (134), Harare (133), Douala (132) and Kiev (131).

The rating quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual’s lifestyle in any given location, and allows for direct comparison between locations.

Every city is assigned a rating of relative comfort for over 30 qualitative and quantitative factors across five broad categories – stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

"Will always try to develop young players, says Stephen Constantine","Stephen Constantine with the team. (Source: Twitter) Stephen Constantine with the team. (Source: Twitter)

Ahead of the tri-nation series, India head coach Stephen Constantine said that as long as he is the coach, he will always try to develop youth players by giving them opportunities as the lifespan of a team is four to six years.

After selecting at least ten U-23 players for his side, Constantine said in an interview to aiff.com, “As long as I will be the coach, I will always try and develop youth players and give them opportunities. The lifespan of any team is around four to six years. When you are in the fourth year, you need to keep searching again – you need to look for change. So why not do it all the time.”

Having said that, the coach agreed that the experience of senior players is also important in a team. “Of course, you need the experience and need to learn from the senior players but that can sometimes lead us to a bit of stagnation. It’s extremely important for senior players to need to work hard to keep their positions as much it is important for the kids to learn to take their positions.”

“At the moment, I feel we have the right balance as even the young players have some 8-9 matches under their belt and you cannot call them inexperienced anymore.”

Constantine also revealed his mantra of selecting players. “Play the brand of football I want you to play and the door is open for you. When I see any player and from all levels, I just try to find out whether he can play the brand of Football which I want him to play. If you can, the door stays open for you.”

Donald Trump signs bill expanding college assistance for veterans,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law an updated veterans’ education bill that marks the largest expansion of college assistance for military veterans in a decade.

The Forever GI act immediately removed a 15-year time limit on the use of GI benefits. The measure also increases financial assistance for thousands serving in the National Guard and Reserve, building on a 2008 law that guaranteed veterans a full-ride scholarship to any in-state public university, or a similar cash amount to attend private colleges.

Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who joined Trump for the signing, said the new law also provides benefits to Purple Heart recipients whose injuries forced them to leave the service. Benefits can also now be transferred to the eligible dependent of service members who are killed in the line of duty.

Veterans would get additional payments for completing science, technology and engineering courses, part of a broad effort to better prepare veterans for life after active-duty service amid a fast-changing job market. The law also restores benefits if a college closes in the middle of the semester, a protection that was added after thousands of veterans were hurt by the collapse of for-profit college giant ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges.

“This is expanding our ability to support our veterans in getting education,” Shulkin told reporters at a briefing after Trump signed the measure at his New Jersey golf club upon returning there after two nights at his home at New York’s Trump Tower. Journalists were not permitted to watch Trump sign the bill, as the White House has done for earlier veterans’ legislation he has turned into law. That includes a measure Trump signed at the club Saturday to provide nearly $4 billion in emergency funding for a temporary veterans health care program.

Wednesday’s signing came the day after Trump was soundly rebuked for continuing to insist that “both sides” were culpable for an outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators. One woman was killed.

A wide range of veterans groups supported the education measure. The Veterans of Foreign Wars says hundreds of thousands stand to benefit.

Student Veterans of America says that only about half of the 200,000 service members who leave the military each year go on to enroll in college, while surveys indicate that veterans often outperform peers in the classroom.

“Taking care of our veterans includes empowering them with the opportunity to succeed,” said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. “We applaud President Trump for his continued dedication to helping veterans and support of meaningful reform.”

The expanded educational benefits would be paid for by bringing living stipend payments under the GI Bill down to a similar level as that received by an active-duty member, whose payments were reduced in 2014 by 1 percent a year for five years. Total government spending on the GI Bill is expected to be more than $100 billion over 10 years.

Iran could quit nuclear deal in “hours” if new U.S. sanctions imposed: Hassan Rouhani,"Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani (AP/File) Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani (AP/File)

Iran could abandon its nuclear agreement with world powers “within hours” if the United States imposes any more new sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday. “If America wants to go back to the experience (of imposing sanctions), Iran would certainly return in a short time — not a week or a month but within hours — to conditions more advanced than before the start of negotiations,” Rouhani told a session of parliament broadcast live on state television.

Iran says new sanctions that the United States has imposed on it breach the agreememt it reached in 2015 with the United States, Russia, China and three European powers in which it agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most sanctions. The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on six Iranian firms in late July for their role in the development of a ballistic missile programme after Tehran launched a rocket capable of putting a satellite into orbit.

In early August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law new sanctions on Iran, Russia and North Korea passed by the U.S. Congress. The sanctions in that bill also target Iran’s missile programmes as well as human rights abuses. The United States imposed unilateral sanctions after saying Iran’s ballistic missile tests violated a U.N. resolution, which endorsed the nuclear deal and called upon Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such technology.

It stopped short of explicitly barring such activity. Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons. “The world has clearly seen that under Trump, America has ignored international agreements and, in addition to undermining the (nuclear deal), has broken its word on the Paris agreement and the Cuba accord…and that the United States is not a good partner or a reliable negotiator,” Rouhani said. Trump said last week he did not believe that Iran was living up to the spirit of the nuclear deal.

"Minister Vijay Goel’s NGO asks for plot for toy bank, DDA changes norms, layout plan to allot","Asked why VAES sought a plot originally earmarked for government use and if he was aware that the layout plan had been changed to allot the land, Vijay Goel, in an email, said the VAES would respond. (Source: Express Photo/Prem Nath Pandey) Asked why VAES sought a plot originally earmarked for government use and if he was aware that the layout plan had been changed to allot the land, Vijay Goel, in an email, said the VAES would respond. (Source: Express Photo/Prem Nath Pandey)

Dismissing objections raised by its own officials, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) changed its layout plan to allot a plot in the capital earmarked for a post office to an NGO closely associated with Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel in September 2016. In fact, Goel’s NGO kept asking for the plot, adjacent to a school it runs. And at one point, it openly upbraided the DDA for seeking documents.

In January 2014, soon after Goel became a Rajya Sabha member, Vaish Aggarwal Educational Society (VAES) — DDA records mention Goel as vice-president, son Siddhant and daughter Vidyun among members — sought land from the DDA to set up a toy bank.

Records scrutinised by The Indian Express show that a month later, DDA asked VAES to apply “on prescribed form”. Nothing moved for more than a year. However, the next year, on June 2015, VAES sent another letter which was acknowledged by DDA Additional Director (Institutional Land) in a file noting: “Pls process immediately”. On August 7, the DDA officially recorded the application on prescribed form.

Records show that between October 9 and 14 in 2015, DDA officers, processing the VAES file, put down on record that “there is no approved site available” and that “as per the provisions of Delhi’s Master Plan 2021, there is no User premise nomenclature as ‘toy bank-cum-playing centre and social activities for underprivileged children’.”

Within days, on October 16, DDA’s then Principal Commissioner (Land Distribution) J P Agrawal cleared the proposal for consideration. The approval, according to records, was given “considering the aim/objective of the society.”

DDA found a way around the objection that a toy bank didn’t fall in any prescribed category by categorising it as “orphaned/children centre.” As for non-availability of plot in the layout plan (LOP), DDA said: …”It may be considered to carve out a plot by making change in Zonal Plan/LOP from the available land, if admissible/available by Planning Department… suitable plot. may be identified and indicated along with LOP thereof for considering the matter further”.

Incidentally, at the same meeting where they eventually cleared the VAES application, DDA rejected an application for land from INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) on the ground that its purpose — setting up an INTACH academy — was “not covered under socio-cultural category.”

On December 23, 2015, a DDA file noting recorded that the 488-sq m plot “suggested” by VAES was visited by DDA officials. “Situated in Derawal Nagar, GT Road Delhi. the site under reference is maintained as a park where one side is adjoining to Adharsheela nursery school (run by VAES). (and) is earmarked for post office in the layout plan,” it said, asking the official concerned “to confirm/verify whether any correspondence has been sent to postal department”.

The plot for the toy bank The plot for the toy bank

Subsequent file notings show that this plot was recommended for temple construction as one of 291 cases cleared at a meeting in February 2003. These allotments were put on hold pending investigation.

On January 15, 2016, a DDA official proposed that the change in layout plan to accommodate VAES request “be considered if the land is to be allotted for toy bank” and sought in-principle approval so that the application can be formally processed. Agrawal gave his approval on January 22, 2016.

The DDA’s Institutional Allotment Committee (IAC) recommended the toy bank proposal subject to a formal/valid sponsorship on May 5, 2016, while it “deferred” seven other applications on the same ground and rejected one for not furnishing sponsorship at all.

Instead of asking the VAES to provide a valid sponsorship letter, the DDA requested the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development to “consider the application” and furnish “sponsorship/recommendation for allotment of land” in the prescribed format, adding that “this may please be treated as urgent”.

But the NGO was not impressed. The VAES wrote to the DDA that it failed “to understand that why you (DDA) are sending us again and again for the same thing” and “we think it (document already furnished) will fulfil all your requirement”.

The IAC meeting on July 8 cleared the allotment subject to approval of the layout plan by the screening committee of the DDA’s Planning Department. On July 18, Agrawal sought approval of the Lt Governor, also the DDA chairman, and the “competent authority” cleared the file on July 26.

The screening committee sanctioned the layout plan modification on August 8. The plot was allotted to VAES on September 1, 2016 and it made a payment of Rs 1.77 crore on October 19, 2016.

This allotment was the only disposal of institutional land under the socio-cultural category by the DDA in the last two years.

Goel-linked NGO upbraids DDA when it is asked for records. Goel-linked NGO upbraids DDA when it is asked for records.

Asked if there was any precedent of modifying a layout plan to allot a plot earmarked for government use to a private party, Agrawal said he handed over charge of the land disposal division in July 2017 and would not be able to comment.

While Agrawal’s successor, Rajeev Verma, did not respond to phone calls and emails from The Indian Express, Commissioner (Planning) Sabyasachi Dass said: “Post offices are becoming obsolete and now serve only as savings outlets. Probably that’s the reason why the LOP (layout plan) was changed to allot that plot to a society.”

Najeeb Jung, the then Lt Governor, said he could not “recall” the allotment.

Asked why VAES sought a plot originally earmarked for government use and if he was aware that the layout plan had been changed to allot the land, Goel, in an email, said the VAES would respond. VAES secretary general Sandeep Garg said these questions “can be answered best by the allotting authority i.e. DDA.”

“If the land was earmarked for post office, it is clear that post office was still not made there for at least 20 years and it seems there was no plan of DDA to use it for that purpose. All procedures for allotment of land by DDA were followed in this case. The land has been allotted for toy bank-cum-play centre which is catering to underprivileged children including orphans, differently-abled kids, poorest children etc. DDA by allotting land has in fact participated in this noble cause,” Garg said in an email.

Stating that the minister was being dragged “into the matter unnecessarily”, Garg wrote that Goel “is neither an active member of the VAES society nor has been its Vice-President for many years”. DDA records of the August 2015 application for land show otherwise.

According to the VAES, the Toy Bank collects used and unused toys from different sources, restores them and distributes them among needy children. A not-for-profit organisation, the Toy Bank has recycled more than 500,000 toys over 15 years.

Protesters denounce Donald Trump’s first presidential New York home visit,"US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo)

Several hundred angry protesters demonstrated outside Trump Tower in New York, denouncing US President Donald Trump before his first visit to his Manhattan residence since taking office more than six months ago. After making a brief stop at the White House, the Republican commander-in-chief is scheduled to spend several days in his Manhattan triplex before returning to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey to finish out his first summer vacation as president.

But in the predominantly Democratic-voting US financial capital, where Trump is hugely unpopular, several hundred protesters descended on Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue until police could clear the sidewalks.

“Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Trump the racist has to go!” sang the crowd, some holding up giant balloon letters in gold that read: FU TRUMP.”

“No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!” the group changed. “Love, not hate. That’s what makes America great!”

Dozens of officers stood guard for several blocks. Police detained at least one woman protesting outside the Prada store, as angry demonstrators rounded on those in uniform shouting: “Who do you serve?”

“I am terrified of what country we’ve become, the fact that white supremacists, Nazis, anti-Semites feel empowered by our president,” said Lynn Gray, 68, who left banking to found her own company.

“He’s destroying everything that our forefathers worked for.”

Teacher Kevin Gallagher, 61, said he at first gave Trump “a chance” despite his dislike of the Republican.

“But this week has been truly the lowest of his presidency,” Gallagher added. “He needs to see what his fellow citizens think of him.”

Trump took heat from Democrats and Republicans alike for his initial, subdued response to a deadly weekend rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Under pressure to explicitly condemn the violence, Trump earlier yesterday denounced racism and slammed the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as “criminals and thugs.”

“I came here to be with the people of New York and express our anger,” said musician, Ryan Egan, 28, in jeans and a grey T-shirt, who clapped and shouted with the other protesters.

Trump previously visited New York in May, for just a few hours, when he dined with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on a decommissioned US warship docked on the Hudson River.

The president often says he’s not spending much time in New York to avoid paralyzing the city.

“During the time that I lived in Manhattan, whenever a president came in, it was very disruptive, and I think I’m probably more disruptive than any of them,” he said recently.

Located on Fifth Avenue, Trump Tower houses offices, apartments and the headquarters of the Trump Organization, as well the president’s triplex New York residence at the top of the 68-floor glass tower.

It was in the tower’s marble lobby that the billionaire real estate developer launched his candidacy for the presidency on June 16, 2015.

Would you like to be matched at work?,"Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

“I want to do fraandship with you…” is something every woman has heard, being randomly accosted on the road, and yes, that has now translated online, to not just Facebook and other social networking sites, but also the professional LinkedIn. While I’m usually careful about avoiding “friendship requests” from people I don’t know on Facebook, I’m not that reticent on LinkedIn, since it’s a site where professionals pursue career goals. But, I’ve had to un-connect after receiving “friendship requests” in my mailbox marked to “My dear…”.

So, when a new matrimonial app decides to pitch itself as the perfect playing ground for dating with a purpose, using the professional networking site as its database, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it would weed out the Romeos. Promatch, playing cupid to ambitious careerists, claims to be a notch above the typical dating apps, which are used for “flirting” and “casual relationships”, among other things. Promatch, on the other hand, since it has LinkedIn verified profiles, effectively points you towards mates who are (hopefully!) “focused towards a serious relationship” and get this—you can search in same industry, match your incomes and city.

First off, hookups happen everywhere, whether it’s at work or elsewhere. It’s the same people, after all, whether you meet at a bar, through common friends or at work, with or without an app. Potential partners can’t grow a sincerity gene, just because you happen to be a ‘pro’ match. But, what’s commendable is the clear-headed approach it takes to matrimony, something Indians are famous for. While it’s fine to kiss all the frogs you like, make your “mistakes” before you find your Prince Charming or the woman of your dreams, when it comes to marriage, there’s a very decided checklist, which puts the earning capacity of a spouse right on top. And, conventionally, parents have looked for a doctor for their doctor son or daughter and other similar matches. And, while such an app may sound like fun, it’s not really, since it’s similar to the “bio-data” that gets sent around to relatives and all those who reach out, listing educational qualifications, even parents’ and relatives’ career progression, if someone is well-placed in a government job, etc. It’s all laid out, bare bones, without any pretensions. In this generation, where we act all this doesn’t matter and we’re one better than our parents, such an app calls out our innate…well, “Indian-ness”. Will the guy understand my hours? Can he support me if I take a break after a baby? Will the woman be able to equally pitch in for my dream home EMIs? Well, let’s face it, we’re like that only. Or a lot of us still are.

Matching incomes is not a bad thing, ideally. I remember, when a friend’s marriage was breaking up, one of the things was that rankled was their approach to money. While she was middle-class in her thinking, putting off the lights and fans whenever she left a room or haggled with auto-wallahs, the guy was beyond such cares. On a daily basis, such things can blow up into something huge. So yes, coming from a similar income bracket isn’t such a bad idea. Same industry? What about all the gossip that follows if you break up? And, what about all your dark secrets that can be laid bare through common contacts? In other words, just like when you apply for a job, it’s easy to do a background check! So, it’s time to hold back on the drinks at office parties…you don’t want that making it to your profile!

But, while a friend I checked with, said she didn’t mind giving it a try, some others question the concept of getting matched with a “pro”. “I would much rather go with the flow,” one guy said, adding “What my partner does is not really the question. It’s the person that’s important.” Another, in his early twenties, who loves video games was thrilled with the idea of maybe finding someone from the gaming industry, so they could literally play together. However, he added sagely, “I think it’s for people who care about the ‘status’ of their spouse…who feel the need to show off, perhaps.”

Well, how about doing it the old-fashioned way? Whether you swipe right or left on Tinder if you find someone hot (or not), or check out their incomes, don’t lose focus on the real thing—finding a partner who understands you, not just your cranky boss and working hours, though that can be a good start. So, go ahead, log on! Finding the right someone never sounded as easy….or tough! Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it.

Two killed on Gaza-Egypt border in confrontation,"Hamas has been pursuing improved relations with Egypt, which keeps its border crossing with Gaza largely shut and has accused the group in the past of aiding militants in the Sinai.

(Source: Google Maps)

A Hamas security man and a member of a rival Islamist militant group were killed on Thursday in a confrontation in the Gaza Strip near the Palestinian enclave’s border with Egypt, security sources said. Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, has stepped up patrols in the border area with the declared aim of preventing the movement of so-called Jihadist Salafis between the territory and the Sinai peninsula, where Islamic State has been battling Egyptian troops for years.

“A security force stopped two persons who approached the border. One of them blew himself up and was killed. The other was wounded,” the Hamas-run Interior Ministry said in a statement. It said several Hamas security men were hurt, and hospital officials told reporters that one of them died of his wounds. Security sources said the militant killed in the blast was a member of a Salafi group.

Hamas has been pursuing improved relations with Egypt, which keeps its border crossing with Gaza largely shut and has accused the group in the past of aiding militants in the Sinai. Hamas has denied those allegations. Gaza’s Salafis are proponents of global holy war endorsed by Islamic State and al Qaeda. Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 from forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, has shown little tolerance for Salafi movements, detaining many of their members and raiding homes in searches for weapons.

Both were great generals. Both Virginians. Both came from slave-owning plantation families. Is it really so far-fetched to put Robert E. Lee in the same category as George Washington, as President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday?

Many historians say yes.

” It’s a ridiculous conflation,” said Professor Alice Fahs of the University of California, Irvine. “He’s not a founding father, and it’s as though Trump thinks he is. It’s really astonishing. It’s amazing.”

Trump’s remarks on Tuesday came as he was defending those who have sought to preserve the statue of Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, the focus of a violent weekend clash in which an anti-racist protester was killed. The president didn’t exactly equate the Confederate general with the nation’s founding fathers. But he noted a similarity sometimes glossed over _ ownership of slaves by figures who nobly stand or sit astride horses on U.S. pedestals _ and he asked: If you’re going to be pulling down statues, “where does it stop?”

“So, this week it’s Robert E. Lee,” he said. “I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?”

There is no notable movement to tear down the Washington monument. Most historians are in agreement that Washington and Jefferson’s ownership of slaves has tainted the positive legacy they left. And some monuments and memorials to both men attempt to address that part of their lives.

For some, monuments to those founding fathers “force us to contemplate the centrality of slavery to the making of the nation,” said Gregory Downs, a history professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the impact of the Civil War on the United States. But he also said the difference between the nation’s first president, George Washington, and then man who sought to secede from the nation, Robert E. Lee, isn’t complicated.

“It is obvious that traitors in arms to the nation are not equivalent to those who created it,” he said.

Adding to the complexity of the debate, many Lee memorials were erected long after the Civil War as part of an effort to rehabilitate Lee’s reputation and denigrate his victorious opponent Ulysses S. Grant, who fought to preserve the nation and later defended black civil rights as president.

In that sense the memorials “celebrated two historical crimes,” Downs said. “First, treasonous secession for the purpose of preserving and expanding slavery forever. Second, the violent and fraudulent creation of Jim Crow segregation.”

Associate Professor Michael Green of the University of Nevada Las Vegas added, “A lot of Southerners glorified Lee into something more than he was.” Lee has been portrayed as kindly to slaves, which he was not, and conflicted about which side to fight for, which is inaccurate, Green said.

He concedes, however, that if “my ancestors had fought for the Confederacy, it’s possible I would feel a little differently. It’s important to look at historical figures so that we don’t look up at them or down on them, but from all angles.”

He said that historical consensus is very different now than when Trump learned it in school decades ago. People like Lee were presented as heroes and people like Frederick Douglass, about whom the president seemed to have little knowledge earlier this year, weren’t presented at all.

Lee and Washington in the same class? Said Downs: “Had the Confederacy won, a new nation founded on perpetuating slavery would have celebrated Robert E. Lee as its George Washington. Luckily for us, that effort failed.”

Garbine Muguruza powers into round of 16 at Cincinnati,"Garbine Muguruza stormed into the third round of Cincinnati with 6-2, 6-0 win over Beatriz Haddad Maia. (Source: AP) Garbine Muguruza stormed into the third round of Cincinnati with 6-2, 6-0 win over Beatriz Haddad Maia. (Source: AP)

Garbine Muguruza got her final U.S. Open tune-up event off to a flying start as the Wimbledon champion stormed by Brazilian qualifier Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-2 6-0 to reach the third round of the Cincinnati Open on Tuesday.

Second seed Simona Halep overcame an early deficit to beat American qualifier Taylor Townsend 6-4 6-1 and also reach the third round, while Venus Williams beat Alison Riske 6-2 6-0 to advance to the second.

French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko was upset 6-4 6-2 in the first round by unseeded Serbian Aleksandra Krunic and Agnieszka Radwanska, seeded 10th, was another to suffer an early exit, losing 6-4 6-4 to German Julia Gorges.

Spanish fourth seed Muguruza, fresh off a quarter-finals loss to eventual winner Elina Svitolina at Toronto last week, needed only 65 minutes to earn the straight sets win over Haddad Maia and book her spot in the round of 16.

After trading breaks with Haddad Maia over the course of the first four games, Muguruza found another gear and went on to win the final 10 games of the match.

“I felt like a lot of games were super tight. She’s super tall, big serve with big shots. It was a strange result, because the match was pretty good,” said world number six Muguruza.

“I feel like yesterday I was playing on the grass, and now I’m here. I’m happy to be in the third round here.”

Muguruza now awaits the winner of Wednesday’s clash between American 16th seed Madison Keys and Russian Daria Kasatkina.

Romanian Halep, the 2015 Cincinnati runner-up, fell behind early but reeled off four consecutive games, including two love service holds, to clinch the opening set and remained in control the rest of the way.

Halep will next face Latvia’s Anastasija Sevastova, who earlier rallied to beat China’s Peng Shuai 3-6 6-4 6-2.

Williams was aggressive from the start and only got better as the match went on, stepping in and finishing rallies at the net.

Fashion-conscious Williams’ biggest struggle on the court may have been with her jewellery after her hoop earring fell off at one point and later got tangled with her necklace.

The win set up a second round match-up against Australian Ashleigh Barty, who beat American Varvara Lepchenko earlier on Tuesday.

Sharad Yadav calls convention today,"Sharad Yadav at his residence in New Delhi

on Wednesday. Anil Sharma Sharad Yadav at his residence in New Delhion Wednesday. Anil Sharma

Four days after he was removed as the leader of the JD(U) parliamentary party by the dominant Nitish Kumar faction, Sharad Yadav on Wednesday called for a convention on Thursday to mobilise people for safeguarding the “composite culture” of India.

Yadav told the media that leaders from all Opposition parties, including the Congress, SP and Left parties, are likely to attend the convention. When asked who all would turn up, he said, “There would be hardly anybody from the Opposition who will not come.” Sources close to him said the invitees included Congress president Sonia Gandhi, vice-president Rahul Gandhi and party leaders Ahmed Patel and Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, RJD leader Lalu Prasad and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav.

Yadav was flanked by Ali Anwar Ansari, a Rajya Sabha member who has been suspended from the parliamentary party by the JD(U), and Arun Shrivastava, recently sacked from the post of general secretary as he spoke to reporters. Shrivastav earned the wrath of party chief Nitish Kumar after he “unauthorisedly” wrote to the Returning Officer of the Gujarat Assembly, appointing an election agent for the Rajya Sabha from the state. The lone JD(U) MLA in Gujarat, Chhotu Vasava, had voted for Congress’s Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha election despite a recently forged alliance between the BJP and JD(U).

Yadav said the “composite culture” was the soul of the Constitution, which, in his view, was being “tinkered with”.

Sources in the JD(U) indicated that the dominant faction would act against Yadav if he attended the RJD’s August 27 rally in Patna. JD(U) secretary-general K C Tyagi said, “He should not go to that rally. We have no problem with the questions he is raising. However, we will take exception to him sharing stage with tainted people… He should not be seen with evil forces.”

Maharashtra govt may raise bonds to fund irrigation projects in areas prone to drought,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Express photo by Prashant Nadkar Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Express photo by Prashant Nadkar

With more than Rs 80,000 crore required to complete ongoing irrigation projects in Maharashtra, the state’s water resources department wants the Chief Minister’s Office to consider allowing it to raise money through tax-free bonds.

Kicking off this financing plan, the department has submitted a proposal to raise Rs 3,000 crore through this route, said sources in the government.

The proposal is to permit irrigation development corporations to raise resources through such bonds, with the state government issuing guarantees for them.

Sources confirmed that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was in favour of the proposal, and is likely to approve it soon. Incidentally, it was during the previous Sena-BJP rule in Maharashtra in 1995-99 that the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) became the first state undertaking to similarly raise bonds.

This time, besides the MKVDC, the department is pushing to let other irrigation development corporations, including the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation and the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, which are overseeing a number of irrigation projects in drought-prone and suicide-prone belts, to raise bonds.

While Maharashtra has the largest number of dams in the country, its cultivated area under irrigation is far below the national average, with less than 20 per cent of the cultivated area brought under irrigation so far.

In 2017-18, the department has been allocated a budget of Rs 8,000 crore.

But irrigation department officials said that more than 360 major, medium, and minor irrigation projects, involving an expenditure of close to Rs 84,000 crore, were ongoing.

Apart from the state’s own budget, the Centre has pitched in, committing funding support of Rs 4000 crore for 26 crucial irrigation projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY).

Further, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has also extended a soft loan of Rs 12,000 crore for these 26 projects.

The department’s plan behind exploring the external funding option is to further. bridge the resource gap, said government sources.

The plan is to use the money raised through bonds to fund ongoing projects in drought-prone regions in areas where there was no irrigation backlog. As per Governor’s directives, a bulk of the public sector investment in this field from the state’s own budget is to be utilised for completion of projects in the irrigation backlog areas.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres — dominated by non-fiction — August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing — and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can’t wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 — but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound — the fiction in “The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told” will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia’s challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history — the old saga of blood, sweat and tears — about to resume its course?

Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward: India coach Ravi Shastri,"Ravi Shastri feels that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup. (Source: AP) Ravi Shastri feels that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup. (Source: AP)

After thrashing Sri Lanka 3-0 in the Test series team India has maintained their good run of form in Tests. The focus now shifts towards the one-day series which starts from August 20 in Dambulla. Ahead of the first ODI, India’s coach Ravi Shastri spoke to the Times of India where he revealed his thoughts regarding India’s preparation for 2019 World Cup, India’s excellence in Test cricket and the performance in the Sri Lankan Test series.

Stating that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup, Shastri said, “When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding XI in the world walking out. Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward and that’s right up there in the list of priorities.”

Shastri said that his long term goal is to focus on 2019 World Cup but also feels that India should continue to excel in Test matches as well, “The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, a fact also remains that if India needs to show their real might in the game, then achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle,” he opined.

Shastri also feels that preparation for the World Cup and continuing the good form in Tests, both require a different level of preparation. “Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with an equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it’s Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year”, he said and added, “A disciplined approach is what counts.”

“For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik and one in the third game from Shami, we’ve not faltered. How many catches did we drop? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid altogether. It’s the effort that counts. If we have to look at the bigger picture, we’re taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.”, he signed off.

"Internet firms shift stance, move to exile white supremacists","Earlier this week, Facebook Inc removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. (File) Earlier this week, Facebook Inc removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. (File)

Silicon Valley joined a swelling backlash against neo-Nazi groups in the United States on Wednesday as more technology companies removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Social media networks Twitter Inc and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc were among the companies cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.

Earlier in the week, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and GoDaddy Inc also took steps to block hate groups.

The wave of internet crackdowns against white nationalists and neo-Nazis reflected a rapidly changing mindset among Silicon Valley firms on how far they are willing to go to police hate speech.

Tech companies have taken down violent propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups, in part in response to government pressure. But most internet companies have traditionally tried to steer clear of making judgments about content except in cases of illegal activity.

Cloudflare, which protects some 6 million websites from denial-of-service attacks and hacking, on Wednesday afternoon dropped coverage of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer.

“I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet,” Cloudflare founder and Chief Executive Matthew Prince said in an email to employees.

Cloudflare is well-known for defending even the most distasteful websites, and services like it are essential to the functioning of websites.

Daily Stormer helped organize the weekend rally in Charlottesville where a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a man plowed a car into a crowd protesting the white nationalist gathering.

Daily Stormer has been accessible only intermittently the past few days after domain providers GoDaddy and Google Domains, a unit of Alphabet, said they would not serve the website.

By Wednesday, Daily Stormer had moved to a Russia-based internet domain, with an address ending in .ru. Later in the day, though, the site was no longer accessible at that address.

Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin said on a social network used by many of his supporters, Gab, that his site would be back soon.

“The Cloudflare betrayal adds another layer of super complexity. But we got this,” he said. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.

Prince, the Cloudflare chief executive, said in an interview that despite his decision he was conflicted, because it could become harder to resist pressure from governments to censor.

“You don’t have to play this game too many moves out to see how risky this is going to be,” Prince said. “‘What about this site? What about this site?'”

Only the biggest companies will be able to navigate the varying laws in different countries, he added. “We’ve lost a lot of the fight for a free and open internet.”

Twitter on Wednesday suspended accounts linked to Daily Stormer. The company said it would not discuss individual accounts, but at least three affiliated with the Daily Stormer led to pages saying “account suspended.”

The social network prohibits violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct and “will take action on accounts violating those policies,” the company said in a statement.

Larger rival Facebook Inc, which unlike Twitter explicitly prohibits hate speech, has taken down several pages from Facebook and Instagram in recent days that it said were associated with hate speech or hate organizations. It also took down the event page that was used to promote and organize the “Unite the Right” rally.

“With the potential for more rallies, we’re watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.

Facebook also said it had removed accounts belonging to Chris Cantwell, a web commentator who has described himself as a white nationalist and said on his site that he had attended the Charlottesville rally. Cantwell’s YouTube account also appeared to have been terminated.

Cantwell could not immediately be reached for comment.

LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp, suspended a page devoted to Daily Stormer and another page belonging to a man associated with the site, Andrew Auernheimer. LinkedIn declined to comment.

Reddit this week eliminated one of its discussion communities that supported the Unite the Right rally, saying that the company would ban users who incite violence. The company says it has more than 250 million users.

Spotify, based in Sweden, said it was in the process of removing musical acts from its streaming service that had been flagged as racist “hate bands” by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

“Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us,” the company said in a statement, adding that record companies should also be held responsible.

Phoenix mayor not happy about President Donald Trump’s rally plans,"US President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File) US President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File)

President Donald Trump plans to rally supporters in Phoenix next week, and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton is not happy about it. Trump’s campaign announced the event Wednesday _ a day after the president blamed “both sides” for weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators.

The August 22 rally will take place at the Phoenix Convention Center, the campaign said. “I am disappointed that President Trump has chosen to hold a campaign rally as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville,” Stanton said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. “It is my hope that more sound judgment prevails and that he delays his visit.”

The president has been holding campaign-style events in Trump-friendly areas since he took office. Next week’s rally will be his first in the West. Trump told Fox News in an interview this week that he may pardon former metro Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who recently was convicted in federal court for disobeying a judge’s order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that Arpaio’s officers had racially profiled Latinos.

Arpaio, 85, is scheduled to be sentenced October 5 and faces up to six months in jail. Attorneys who have followed the case doubt someone his age would be incarcerated, however. Critics say a pardon would amount to an endorsement of racism.

“If President Trump is coming to Phoenix to announce a pardon for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, then it will be clear that his true intent is to enflame emotions and further divide our nation,” Stanton said.

"What makes Britain’s biggest ever warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, special","The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS) The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS)

Thousands of enthusiasts on Wednesday lined up at the Portsmouth seafront, to welcome what is said to be the biggest-ever warship of Britan. Named HMS Queen Elizabeth, the 280 meters long vessel weighing 65,000 tonnes cost more than 3 billion-pound to build.

The vessel that was in construction since 2009 has been training at sea since June after setting out from Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the vessel also has an identical sister ship called HMS Prince of Wales, which will be commissioned three years later. Both the carriers built for the Royal Navy will replace the now-decommissioned HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious and will lead the UK’s Naval Force for the coming years.

HMS Queen Elizabeth has a speed of 25 knots per hour that can help it to cover a distance of 500 miles per day. The gigantic ship weighs three times the size of its predecessor, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal. Few of the on-board features include a hospital, a police office, commanding officer’s suite and a bakery as well. The ship is also equipped with 1,000 twin propellers that generate power that can run 1,000 cars.

The vessel also has an in-built reverse osmosis equipment that can produce 500 tones of fresh water each day. As a result, the ship can play an essential role in providing humanitarian relief in cases of a crisis. The carrier will also provide a four-acre military operating base to the armed forces.

The war ship is also equipped with a fully integrated waste management system that ensures proper sanitary processing, storage and destruction of any kind of waste for the next 50 years. It also comes with a Glass Processing Equipment that helps in crushing compact glass products that can be further recycled.

The war-ship is also equipped with a cutting-edge 3D radar system known as Artisan 3D that makes it capable of detecting tiniest objects at a distance of 25 km. According to the builder Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the radar system can monitor more than 800 objects simultaneously from 200 to 200,000 metres and cut through radio interference equal to 10,000 mobile phone signals. The radar system has already proven its capability to deliver uncompromising air defence and anti-ship operations on the Type 23 frigate and helicopter carrier. The system will also be used for the first time to deliver air traffic management, providing the aircraft carriers with unparalleled awareness and control of the skies around them.

The range of the ship is 10,000 nautical miles. Few of the works for which the ship will be used include high intensity war fighting, disaster management and providing humanitarian aid.

“She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role,” Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said while welcoming the ship at its home port in southern England.

Critics cry foul as young Hong Kong democracy leaders get jail,"Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)

* Joshua Wong jailed for six months for unlawful assembly

* Jail terms disqualifies trio from running for seats for 5 years

* Terms slammed amid accusations of political interference

A Hong Kong appeals court jailed three leaders of the Chinese-ruled city’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

The jail terms will curtail the political ambitions of the trio, disqualifying them from running for seats in the financial hub’s legislature for the next five years.

Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but Hong Kong’s Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

Wong was jailed for six months, Chow for seven months and Law for eight months. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit.

The three appeared stern but calm as their sentences were delivered by a panel of three judges. A lawyer involved in the case said they would appeal. Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led democracy movement, punched his fist in the air as he left the court room and shouted: “Hong Kong people don’t give up.”

Minutes earlier he Tweeted: “They can silence protests, remove us from the legislature and lock us up. But they will not win the hearts and minds of Hongkongers.” Chow waved at his parents as he left the court. His mother broke down in tears.

The three judges in Hong Kong’s second highest court, the court of appeal, wrote in their judgment that the three could not say they were sentenced for exercising freedom of assembly in a city where many democrats see a gradual erosion of freedoms promised in 1997.

“In recent years, there’s been an unhealthy trend in Hong Kong society. Some people use the pursuit of ideals … as an excuse to take illegal action,” Judge Wally Yeung wrote.

“This case is a prime example of the aforementioned unhealthy trend.”

The former British colony, which has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by nearly three months of mostly peaceful street occupations in late 2014, demanding Beijing grant the city full democracy.

The so-called “Umbrella Movement” civil disobedience movement, which drew hundreds of thousands of protesters at its peak, was triggered by Wong and his colleagues storming into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters.

They were later charged with participating in and inciting an unlawful assembly.

Just before sentencing, Wong told over a hundred supporters who thronged into the court lobby, some weeping, that he had no regrets.

“I hope Hong Kong people won’t give up,” he said. “Victory is ours. When we are released next year I hope we can see a Hong Kong that is full of hope. I want to see Hong Kong people not giving up. This is my last wish before I go to jail.”

About 100 supporters later swarmed the prison vans taking the three away from court, shouting slogans, a Reuters witness said. At least one person was taken away by police.

Wong told Reuters on Wednesday that Hong Kong’s democratic movement was facing its “darkest era” and that he’d lost confidence in the city’s independent legal system, long considered one of the best in Asia.

DISSENTING VIEWS

A senior government source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said Hong Kong’s top prosecutors had initially “not recommended pursuing” the case further” after the non-jail terms were handed down.

But Hong Kong’s Secretary of Justice, Rimsky Yuen, overruled them and insisted on re-opening Wong’s case, a decision that ultimately led to their imprisonment, the source said.

In response to emailed questions from Reuters to Yuen seeking clarification, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said it “does not comment on internal discussions regarding individual cases”.

“However, the DoJ (Department of Justice) reiterates that all decisions were made in accordance with the Prosecution Code, the applicable law and relevant evidence.”

The DoJ said in an earlier statement there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive”.

Critics disagreed.

“From the initial choice to prosecute these young democrats through to today’s hearing, these cases have been shot through by politics, not law,” China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement.

“That Hong Kong’s courts increasingly appear to operate as mainland courts do is clear evidence that ‘one country, two systems’ is on the ropes – with ominous consequences for all,”

Amnesty International also slammed the jail terms.

“The relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities,” said Mabel Au, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.

Under the “two systems” formula, Hong Kong enjoys a free judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

In recent months, dozens of protesters, mostly young people, have been jailed for their roles in various protests, including a violent demonstration that the government called a riot in early 2016. (Additional reporting by Tyrone Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Nick Macfie)

China announces $1 million aid for flood-hit Nepal,"Representational Image/ AP Representational Image/ AP

AS NEPAL faces its worst floods in the past three decades, with the death toll on Tuesday rising to more than 115, China’s visiting Premier Wang Yang announced a $1 million package for “instant relief” to the victims and formalised agreements worth multi-billion Rupees that are likely to have a significant implication in the bilateral relations. Nepal and China signed three different agreements — a Rs 2-billion project for joint exploration of petroleum, natural gas and mines; Rs 15-billion project for upgradation of Arniko highway built in the 60s that remains dysfunctional following 2015 April earthquake; and for building a bridge along the Kerung-Rasuwagarhi road, currently under construction. The two sides also agreed to invite more Chinese investment in Nepal.

China’s support to the flood victims comes even before the Nepalese government has been able to make preliminary estimates about the loss of life and property as the ravage continues. Vice-Premier Wang started his day with the opening of the construction of the erstwhile royal palace under China’s technical and financial support two years after it was destroyed in the earthquake. He also had a series of meetings with K P Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, both former PMs and the chiefs of Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist and Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre, and Bijay Gachedar and KB Mahara, both deputy prime ministers.

IISER gets centre for high-end cancer research,"Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune. (Source: Wikipedia) Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune. (Source: Wikipedia)

To promote research work in life sciences, the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune, has set up an excellence centre that will help in analysis of hundreds of biological samples, simultaneously. With this centre, biologists are set to take cancer tumour research to a new level, said an official. The Centre of Excellence, which was inaugurated by K N Ganesh, director, IISER (Pune), on Wednesday, has been set up by PerkinElmer, in association with IISER.

Speaking to The Indian Express about the biggest advantages of the centre, Sanjeev Galande, head of biology department said, “The new centre will have a very high throughput capacity. This means, simultaneous analysing and studying of large number of samples will now be possible. It will not only save time but also help improve the accuracy in work.”

The construction of the centre involved an investment of around Rs 10 crore. It is set to benefit about 500 students — from across the fields of biology, chemistry and physics — who are involved in integrated researches, added Galande.

About the key areas of study where the centre can particularly benefit the researchers, he said, “We have a lot of work coming up in the field of cancer tumour research. One of the prime aims is to study cancer tumour samples using this high-end technology.”

Broadly, the centre will house instruments, such as high-content analysis and automated liquid handling workstations, plate readers, and those used for multi-spectral imaging.

According to Jayashree Thacker, president, PerkinElmer, India, “The opening of this new facility and our collaboration with IISER supports the expansion of PerkinElmer and our relationship with leading research organisations in India. It further positions us to deliver innovative solutions to our customers.”

Director K N Ganesh hailed the collaboration with the industry for taking research outside mere laboratories. “This is an excellent example of industry-academia collaboration. This advanced bio-analytical set up will not only hone the analytical skills of undergraduate students but also elevate their understanding of interdisciplinary sciences.”

After being whitewashed in the three-match Test series against India, Sports Minister of Sri Lanka Dayasriri Jayasekera called for a report from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), saying that they must know the reasons for the defeat.

The Sports Minister said that he had a long meeting where he discussed the defeat. Speaking to media on Wednesday, Jayasekera said, “This teams capability is not a question but we must know the reasons for the defeat.”

He, however, pointed out that it was a defeat to ‘the top team in the world.’ “We also have to remember that India is the top team in the world, so the defeat has to be seen from that view point too,” he said.

Amidst criticism of the board, former captain Arjuna Ranatunga called for Sumathipala to step down as SLC boss. Jayasekera said that the decision to change an elected body is not in their hands. “We can’t change an elected body, that can be done only at the next election,” Jayasekera said.

“When there were interim committees which ran Sri Lanka Cricket for 8 years, no one complained. It was only this government which took action to hold elections (for the SLC),” said Jayasekera, who said that he would soon sit down with the players to discuss the way forward.

How a new directive by Sebi looks set to change the rules of the borrowing game,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo)

Four years ago, minutes after taking over as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan made the now famous statement about promoters not having a divine right to stay in charge if they could not manage an enterprise. For many promoters, life has been difficult not just because of a business downturn, but also because rules of the game have changed considerably over the last couple of years. The new insolvency law that came into effect this year has seen a dozen-odd corporates being referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which will ensure either a quick turnaround, or closure.

The nature of the relationship between lender and borrower or debtor and creditor, especially where big business groups are involved, has long been skewed in favour of the borrower. This situation now looks set to change.

Earlier this month, the securities market regulator, Sebi, unveiled a new rule under which listed firms will have to publicly disclose, within one working day, any default on a bond or loan that it commits, either in local or international markets, or on any other securities. Such defaults were hitherto not made public — banks cited confidentiality agreements entered into with borrowers as the reason — and credit rating agencies, therefore, often fell behind the curve.

The new rule, which comes into effect from October, will potentially trigger behavioural changes among banks, firms and investors.

India’s bankers have been used to even some of the better names stretching the concept of working capital liquidity by making interest payments, in many cases, up to 89 days after the due date — just in time to ensure that the loan does not turn ‘bad’ (mandatory when interest or instalment on the principal remains unpaid for 90 days or longer). Often, fresh funds are lent to group firms to prevent a loan from being classified as a bad loan — a practice that is known as “evergreening”.

Such quiet arrangements between banks and borrowers could be put to test in the new regime — unless lenders, especially among the private banks, design new ways to escape the regulator’s gaze and game the system. The new rule should impose a higher degree of credit discipline on both the borrower and the bank to prevent an early default. This is because a public disclosure of even a small default can impact not just the company’s stock, but also its ability to raise capital in the future. It will mean a downgrade by credit rating agencies, with implications for the cost of borrowing.

For banks, it should indicate a much closer monitoring of loans or credit. For investors, the rule change will provide an early opportunity to assess the risks of staying on, and help them cut losses rather than holding on to a lemon without any way to recover their funds.

The rule change should also make it more difficult for promoters or businessmen to nudge bankers to go easy on repayments. The real test of this new preventive measure to stem the build-up of bad loans already aggregating Rs 8 lakh crore will come after October. In the current business cycle, with many firms struggling, the frequency of downgrades with each public disclosure of a default should logically be higher. That is something the regulators should be looking at closely.

It seems apparent that the top financial regulators are working to ensure that listed banks have to now disclose publicly the reason for the divergence of over 15% in the numbers furnished by them and the one reached by the banking regulator after inspection. Three private banks, including two leading ones, have figured in such a list. It casts doubts on the integrity of accounts, the role of audit committees, and the boards of the banks, and leaves investors with the apprehension of more bad news. Elsewhere, when the integrity of financial accounts is violated, punishments are swift. Indian regulators haven’t come down as hard on such practices as their global peers. The P J Nayak Committee, which reviewed the governance of bank boards, suggested a way forward: levying of penalties through cancellation of unvested stock options, clamping down on monetary bonuses for the top management and full-time directors, and directing the chairman of the audit committee to step down from the board of the bank.

As the global experience shows, cleaning up banks can be a prolonged and painful affair. It will be a test of political resolve — especially because not enough jobs are being created and existing jobs are being threatened with more companies being referred to the insolvency forum — besides governance, integrity and regulatory capacity. During the last such cycle over 15 years ago, when too, an NDA government was in power, the pedal was eased as soon as the recovery started. For years after that, the can was kicked further down the road. Doing that again may be difficult.

A Texas university has cancelled a planned white supremacist rally on its campus next month, citing safety concerns following the deadly violence at a rally in Virginia at the weekend. Texas A&M University, one of the most prestigious public colleges in the United States, scrapped a September 11 rally at which known white supremacist leader Richard Spencer was scheduled to speak.

Spencer was one of the leading figures in a rally that saw hundreds of white supremacists gather Saturday in the town of Charlottesville, triggering violence that left one person dead and 19 others injured. The university’s decision to cancel the event came after it emerged that organisers were billing the event as “Today Charlottesville, Tomorrow Texas A&M.”

“Linking the tragedy of Charlottesville with the Texas A&M event creates a major security risk on our campus,” the university said in a statement. Spencer has asked sympathisers to invite him to speak on campuses, and he has been invited to speak at the University of Florida on September 12, although authorities have yet to give their approval.

In an open letter to students, University of Florida president Kent Fuchs indicated how the college was torn over whether to give the event the green light. “For many in our community, including myself, this speaker’s presence would be deeply disturbing,” Fuchs wrote, before adding that “we must follow the law, upholding the First Amendment not to discriminate based on content and provide access to a public space.”

Taiwan official resigns after blackout hits much of island,"Taiwan’s economy minister has resigned after a generator failure at a power plant caused a massive blackout that affected millions of households across the island during sweltering heat. The power outage plunged traffic, shopping malls and offices into darkness early last evening.

Taiwan’s Central News Agency says “an operational technical error” caused six generators to stop working at Taiwan’s biggest natural gas power plant. Taiwan’s economy minister Lee Chih-kung apologised at a news conference and said the person who made the error would be punished.

CNA says 6.68 million households were affected in the capital, Taipei, cities Taichung and Tainan and three counties in the center, west and southwest of the island of 23 million people. The defense ministry said back-up power supply ensured no disruption to military operations.

Rural Education: How to make our government village schools deliver better results,"One indicator of the above trend is data from a recent draft report (‘Guidelines for Rationalisation of Small Schools across States for Better Efficiency’) by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). One indicator of the above trend is data from a recent draft report (‘Guidelines for Rationalisation of Small Schools across States for Better Efficiency’) by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).

LAST MONTH, the Supreme Court quashed the appointment of 1.32 lakh primary teachers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) whom the previous state government had regularised from being ad hoc Shiksha Mitras. The Court held that they did not fulfil the minimum qualification criteria for passing the Teacher’s Eligibility Test and also weren’t appointed against sanctioned posts.

The judgment has created uncertainty not just for the Shiksha Mitras — people originally hired on contract to assist professional teachers — but also for the primary education system in a state, where almost 52 per cent of elementary-level students are already enrolled with private schools. The recent past has seen large-scale migration of students from government to private schools, even in rural areas.

The key factors responsible for the increased privatisation of primary education – which the latest ruling, if anything, may only further accelerate – are apathetic attitude of teachers (made worse by the abysmal qualifications of new recruits), low and uneven teacher-pupil ratio, and lack of sanitation, classroom infrastructure and other basic amenities in government schools. Private schools, on the other hand, have marketed the claims of committed teachers, focus on English language and computer courses, offering transport facilities, etc. to lure parents. All this received added impetus during the last decade, with rising rural incomes and aspirations as captured by a story in this newspaper (http://bit.ly/28Yd1Jb).

One indicator of the above trend is data from a recent draft report (‘Guidelines for Rationalisation of Small Schools across States for Better Efficiency’) by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). It shows as many as 2.5 lakh government schools at primary (class 1-5) and upper primary (6-8) level in India having less than 30 students. These numbers have, in fact, risen significantly in the last few years. The picture could turn out even grimmer, if an ongoing Aadhaar unique identification number-based enrolment of students were to – most likely – throw up many fictitious/ghost pupils in the government school system.

Given the resultant wastage of resources, the MHRD has proposed merging of small schools. As enrolment levels in these schools are anyway low, the move is unlikely to encounter major public opposition. But while such rationalisation might improve the students-per-school numbers in the short run, the problem of low enrolment would only resurface in the medium/long term if the systemic issues remain unaddressed.

It is often argued that one way to check privatisation – especially of the unhealthy kind – is to simply hire more teachers in government schools. But that, under the prevailing incentive and accountability systems, is unlikely to work, more so in rural areas. The authorities may even ensure that teachers attend schools, but can they be made more accountable? Government schoolteachers are more likely to justify the poor academic performance of students, by citing lack of motivation due to the latter coming mostly from the marginalised sections of society. It would be difficult really to separate the impact of lower teacher commitment from the apparent poor motivation of students in government schools. Even if teachers’ slackness is established, service rules make it virtually impossible to reduce their salary, leave alone terminate employment. On the other hand, the system isn’t equipped to identify and reward committed teachers.

It’s not that the situation in private schools is radically better. The government must not leave the functioning of private schools entirely to market forces for two reasons. First, information about quality of product is key to the functioning of any market. In the absence of any comparable quality indicators at elementary school level, one cannot expect the market to deliver efficient outcomes. Second, left purely to market forces, school fees and teacher salaries would be determined by the average income levels of a region. It follows, then, that low-income regions with lesser ability to pay school fees will also find it difficult to attract quality teachers.

According to National Sample Survey (71st Round) data, the median tuition fee in private rural schools of UP in was just Rs 117 per month in 2014. Governments, including that in UP, are trying to address the burden to families from high school fees – which they, indeed, should. However, there’s no discussion on the ‘low fee’ problem, despite it impacting learning outcomes in private schools, especially in the rural hinterland and mofussil towns.

The UP government should view the apex court’s verdict as an opportunity to look at creative hybrid solutions for improving the functioning of rural primary schools. There is a need, no doubt, to increase government expenditure on education, but in an efficient way.

An incentive structure could be created, wherein the government provides education vouchers/coupons worth, say, Rs 500 per month, to parents. To help them choose the right school — so as to address the information asymmetry problem — the government can involve external agencies to assess the performance of individual schools. These results can be made public in a format comprehensible to laypersons. Based on this information, parents can then present these encashable vouchers to schools of their choice — government or private. The Aadhaar enrolment process would take care of duplicate/fictitious students in schools, making it easier to implement the voucher program.

Trump to discuss South Asia strategy with top aides,"In this Aug. 14, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump pauses while speaking in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington. Is it really so far-fetched to put Robert E. Lee in the same category as George Washington, as President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday? Many historians say yes.

President Donald Trump is set to discuss with his national security team the US’ strategy in South Asia, including developing a new regional policy for resolving the long-running conflict in Afghanistan that may include both India and Pakistan. Trump will meet the team tomorrow at Camp David, a picturesque presidential retreat in Maryland, nearly 100 kms from Washington DC.

US National Security Advisor Lt Gen H R McMaster would be among those attending the meeting, the White House said. “The President along with the Vice President will meet with the National Security Team on Friday at Camp David to discuss the South Asia strategy,” it said.

The South Asia strategy primarily means the policy in Afghanistan, but the Trump administration feels that the war-torn country needs a regional approach to resolve the decades old problem.

In the past few weeks, senior officials of the Trump administration have gone on record to say that the regional approach to Afghanistan means inclusion of both India and Pakistan.

However, the officials so far have remained tight-lipped on what this means for India given that Pakistan has been averse to any Indian role in Afghanistan.

During the Bush administration and the initial years of the Obama administration, Pakistan had successfully managed to keep India out of major strategic conferences on Afghanistan. However, the successive administrations in the US have acknowledged the role of India in the development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. After the US, India is one of the largest donors for developmental projects in Afghanistan.

"Charlottesville violence: After top CEOs desert Donald Trump, White House officials to follow?","President Donald Trump recently blamed “many sides” for the Charlottesville violence in Virgnia. (AP Photo/File) President Donald Trump recently blamed “many sides” for the Charlottesville violence in Virgnia. (AP Photo/File)

Following US President Donald Trump’s decision on Tuesday to once again blame “many sides” for the Charlottesville violence that took place on August 12, chief executives at companies such as Merck & Co Inc, Under Armour Inc, Intel Corp, Campbell Soup Co and 3M Co have quit advisory councils to the White House. Soon enough, the President’s business advisory groups were disbanded by Trump himself. The Manufacturing Council and Strategy & Policy Forum were formed last year to advise Trump on economic issues.

But before the most influential CEOs of the country could make a statement announcing their decision, Trump, who reportedly got a whiff about the defection, took matters into his own hands. “Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!” he wrote on Twitter. The development is likely to cause a huge blow to Trump whose support base included corporate leaders.

It has also led to conjectures that top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who is a Jew, may resign as a mark of protest. Sources, however, have told Reuters that Cohn, though upset with Trump’s remarks would, for now, stay in the administration. When Trump reverted his statements on neo-Nazis and white supremacists on Tuesday, blaming “alt-left” for the Charlottesville violence, Cohn looked “self-conscious and uncomfortable.”

“He just did not want to be in that position … and he was not good at hiding his body language for that,” a former administration official who knows Cohn was quoted as saying by Reuters.

The business executives, however, are not the only ones experiencing discomfiture. Speculations suggest some top officials in the Trump administration might quit amid apprehensions that the US President’s comments might damage their own reputation.

“A lot of us joined this administration thinking we could bring to it the experience and expertise that the president didn’t have an opportunity to gain in his business career, and to encourage some restraint in what he says publicly and to our allies,” a senior official who is contemplating whether to resign told Reuters. Referring to Trump’s new chief of staff retired General John Kelly, the official continued: “After yesterday, it’s clear that there is no way for anyone, even a Marine general, to restrain his (Trump’s) impulses or counter what he sees on TV and reads on the web.”

On Saturday, hundreds of white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville to protest the removal of the statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from a park. Protests took a violent turn after the white nationalists groups, including neo-Nazis and KKK members, clashed with counter demonstrators. One woman was killed after a 20-year-old rammed a car into the crowd injuring at least 19 others.

PMO sends TMC MP’s complaint against top cops to CVC,"HAVING RECEIVED a petition from suspended Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh, alleging that senior West Bengal police officers had “tampered (with) evidence’’ in the Saradha chit fund scam, the Prime Minister’s Office has referred the matter to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

Ghosh sent his petition on June 7, alleging that a section of officers, including Rajiv Kumar, the then head of the state government-appointed special investigation team (SIT) and at present the Kolkata Police commissioner, had tampered with evidence.

He is learnt to have named Surojit Kar Purakayastha, then I-G, Law and Order, and now the state’s director general of police, as well in his petition.

DGP Kar Purkayastha said, “I have no idea about this (allegation).” Other senior officers accused by Ghosh remained unavailable for a comment.

According to an official communication dated August 2 and signed by S P R Tripathi, Under Secretary, Government of India, Ghosh’s petition has been forwarded to the CVC for “appropriate action”.

“I have received a copy of the order,” Ghosh told The Indian Express.

The Saradha chit fund scandal emerged in 2013, when around 200 companies failed to pay their investors. The state government set up an SIT with officers of Bidhannagar commissionerate. In 2014, the Supreme Court handed over the probe to CBI.

Men find sexual assault as traumatising as women do: Research,"These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo) These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo)

Men are often looked at only as perpetrators of sexual assaults. But what happens to those men who become victims of such assaults? These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research.

Sexual assault is unwanted sexual contact — including rape — and is a traumatising event linked to numerous mental health consequences associated with negative outcomes such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear, anxiety, alcohol dependence, use of illicit substances, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide. While there is extensive research on the collateral consequences experienced by females, almost no research exists on how sexual violence affects adult, non-incarcerated males or how it affects them as compared to females.

The new findings, published in the journal Women & Criminal Justice, challenge a sociological theory that explains that men are more likely to respond to sexual assault with anger and by engaging in criminal activity, while women are more likely to respond with depression and sadness.

“When we began this study, we thought for sure that we would find that females who were sexually assaulted would exhibit higher depression scores than males who were sexually assaulted,” said lead researcher Lisa Dario, Assistant Professor at Florida Atlantic University in the US.

“I think this is probably because of antiquated ideas that men and women experience emotions differently. What we actually discovered, much to our surprise, is that sexual assault is traumatic regardless of gender,” Dario added. The study involved a sample size of 11,860 adults in the US — 5,922 men and 5,938 women — obtained from the National Violence Against Women Survey’s database.

The researchers found that all victims of sexual assault had higher depression scores than individuals who have had not experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.

Men make up about 38 percent of sexual assault and rape incidents reported, and those in the military are particularly vulnerable and more unlikely to report an assault, according to the US National Crime Victimisation Survey results. The researchers suspect that it is possible that men may even experience depression more than women because they do not have the social outlets and support systems available to women, and therefore may wind up internalising their feelings and emotions.

“There is no room for ‘sexism’ in sexual assault research [by ignoring male victims] and we must bring attention to an issue that impacts men equally, especially if we know that their negative emotional responses are treatable,” Dario said.

"Urban bodies polls In Madhya Pradesh, BJP wins 25 seats, Congress improves tally to 15","THE BJP on Wednesday won 25 of the 43 posts of presidents of urban bodies, while the Congress improved its tally to 15. In the first electoral test after the farmers’ unrest in June, Independent candidates also won as presidents in three urban bodies. About eight lakh voters exercised their franchise on August 11 for the election of presidents in Nagar Palikas and Nagar Parishads, besides bypolls in these bodies.

This came a day before BJP president Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Bhopal to begin a three-day exercise from Friday to strengthen the party organisation.

The Congress said BJP had no reason to celebrate because it had lost three posts of presidents, while it had improved its tally from nine to 15. The opposition party said its candidates lost narrowly in four places by margins ranging between 50 and 200 and that it had emerged victorious in larger bodies.

However, the ruling BJP claimed it was a resounding victory and that it had not lost ground despite the recent unrest in several parts of the state. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan,who had campaigned extensively, credited the victory to development.

Describing the outcome as satisfactory, state Congress chief Arun Yadav said the results proved that people have voted for change and that the party significantly improved its tally despite the CM’s whirlwind campaign and “misuse” of official machinery by the ruling party.

Also, green and yellow balanced the blues with rich shades of berry, ivory and hints of gold and silver touches.

Masaba's collection this season is aimed at a girls trousseau or a destination wedding in the tropics. The collection is a perfect pick for the millennial bride. The subtle Sakalava tribe face paintings alongside the bountiful orchard gardens serve as a canvas for the prints. Linear grass prints and abstract foliage and floral buds in fluid strokes are brought to life through colour on colour pigments and digital prints.

The line centres around progressive Indian wear featuring outfits with a contemporary and fresh take on tradition such as flowy anarkalis with caped backs and corsets, clouded silk dresses with knots flowing through seams.

UN removes last container holding Colombia rebel weapons,"UN observers have removed the last of more than 8,000 guns once carried by the guerrillas of Colombia’s largest rebel army and collected at 26 demobilisation sites around the South American nation under a historic peace deal. Rebels agreed to disarm as part of the pact reached with the government last year, and some of the weapons will be smelted and transformed into statues commemorating the end to Latin America’s longest-running armed conflict.

“This puts the country on the path to a new future,” Jean Arnault, head of the United Nations’ mission in Colombia, said yesterday at a ceremony where President Juan Manuel Santos put a lock on the final container as leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, looked on. Former FARC rebels finished turning over their individual weapons in late June, and since then the guns have been locked up and guarded by UN observers. Yesterday the last remaining container was taken from a transition zone in northern Colombia.

In addition to some 8,112 guns, Arnault said the United Nations collected 1.3 million bullets, 22 tons of explosives, 3,000 grenades and 1,000 land mines from the rebels. “Building peace is like building a cathedral, and today we are laying the foundation,” said Santos, winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to win an end to hostilities.

In another sign of the FARC’s transition, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that 24 child fighters were received at seven rebel camps. Since the peace deal was signed, the FARC has turned over a total of 112 teenage fighters to the Red Cross.

The FARC was formed in the early 1960s by guerrillas affiliated with Colombia’s communist party intent on resolving longstanding issues such as land disputes and government neglect of rural areas, issues that still resonate in much of the nation today.

Over the next five decades, the conflict between the rebels, government forces and right-wing paramilitaries claimed at least 250,000 lives and left another 60,000 people missing. Millions more were displaced from their homes fleeing the bloodshed.

The handing over of rebel arms is a fundamental component of the peace accord, which also aims to reduce Colombia’s booming coca production by encouraging farmers to grow food crops instead and expand the state’s presence in remote areas where basic utilities like running water and electricity can be scarce.

The rebel leader known by the nom de guerre Ivan Marquez took advantage of the media attention on Tuesday’s ceremony to preview what he said is likely to be the name of the former rebels’ new political movement: the Revolutionary Alternative Force of Colombia, preserving the Spanish acronym FARC.

“We will be part of the system but raise our voice clearly and sharply against the system,” Marquez said. UN observers first began removing the locked weapons containers in late July.

Sketches of a Poet’s soul,"Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature.

Book- Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems

Translated by- Baran Farooqi

Publication- Penguin Random House India

Pages- 304

Price- Rs 499

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images. Faiz symbolises a turning point in the history of the Urdu language — his name evokes memories of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), his poetry is reminiscent of an era when the best of minds produced great literature in Urdu, which inspires writers and poets even today.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz’s poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives

Faiz’s name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‘art for the sake of art’ and ‘art with no political objective’. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‘25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan’. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who “did not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces”.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‘Poetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines’, placed Faiz’s work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‘effective’. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as “armchair socialists”, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz’s political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‘illuminating’ information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‘king of romantic realism’ deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form — and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote — then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi’s translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‘farsi rasm-ul khat’ the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I’ve gone through, Farooqi’s translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz’s poetry. I’m sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

Suspect falls to death from atop crane at Los Angeles port,"A suspected car thief led police on a chase across Los Angeles before he ditched the vehicle and climbed to the top of a loading crane at the city’s port, dangling over edges and stripping naked before falling to his death. The man fell about 160 feet to the ground and died about three hours after he first scaled the crane Wednesday night. It’s not clear whether he slipped or jumped deliberately, Los Angeles fire officials said.

Police in Los Angeles spotted the car reported stolen from a dealership in San Bernardino, and an hours-long chase ensued, the LAPD said. Several television stations broadcast the chase live, showing the SUV swerving at high speed through freeway traffic in LA and Long Beach, sometimes crossing into oncoming lanes.

He drove into the vast complex of the Port of Los Angeles and drove into a terminal, circling back and forth under giant loading cranes and next to a docked ship before jumping out of the still-moving SUV and racing up the stairs of the crane. He broke a window and climbed into the crane cab, then climbed out, walked to the end of the crane over water as darkness fell.

Port workers stopped their labor and watched the scene, some with binoculars. Police waited below for him for hours, worried that if they approached he might slip or jump.

As news helicopters hovered above, he shed his Lakers jersey and shoes, then later took off the rest of his clothes. He dangled and nearly fell several times before eventually plunging to the ground. “Our officers were nowhere near to close proximity of the suspect at the time that he fell,” Detective Meghan Aguilar said. The man’s name has not been released. Eric Nosser, a salesman at the Subaru dealership the SUV was stolen from, says he steered clear of the man.

“I let him be, because he seemed on edge,” Nosser told KNBC-TV. “I figured he’d just kind of walk off and go about his business.” Instead the man found an SUV with the keys in it, got inside and took off.

Sehajdhari Sikhs lose right to vote in SGPC elections,"Sehajdhari Sikhs have been barred from voting in SGPC polls. Sehajdhari Sikhs have been barred from voting in SGPC polls.

The Union home ministry recently issued guidelines notifying the debarment of Sehajdhari Sikhs from voting in Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) elections.

The move is likely to trigger fresh protests from the Sehajdhari Sikhs, who, unlike baptised Sikhs, may trim their hair and may not wear the five articles of the faith. A Sehajdhari Sikh, however, believes in the 10 Sikh Gurus and the Guru Granth Sahib. As per the amended Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 (Punjab Act Number 1 of 1959), a Sehajdhari Sikh is a person who performs ceremonies according to Sikh rites, who does not use tobacco or halal meat, who is not a patit (an apostate) and who recites the mul manter. There are over 70 lakh Sehajdhari Sikhs in Punjab.

In a notification last week, the Ministry of Home Affairs omitted form I A that allowed voting rights to Sehajdhari Sikhs. The latest guidelines from the ministry came nearly a year after the Centre amended the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, said officials.

The matter has been hanging fire since 2011 after the Punjab and Haryana Court restored Sehajdharis’ right to vote, quashing the Centre’s 2003 notification.

According the new rules, only Keshdhari Sikhs can be registered as electors and will be required to declare that: a) I am a Sikh, b) I do not trim or shave my beard or kesha, c) I do not smoke or use kutha (halal) meat, d) I do not take alcoholic drinks and e) I am not a patit (an apostate).

The decision is likely to concetrate power only in the hands of Keshdhari Sikhs, explained and official privy to the matter.

Sehajdhari Sikh representative Paramjit Singh Rannu blamed the RSS for trying to take advantage of the situation. He said Sehajdhari Sikhs may have lost the right to vote in SGPC elections but will remain dedicated to the Guru Granth Sahib.

"We are the underdogs in Test series against England, says Jason Holder","West Indies play their first Test match against England at Edgbaston. (Source: Reuters) West Indies play their first Test match against England at Edgbaston. (Source: Reuters)

West Indies are set to begin their three-match Test series against England at Edgbaston on Thursday. This would be the first day-night Test match which will be played in England and is also the first one for the home side. While Joe Root’s England will feature in maiden day-night Test, West Indies have already played one pink-ball Test previously. However, they lost that particular encounter.

In a report by cricket.com.au, West Indies captain Jason Holder has said that it has been their bowling which has carried them through in the last few Test matches. “I think our bowling has really carried us throughout the last few Test matches,” said Holder and added, “Shannon Gabriel has had a pretty decent year; I haven’t been doing too badly, and we’ve got young Alzarri Joseph and Miguel Cummins. Kemar Roach is actually showing some very, very good form – so I’m really confident in our bowling.”

Holder added that hosts England would come “pretty hard” and he wants his side to go back at them in the same way. “I don’t think there’s anything to spark that,” said Holder. “But we expect a good contest … the English come pretty hard, and we expect to go back just as hard at them,” insisted the skipper. “We’re obviously huge underdogs. We’ve got guys who are showing signs they can compete at Test level,” he said.

Talking about England, Holder suggested that they would be looking to create some extra pressure on the hosts to get some fruitful results.

“I think for us, it’s mainly just to make it as uncomfortable as possible for their senior players … and put some pressure on the junior guys who are coming in to make their mark,” said Holder.

Mentioning about the struggle that the West Indies batsmen have been facing, the Caribbean team slipper admitted that the batsmen need to chip in with some runs in order to produce some good results.

“It’s just for our batsmen to make some runs,” said Holder. “We’ve struggled in the past, primarily with our batting, but so far on this tour we’ve been doing really well,” added the captain.

(Andrew Milligan/PA via AP)

Britain’s most advanced and biggest warship, the 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, berthed for the first time at its home port of Portsmouth on Tuesday. The 280-metre (920-foot) vessel entered the harbour on England’s southern coast at 0610 GMT, greeted by thousands of spectators.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy, according to the Ministry of Defence. “Today we welcome our mighty new warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to her home for the very first time,” said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. “She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role.”

The ship is currently undergoing sea trials. It cannot yet deploy planes, but flying trials from its deck are due to begin in 2018. It took eight years to build HMS Queen Elizabeth, with construction taking place in six cities and involving 10,000 people.

Along with its sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, it is part of a defence programme worth 6 billion pounds ($7.65 billion). Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kyd told the BBC that the carrier “sends the right signals to our allies and indeed potentially to our enemies that we mean business.”

Long weekend getaways for 2017: Where are you going for Ganesh Chaturthi?,"Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Did you spend most of last year grumbling about how you didn’t get to travel much; how work pressure was too much and there wasn’t any time to take a break? Well then, let that not be an excuse for 2017, because this year has a whole host of long weekends (some you may need to work around, but then what are casual leaves and sick leaves for?) for you to make good use of. So far we’ve identified 14 of them, of which two (in August and October) can give you nine full days of vacation fun if only strategically add a couple of extra days.

We took inspiration from our own travels, added inputs from travel experts from Cleartrip, TravelTriangle, Travkart, Expedia, Skyscanner, etc., to come up with this. Check them out.

Hit the beach by going to Goa or Diu. The weather is perfect for water sports and fun. Love the snow? Then trek up to Auli or Parashar Lake for the weekend. You can even head to Dubai to catch the fag end of the Dubai shopping festival.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Goa for Mardi Gras, or towards Shimla and Fagu for a relaxing weekend in the hills.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to the hills for some chill time, and to catch a bit of snow if you’re lucky. Options could include Shimla’s outskirts or McLeodganj to the north, a hilly trek towards Malshej to the west, or even Puri or Digha in the east.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1/2

Where to go: Head to Singapore for some weekend fun. There is much to do and see, and the destination can be covered fairly well over four days.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1

Where to go: If you’re health conscious and a tad bit religious, then you could head towards Rishikesh for a Yoga retreat during this weekend. Or attend the Aoleang festival, held during the first week of April, along with the Konyak tribe in Nagaland.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you like nature and a bit of hiking, then head towards McLeodganj or a bit higher up towards Triund. It’s an easy hike for those who have never trekked before and gives you the most stunning views.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Orchha for a quick weekend trip, or Pondicherry or Coorg if you’re in southern India. This a good time to head to these places before summer comes by in full swing.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to places that are known for their non-vegetarian and Mughlai fare, such as Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 2/3

Where to go: If you take just two leaves, you have nine full days for a mini vacation, and the weather is perfect for a sojourn to Europe. Head to Eastern European countries such as Greece, Croatia, Hungary and Poland. There’s a lot to cover, and it works well for the budget traveller as well.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you plan really tight, this is the season to head to the Valley of flowers in Uttarakhand for a mini trek, and you can also go up to the Hemkund Sahib gurudwara, which is the highest gurudwara in the world.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you’re really fond of beer, then a quick visit to Munich for the Oktoberfest (on till October 3) may not be a bad idea. This is also a bucket list item for many, so why not! If you’re around Mumbai, then Karjat may be a viable option or if you want to head towards the North East then Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh is a great option. Though the music festival happens in September, you can always find local pubs with live music and there are, of course, some picturesque hiking trails.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 4

Where to go: Nine days is like a mini vacation, so make full use of it. October is a good month for a Vietnam-Cambodia trip, or just one of these countries, if you don’t want to rush it. Eastern Europe is also a good bet since it would be just before the severe winter sets in. In India, a trek through Spiti valley would give you stunning vistas to gorge upon, or if you haven’t been to Rajasthan yet, then a road trip is highly recommended.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Dhanaulti, Ranikhet, Mukteshwar, Manali, Binsar and Chakrata are all hill stations that would not only be a refreshing change, but also give stunning views of the snow-capped Himalayas. In southern India, Pondicherry or Kovalam are lovely seaside destinations worth considering.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Let’s face it, Goa is an obvious choice for this three-day weekend, and that’s for a reason. But if you’d rather not hit the crowded streets and beaches, and love snow then Manali and Rohtang Pass could be good options, even Auli is covered in white at this time of the year.

CBSE’s initiative helped 135 girls clear JEE Mains 2017,"Last year, the number of qualifying girl students was 143. (Representational image) Last year, the number of qualifying girl students was 143. (Representational image)

With the help of CBSE’s project Udaan, 135 girl students cracked the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Mains 2017 for admission in engineering colleges. The scheme was launched to fill the gap between school education and engineering entrance examination.

Under the scheme, girl students who score overall 70 per cent or above and 80 percent in science and mathematics stream get assistance from the government. The beneficiary receives free of cost tutorials, mentoring from teachers, lectures and study material to prepare for the engineering entrance examinations.

Moreover, CBSE also organised virtual contact classes in 60 designated cities. They also got support of helpline services to help them solve queries and monitor student learning. The project motivates meritorious girls towards further study of science and mathematics instead of soft subjects, it hand holds them and provides necessary training.

“The scheme relies on latest technology which gives ease of learning to a girl student without having to step out of her home on a daily basis. The study materials are pre-loaded on tablets and made convenient with mobile applications,” CBSE Chairman RK Chaturvedi said.

Last year, the number of qualifying girl students was 143. “It has seen that the participation of girl students in engineering entrance examinations as compared to boys is much lower. More than 75 percent of the registered candidates are boys. The idea is to mainstream girl students and prepare them for future leadership roles by removing social, economic or cultural constraints,” Chaturvedi said.

The scheme is limited for students from families with an annual income of less than Rs 6 lakh. Besides subject experts, students from IITs are also serving as mentors, and motivational tours to IIT Delhi are also arranged under the scheme.

To mitigate the gender gap, the Indian Institute of Technology has already introduced a special quota upto 20 percent for girl candidates.

Apache attack helicopters: Everything you need to know,"Apache helicopter used by the UK Army. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Apache helicopter used by the UK Army. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

The Defence Ministry on Thursday cleared a proposal to procure six Apache attack helicopters for the Indian army at a cost of Rs 4,168 crore. Said to be among one of world’s most advanced helicopters, AH-64 Apache is also used by the US Army among armed forces of other countries. Also known as Apache Guardian, this is a multi-role combat helicopter that can function smoothly in any weather and any point of time including night. The chopper is primarily designed to help the ground troops and is said to be ‘lethal’ when it comes to destroying enemy tankers.

Apache 64-A is a four-blade, twin-turboshaft helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite that makes target acquisition simpler. The laser, infrared, and other systems makes the helicopter capable of locating, tracking, and attacking targets. It also has a combination of laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles, 70mm rockets, and a 30mm automatic cannon with up to 1,200 high-explosive, dual-purpose ammunition rounds.

The attack helicopter has a maximum cruise speed of 284 km per hour. With a height of 15.24 ft and wing span of 17.15 ft, the helicopter has a flight speed of more than 150 knots. This implies that the helicopter can travel up to 279 kilometers per hour. The air-to-air missiles fitted in the chopper give it an edge over the other enemy helicopters. It also has a major systems redundancy to improve combat survivability. The AH-64E Apache has the ability to control unmanned aerial vehicles. The self-sealing fuel system in the chopper protects it against the loss of fuel, making it handy in case of a war. According to its maker Boeing, the AH 64 is capable of classifying and prioritizing of up to 128 targets in less than 60 seconds.

United States is the primary operator of Apache. The chopper is operational in other countries like Greece, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. India, initially had ordered 22 choppers in the month of September. The proposal for six choppers was finally cleared at a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley today.

Philippine troops to help cull thousands of fowl in bird flu battle,"Department of Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol holds a manual for Avian Influenza Protection during a news conference on the confirmation of the first bird flu case in the country Friday, Aug. 11, 2017 in Manila, Philippines.

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)

The Philippines will deploy hundreds of troops to hasten a cull of about 600,000 fowl, the farm minister said on Wednesday, as part of efforts to rein in the Southeast Asian nation’s first outbreak of bird flu. There has been no case of human transmission after the flu was detected on a farm in the province of Pampanga, about 75 km (47 miles) north of the capital Manila, but it has spread to about 36 other farms and nearly 40,000 birds have died.

“I have asked the Philippine army to provide us with additional warm bodies to help us in depopulating the farms,” Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol told a news conference.

“Six hundred thousand is no mean job. Our personnel are facing a difficult task and we lack people.”

Pinol said the government had about 200 men in the area, but fewer than 20,000 birds had been culled since the outbreak was reported.

Brigadier-General Rodel Mairo Alarcon said at least 300 soldiers would be sent to the province on Thursday to assist in the cull of chicken, quail and ducks.

“The Philippines army and the Armed Forces of the Philippines is 100 percent in support of this effort,” Alarcon said.

Soldiers will be given protective gear and doses of a drug, Tamiflu, to guard them against possible infection.

Two sick farm workers from the area have tested negative for the virus, health ministry spokesman Eric Tayag said.

Although the health ministry has yet to identify the specific strain of the virus that hit the Philippines, health and farm officials say initial tests have ruled out the highly pathogenic H5N1.

Samples are being sent to Australia for further testing to determine the presence of the N6 variety of the strain. The Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Africa and Europe and Africa to suffer the spread of bird flu viruses in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including deaths, in China.

Prisoner of the binary,"Hamid Ansari’s idea unveils his own perspective of the nation and nationalism, nurtured by Western narratives.

Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Hamid Ansari’s idea unveils his own perspective of the nation and nationalism, nurtured by Western narratives.Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal

The last Vice President of India Hamid Ansari’s observation just before he demitted office that “more recently, an alternative view point of purifying exclusivism has tended to intrude into and take over the political and cultural landscape” is an unconcealed attack on the ideological moorings of the RSS and the Narendra Modi government. However, it is nothing more than another unreasonably polemical expression of anti-RSSism as it remains unsubstantiated by evidence of discriminatory practices.

The RSS is not a new entity whose ideological tenets are unknown nor has the BJP assumed power in the country for the first time in 2014. Its predecessor, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), was instrumental in the formation of non -Congress governments in half a dozen provinces along with Ram Manohar Lohia’s socialists and also the Communist Party of India (CPI) in 1967. The the CPI justified camaraderie with the BJS “not as a sop” but based on “concrete programmes”. Since then, the political trajectory of the party includes coalition experiences with parties which have been ideologically opposed to it. From 2014 onwards, there has been a marked consolidation of saffron politics as India’s political executive is completely Congress-mukt — the offices of president, vice president and prime minister are held by RSS men.

The RSS is an ideologically driven movement which is more subaltern than any other group or idea. It believes that the masses, not disconnected elites, can change the destiny of a people. More than 1,60,000 social projects to empower the poor and marginalised are being run by RSS workers, including in Naxal and insurgency affected areas, without soliciting the support of big business or government. India’s biggest chain of schools run by Vidya Bharati belongs to the RSS. This is a small part of the social concern embedded in the ideological indoctrination of cultural nationalism which, according to Ansari, is an “illiberal form of nationalism” which promotes “intolerance and an arrogant patriotism”. This is a reactionary attack on the idea which has been the basis of India’s unity and the continuity of its civilisation. Ansari’s idea unveils his own perspective of the nation and nationalism, nurtured by Western narratives.

Sukumar Dutt understood the crisis of Indian intellectuals as early as 1926 when he aptly argued in Problem of Indian Nationality that “a mind free from (the) Western concept of nationality is absolutely necessary to comprehend the problems of Indian nationality.” The Western mind, averse to conflicts and with binaries of religion, language and cultures, defines nationalism as political and considers constitutionalism the guarantee for its perpetuation.

However this is not the case in India. The concept of nationalism can be traced from the prithvi sukt of the Atharva Veda which proclaims “the earth is our mother and we are her sons (mata bhoomi putroham prithivyah).” That is the reason humanitarian concern is embedded in India’s cultural nationalism and “otherness” is largely missing from its narratives. That is the reason cultural nationalism becomes a cradle for extremes and is classically accommodative. Ansari misses the spirit and message of the constituent assembly debate on secularism which is no different than the RSS’s perspective on secularism and nationalism. It is worth recalling the words of two members of the Constituent Assembly, Tajamul Hussain of Bihar, and H.C. Mukherjee, vice chairman of the assembly and a practising Christian.

Hussain said the concept of minority was incompatible in the Indian case as India’s history showed there had never been a tyranny of the majority. Mukherjee, on the other hand, warned the nation that acknowledging any community as a minority on the basis of religion would be detrimental to the objective of One People One Nation.

But post-Independence, India’s politics undermined the noble doctrine of One People One Nation and increasingly relied on Western definitions and experiences. Secularism and nationalism cannot be safeguarded only by enjoying privileges in the name of pluralism but not contributing to strengthening the idea of modernity and multiculturalism. It was intolerance toward Hindus when they faced demographic aggression by Semitic religions as part of the latter’s expansionism. Cultural nationalism is based on spiritual democracy which promotes pluralism, not obstructs it.

Cultural nationalism as an ideology had votaries even before the formation of the RSS — Aurobindo Ghose, B.C. Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lajpat Rai and many others. It reconnects modern India with its progressive ancient past and cultural and intellectual legacies. This idea was raised by Jawaharlal Nehru at the convocation at Aligarh Muslim University on January 24, 1948: “I have said that I am proud of our inheritance and our ancestors who gave an intellectual and cultural pre-eminence to India. How do you feel about this past? Do you feel that you are also sharers in it and inheritors of it and, therefore, proud of something that belongs to you as much as to me? Or do you feel alien to it and pass it by without understanding it or feeling that strange thrill which comes from the realisation that we are the trustees and inheritors of this vast treasure?”

But post-Independence India’s Muslim intellectuals escape this question and consider the role of people like Tajamul Hussain in the Assembly “as subversive to minority’s rights”. Hamid Ansari is a prisoner of the binary of majority and minority, which he assumes is essential to secularism and the RSS considers the binary an insult to the historical tradition of the nation. To quote Carlton Hayes “a nationality receives its impress, its character, its individuality from cultural and historical forces.” Ansari, by calling cultural nationalism illiberal, devalued the personality of the nation acquired over thousands of years.

Indonesia’s Bali holds tsunami drills for school students,"Students protect their heads as they run to a safe place during a tsunami drill at Tanjung Benoa school in Badung, Indonesia Bali resort island. (Source: Reuters) Students protect their heads as they run to a safe place during a tsunami drill at Tanjung Benoa school in Badung, Indonesia Bali resort island. (Source: Reuters)

Students scrambled to safety as sirens blared during a tsunami drill on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Tuesday, part of a campaign to prepare for disasters in the quake-prone country. Students at the Tanjung Benoa 2 elementary school took cover under their desks when the quake drill began, and then followed a tsunami evacuation route to the roof of a nearby hotel.

The exercise was part of a joint project by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Japan’s government to raise awareness among children in 18 Asia-Pacific nations. “Indonesia and Japan have the same high risk of natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunami … so it’s very reasonable that Indonesia is given priority in this project,” said Hirohisa Chiba, Japan’s consul general to Indonesia.

Indonesia was the country worst-hit in 2004 by an Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake. The province of Aceh on the northwest tip of Sumatra island bore the brunt of tsunami, with at least 168,000 killed. Huge tsunami waves slammed into Japan’s northeast coast in 2011, killing about 18,000 people and prompting authorities to revise warning systems and evacuation plans to save more lives.

‘Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food’: Sadia Dehlvi,"“My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,” Sadia Dehlvi says. “My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,” Sadia Dehlvi says.

Through the streets of Shahajahanabad, into the kitchen of some of the oldest families of Delhi, Sadia Dehlvi looks at the shape-shifter of a city that Delhi has come to be in her recent book Jasmine and Jinns. She talks of growing up in an extended Dilli family that lived in Shama Kothi on Sardar Patel Marg, the changes in the city’s palate over the years and giving Delhi one of its culinary stars – Al Kauser. Excerpts:

In the book, you trace your childhood through seasons and recipes telling us about a Delhi that once was. How did you narrow down on the idea?

Delhi has distinct seasons, and once upon a time lifestyles revolved around the weather. I would hear stories of how shopkeepers pulled down their shutters when the first rains arrived and went to Mehrauli for picnics with their families. Special dishes were made in the monsoon like Harimirch Qeema, Besani Roti and fresh Mango Chutney. Nihari was always associated with winter, and was eaten nihar muh, that is on an empty stomach. In winters, at home, every Sunday was ‘nihari day.’ We had it as early breakfast. Now people eat nihari all through the year and usually for lunch or dinner. It was traditionally referred to as gharib aadmi ka khana, and never served at weddings. Now nihari is a part of festive cuisine, even for us Dilliwalas.

In the summer, very little spice was used and I remember a variety of sherbets being made at home. These were mixed with barley water to keep us hydrated. Special chutneys were made with raw mango to save us from the severe heat. People in Delhi are exceedingly particular about taseer — inherent food properties and their effects on the body. I grew up relating to food in terms of halka (light), bhaari (heavy), garam (warm), or thanda (cold). Spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and peppercorns are believed to have garam taseer, and dishes which have these as ingredients are cooked mostly in winter. There is a hidden wisdom in such beliefs.

What are your first and most enduring memories of food?

My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta. In those days, ready to use spices were not used in most homes. When large parties were held at home, I recall professional cooks coming to the house, cooking in deghs with the meat and spices provided to them. Tandoors were dug in the house for fresh rotis. There was a separate area in the house of kuchi mitti for this kind of cooking. My grandfather was a gracious host, and Shama Kothi acquired the reputation of serving the city’s finest cuisine.

How did you choose the recipes for the book?

Most of these dishes are cooked in my home and in the kitchens of most Dilliwalas. Except for recipes of a few specialties cooked on festivals and weddings, the rest of the dishes are really a part of our day to day cooking. One does not require some exotic spices to make them. And since our food is dominated by seasons, that’s how I have divided the food sections. We usually cook almost all seasonal vegetables with meat. It’s not just a good way to balance the intake of meat and vegetables, but also to create a variety of wonderful dishes.

Shami Kebabs Shami Kebabs

You mention how Delhi’s palate changed with the arrival of the Mughals and then with the British. What are the changes you notice in Delhi’s food culture today?

The Mughal cuisine, that is Indo Persian, is probably the cuisine that best defines Delhi’s traditional non-vegetarian cuisine. Chillies were added to Delhi food in the 18th century on the advise of the city’s hakims after the water in the canal that ran through Chandni Chowk got polluted. It was a way to purge toxins from the body. This is what led to the creation of Delhi’s popular chaat. Delhi’s cuisine once comprised Jain, Bania and Muslim food. Then the British influenced the eating habits of the elite. More changes came after Partition, with the arrival of the Punjabis. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, choley bhaturey and dal makhani, came to typify Delhi food. But even that has changed, Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food. People from all over the country have made Delhi their home. So it’s now as much about dosa, momos, noodles as it is about biryani and qorma.

In the book, you mention how your mother wasn’t interested in kitchen chores. How do you think women’s relationship with food has changed?

My mother resented kitchen chores, because in those days women’s lives seemed to revolve around cooking. She rebelled against that idea and, luckily, she never really had to cook. She did other things and didn’t encourage me to cook either. Even now, she can’t understand my obsession with cooking. She tells me not to waste too much time in the kitchen. With so many women working, I think now cooking is not really looked at in a regressive way. Young working couples seem to order in or eat out so often. More and more young people are into health, and one has to cook right to eat right. With the internet, world cuisine has opened up and I meet so many young women who are experimenting with cooking various types of food. If you don’t look at cooking as a boring chore, it can be so much fun.

Family recipes were not shared earlier. But you believe in sharing them.

In older days, women or professional cooks never shared recipes. If they did, they would leave out a main ingredient so one could never get it right. I share family recipes because it gladdens my heart that they’ll bring cheer to people’s tables. Many of these have never travelled out of traditional Dilli homes. When friends come home for meals, they are surprised at the unusual combinations such as karela qeema, gajar salan, chuqandar gosht, bhindi salan that are regular fare for us.

How did Al Kauser come about?

I began Al Kauser with my mother in 1979. It was a small kiosk just opposite our house. After having lived a year in New York, I was very taken with the idea of street food. In those days, Delhi just had five star hotels and a few good restaurants, mostly in Connaught Place. Other than these, one had to go to old Delhi to eat kebabs. Al Kauser was the first road side kebab shop in New Delhi. It became quite a rage in the ’80s and ’90s. The kitchen was in our house. Entertaining in those years became so easy, as I could literally order a plate of kebab from my room. Now, street food is so much a part of Delhi culture.

Tell us the story behind the book’s title and the cover design.

Jasmine is the fragrance from my childhood. It was my grandmother’s favourite flower. We had jasmine shrubs in our gardens and I would help amma pluck them. In the summer, when we slept on the terrace, these were put on the charpais of the elders. The girls of the house were not allowed to wear jasmine flowers because amma said that jinns were attracted to young girls who wore jasmine. I also believe we had jinns that lived with us. In the evening, just before sunset, we had to stop playing in the gardens as amma said it was the time jinns ventured out. Throughout the 50 years we lived at Shama Kothi, we heard strange noises every night. So I guess my childhood was about Jasmine and Jinns. The cover idea by Shaaz Ahmed is old style story telling, with various elements from my childhood.

China said on Wednesday it hopes that India and the US can develop ties which are “conducive” to regional peace and development after the two countries agreed to enhance peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region by establishing a new two-by-two ministerial dialogue.

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to enhance peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region by establishing a new two-by-two ministerial dialogue, which would elevate their strategic consultations, according to the White House.

Trump spoke with Modi on Monday to greet him on the eve of India’s Independence Day.

Asked about the decision by the US and India to establish two-by-two ministerial dialogue, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, “We noticed relevant report. We hope India and US can develop relations which are conducive to regional peace and development.”

The decision to set up the new two-by-two ministerial dialogue comes amid China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region.

Surat jail inmates learn cutting and polishing of diamonds,"The diamond cutting and polishing centre was started on Thursday. (Representational image) The diamond cutting and polishing centre was started on Thursday. (Representational image)

The Surat district Jail authorities in association with a diamond firm, have started teaching cutting and polishing of rough diamonds to the prisoners. A diamond firm had installed two emery wheels in the jail where at present eight prisoners are learning cutting and polishing of diamonds. The step has been taken by the Jail superintendent H R Chaudhary, with the directors of Kohinoor diamonds. There are over 2200 prisoners in Central jail at Surat city.

Sources in the Surat district central jail said that the diamond firm directors had paid visit to the Lajpore Central Jail in Surat city twice, and put proposal to develop skill of cutting and polishing of rough diamonds to the prisoners, with an intention that if they are discharged from the jail, they can easily get work outside and can earn good money. Sources said that there are few prisoners in the jail who knew cutting and polishing of rough diamonds.

The diamond cutting and polishing centre was started on Thursday. Eight prisoners had showed interest to learn the skill and they are being taught by fellow prisoners and a diamond firm employee.

Jail authorities said that every day a single diamond supplied by the diamond firm, is given to the prisoner and he is told to work on making a tail portion or a head portion. After a whole day’s work, the diamond is returned back to the firm manager. The half-cut and polished diamonds are kept under lock and key in a safe room in the jail. The diamond firm employee also keeps the details of stock of rough diamonds and polished diamonds.

One of the director of Kohinoor diamonds, Bharat Gajera, said, “The diamond stock is being sent to the jail by our manager who gives the diamonds to prisoners and takes it back in the evening from them. He also teaches the prisoners art of cutting and polishing of diamonds. The prisoners are also happy with this attempt. During our previous visit to the jail authorities, many prisoners had shown interest to cut and polish diamonds. If we get good results we will increase the number of emery wheels. The prisoners will get payment of labour charges, similar to the labour charges we are giving to our diamond polishers working in our factory.”

Lajpore Jail superintendent H R Chaudhary said, “Surat is known as diamond, textile and jari city. We have started many programs of developing skills among the prisoners, with an intention that once they get out from jail, they can work and earn money and not fall into criminal activities. We have already started power-loom machines. Cutting and polishing of diamonds was lacking and after Kohinoor diamond firm directors approached us with a proposal, we agreed. The diamond firm will supply raw materials (rough diamonds) and prisoners will cut and polish it. At present the diamond firm employees are teaching the art of cutting and polishing to the prisoners, while few of the prisoners also knew this art. They too have joined. We are getting a good response from the prisoners, and they have showed interest to learn this art.”

Lack of generosity from spouse drives women to be unfaithful: Survey,"As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images) As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images)

Once the wooing stage is over and the couple has settled down, some men become far less generous and downright stingy. This leads to most women becoming unfaithful to their partners, according to a survey. Gleeden, a European dating site for married individuals, catering to people seeking affairs outside their relationships, conducted a research on 5,000 Indian women users of the dating site who belong to the age group of 23-35 years.

According to the study, married women do not ask to be showered with gifts, but they do appreciate being looked after and valued. As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue.

Most women link infidelity to the lack of generosity from their husbands. Around 69 per cent women think that the lack of sweet words, tenderness, small gestures and initiatives is because their spouse is cheating on them or is in the process.

To explain their own infidelity as a result of their spouse’s ignorant behaviour, 39 per cent of the women members stated that it was their need to feel valued.

Around 29 per cent women admitted their self-esteem is hurt when their spouse does not make sufficient effort. Over a quarter of them declared that stinginess has suppressed their desire for their spouse, and that they consider this defect to be a real romance killer.

“We are delighted to see the increasing number of Indian users in our site and how encounters outside marriage is no more a taboo or something to be shy about in India. In this survey, we have seen what could be the reason for the women to move out from their marital bond to find new encounters,” Solène Paillet, head of communications and a manager at Gleeden, said in a statement.

“The company’s aim is not only to bring members together but to anticipate their expectations and needs and providing them with reliable content, a high-quality interface and many innovative services and I believe, this survey gave us a ray of hope to provide more tempting services to our users,” Paillet added.

"Note ban figures: Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad asks who’s right, PM or RBI?","Gulam Nabi Azad Gulam Nabi Azad

ALLEGING THAT the Sangh Parivar is engaged in “Bharat todo” (breaking India) even as the Prime Minister, in his Independence Day address, appealed to people to embrace the slogan “Bharat jodo” (unite India), the Congress Wednesday questioned Narendra Modi’s claims on the post-demonetisation figures he provided to the nation.

The Prime Minister had Tuesday said that according to research by independent experts, about Rs 3 lakh crore which had never entered the banking system has now been brought into the system after demonetisation. Besides, more than Rs 1.75 lakh crore deposited in banks is under the scanner.

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Wednesday asked, “How much money has returned to the banking system after demonetisation is a question that was asked of the government in Parliament. We were then told that the RBI has told the government that counting is in progress. The RBI has issued a separate statement that the counting has not been completed.

“When RBI has not completed counting, where did the Prime Minister get this figure of Rs 3 lakh crore from? How is the Prime Minister saying that more than Rs 1.75 lakh crore black money has come into the banking system?”

He also asked, “If this information is with the Prime Minister, why didn’t he share this information in Parliament when we asked for it? There is a huge question both the Prime Minister and the RBI have to answer to the nation: Who is lying?”

About Modi’s “Bharat jodo” slogan, Azad said, “Mr Prime Minister… tell your Sangh Parivar to stop breaking India. India is united on its own….”

Liverpool survive missed penalty to win in Hoffenheim,"Liverpool took a two away goals advantage after beating Hoffenheim in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League playoff. (Source: Reuters) Liverpool took a two away goals advantage after beating Hoffenheim in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League playoff. (Source: Reuters)

Teenager Trent Alexander-Arnold curled in a magnificent free kick on his European debut to set Liverpool on the way to a 2-1 win at Hoffenheim which put them on the brink of Champions League group stage place on Tuesday.

Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet saved an early penalty and James Milner’s shot was deflected into his own net by Havard Nordtveit for the English Premier League side’s second goal in an end-to-end match.

An astonishing last-minute own goal by Young Boys defender Kasim Nuhu handed CSKA Moscow a 1-0 away win while Sporting were held to a goalless draw at home by FCSB, formerly Steaua Bucharest, in two of the other Champions League playoff ties.

Alexander-Arnold, 18, who only made his Premier League debut in December, curled a free kick through a gap in the Hoffenheim wall 10 minutes before halftime as Liverpool survived a rocky start.

It could have been very different if Andrej Kramaric had converted a penalty for the Bundesliga side in the 12th minute but he saw a weak effort saved by Mignolet.

Liverpool had another let-off just before halftime when Mignolet saved from Kramaric and Wagner rolled the rebound wide of the post.

Hoffenheim, attempting to qualify for the group stage for the first time, had more possession but Liverpool were more threatening and went further ahead in the 77th minute.

The hosts lost possession trying to play their way out of defence, the ball was switched to substitute James Milner on the left and his shot from a narrow angle deflected off Nordtveit’s chest and into the top corner.

Mark Uth pulled one back with three minutes left, chesting the ball down and drilling a low shot into the corner of the net, and Hoffenheim should have equalised in stoppage time but Benjamin Huebner sent a free header over the bar.

“It was a little dangerous in the first half, but as always when we play football, we found spaces in between and created wonderful chances,” said Livepool manager Jurgen Klopp.

“The result is OK. The first half is done and if you said before the game we would win, I would take the result… Only the person who does not know about Hoffenheim can be surprised by this.”

Young Boys dominated the second half against CSKA yet the Swiss ended up losing after an almost comical own goal.

A long ball was cleared into the Young Boys half which Nuhu headed into the air.

The Ghanaian then tried to head the ball back to goalkeeper David Von Ballmoos but instead it flew over the stranded keeper and bounced agonisingly inside the post and into the net as he tried desperately to claw it away.

Minutes earlier, CSKA goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev made a superb reflex effort to tip Guillaume Horau’s shot over the bar.

FCSB, European champions in 1986 in their old guise as Steaua, held out fairly comfortably against an uninspired Sporting despite having Mihai Pintilii sent off with 10 minutes left for a second bookable offence.

The Romanians, runners-up in their league last season, could even have snatched a win as Gabriel Enache and Junior Morais both went close in the second half.

Azeri champions Qarabag beat FC Copenhagen 1-0 and APOEL Nicosia were 2-0 winners at home to Slavia Prague in the evening’s other ties.

"Nearly 1,800 goose eggs destroyed to stop plane strikes","Belfast City Airport has said it has a legal obligation to control the number of greylag geese for safety reasons. (File Photo) Belfast City Airport has said it has a legal obligation to control the number of greylag geese for safety reasons. (File Photo)

Almost 1,800 greylag goose eggs have been destroyed at a park in east Belfast since 2002 to prevent birds from being sucked into the engines of aircraft, authorities in Northern Ireland have said. Victoria Park is close to the George Best Belfast City Airport and planes fly directly overhead. BBC News in Northern Ireland obtained the data through a freedom of information request to the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.

Belfast City Airport has said it has a legal obligation to control the number of greylag geese for safety reasons. The eggs are destroyed through a process known as egg-pricking, the BBC reported. During this process the shell is pricked and injected with oil. This prevents the embryo from developing into a chick and hatching, it said. The parent geese continue to sit on the eggs and therefore will not lay any more. The airport said the method was the most humane way to manage the population of geese, adding that no adult geese had been culled. If a bird flies into a plane engine, it can damage the mechanics and a few planes have been brought down as a result of such bird strikes, the report said.

In a freedom of information request the Northern Ireland environment agency revealed that since 2002, a total of 1,775 greylag goose eggs had been oiled and pricked. The numbers involved vary each year, ranging from fewer than 50 to more than 250. In recent years, an average of 100 eggs have been pricked. A spokesman for the airport said: “In order to control the feral geese population in Victoria Park, the oiling and pricking of eggs is undertaken by a biologist under licence from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and with the permission of Belfast City Council.

A spokesperson for the council said: “Public health and safety is paramount to Belfast City Council. “Due to concerns over the number of greylag geese in Victoria Park, and their potential threat to landing or taking off aircraft at George Best Belfast City Airport, Belfast City Council has an agreement with the airport granting them access to Victoria Park to carryout egg pricking,” the spokesperson said.

Dance Like a Man,"A scene from Netua A scene from Netua

In the village of Buxar in Bihar, where theatre director Dilip Gupta grew up, a wedding or a social celebration almost always included a dance by a woman who was actually a man. “The tradition was called launda naach or the netua naach. As children, we were fascinated by these normal-looking boys who would go into a room and emerge from it looking like women. We would peep from cracks in doors and open windows as he dressed up,” says Gupta. Earlier this month, the theatre director enlivened the story of these men who performed as women dancers in a play, titled Netua.

Who would watch a play about folk dancers from Bihar in the heart of Delhi? More than Shri Ram Centre in Mandi House could accommodate. Long after the curtain rose and the doors shut, the crowd kept growing outside the hall. The enterprising among them tried to look for secret entrances — up the steps that lead to the Green Room — or called “people inside”. Neither scheme worked. Netua was house full, with standing room near the walls and in the balcony taken. The air-conditioning barely managed to keep up.

Dilip Gupta Dilip Gupta

The play begins with a netua performer, called Jhamna, refusing to let his son join the profession. His reason forms the body of the script, and allows actor Raunak Khan to get under the skin of a dancer, who clings to his art even as people around him, especially a zamindar, become incapable of seeing him as a man. The exploitation — sexual and social — of the zamindar increases but Jhamna holds his ground until a terrible incident forces him to cast away his coloured skirt. The dances are energetic and the music evocative of the heartland but Netua suffers from uneven acting and tacky light design. Performers maintained the momentum of the play, and kept the audience applauding.

Gupta knows the terrain in which the play is set, and recreates the raw and rough. Netua also demonstrates the immersion of an artist into his character. Gupta’s past plays have included Urf Chocolate Friends, about migration, and Bathan, about caste politics and naxalite problems, among others. In Netua, a Saraswati Puja scene depicts a bhajan performed to the tune of a yesteryear Bollywood hit. A native of the region would recognise how folk music is increasingly being juxtaposed with film tunes.

In a major setback to former chief minister Ashok Chavan, five Congress corporators from the Nanded Municipal Corporation have defected to the ruling BJP. Five Shiv Sena corporators and three NCP corporators also joined the BJP. Nanded is the home town of Chavan.

The state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve inducted the 13 corporators from Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP into the BJP. Nanded Municipal Corporation polls are scheduled for September 2017.

Commenting on the development, Chavan said, “In the party there are some “dal badlus” or turn coats. These five corporators who left Congress to join BJP belong to that category. Their going to BJP does not make any difference to the Congress.”

In the 2012 Nanded Municipal Corporation, Congress was in power being a leading party. The Nanded Municipal Corporation has 81 seats. In the last elections, Congress won 41 seats, Shiv Sena 14, NCP 10 and BJP 2 seats.

71st Independence Day: CM Devendra Fadnavis promises to free farmers of loans,"The CM at Mantralaya’s I-Day celebration. Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar The CM at Mantralaya’s I-Day celebration. Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Tuesday reiterated his stand that loan waiver was not a long-lasting solution to farmers’ problems, even as he said his government was working towards freeing all farmers of debts.

“The government has given a Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver to 89 lakh farmers. But we are not going to seek solace and rest. It cannot provide permanent satisfaction. We will continue to strive to make farmers loan free forever, which would require greater empowerment and sustainable agriculture practices through scientific approach and higher capital investments in the sector,” he said after hoisting the national flag at Mantralaya.

In his Independence Day address, the CM called upon the people to work towards making a “modern Maharashtra”.

Fadnavis said the government would build 12 lakh houses in rural and 10 lakh houses in urban areas under affordable housing project by 2019. “We have started work on 3 lakh houses,” he said.

Listing the achievements of his government, the CM said, “Maharashtra is the first state that has set up a separate ministry for the OBCs. In the last two-and-a half years, we have introduced several social and economic schemes for the OBCs. Under the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj scheme, we have provided Rs 1,200-crore scholarships to economically backward students. The state has included 605 new courses under the scheme to help students representing Maratha and other communities almost on the lines of OBCs.”

Based on the theme of freedom, Fadnavis administered seven pledges to the gathering. Making farmers free from debt by providing loan waiver and higher investments in agriculture, making all drought-prone villages water reliant through Jalyukta Shivar, planting 5 lakh trees to help tackle pollution and working towards making Swachh Bharat Mission a success were some of them.

He praised the Centre’s move to introduce Goods and Services Tax, and said the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act would give people freedom from corrupt builders.

"I have legal right over Poes Garden, says Deepa as CM Palaniswami decides to make it Jayalalithaa’s memorial","Deepa Jayakumar (Source: ANI) Deepa Jayakumar (Source: ANI)

Hours after Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi K Palaniswami made the announcement of transforming J Jayalalithaa’s residence into a memorial, former chief minister’s niece Deepa Jayakumar on Thursday said the government had no right to make such declarations without consulting her and her brother.

Deepa also added that the property belonged to her and her brother Deepak and hence, they are the legal heir. “They have no right to announce this without consulting legal heirs, that is me and my brother. I have moral, ethical and legal right over this house,” she was quoted as saying by ANI.

Veda Nilayam, the residence of Jayalalithaa was occupied by her till her hospitalisation in September last year. Post her death, her close aid, V K Sasikala lived there until she was jailed in a disproportionate assets case. Both Deepa and Deepak have been constantly trying to cement themselves as Amma’s true heir after Jayalalithaa’s death. She had also tried to stake claim over Amma’s assets.

Recently, Deepa and her supporters had staged a protest outside Poes Garden, alleging that she was assaulted and denied entry into the residence by the supporters of TTV Dhinakaran. Incidentally, her brother Deepak was present in the house when she arrived. Poes Garden, which is unoccupied now was thrown open to the public for a

while earlier this year, but was soon closed down.

Apart from turning the house into a memorial open for public, the Tamil Nadu government also announced a commission that would re-investigate the death of Jayalalithaa. Both the announcements were major demands raised by OPS and his supporters and come amid the reports of a proposed merger between two AIADMK factions led by Panneerselvam and Palaniswami. OPS had also launched a signature campaign to turn Veda Nilayam into a memorial, which received a good response from the public.

Vivegam trailer: Witness Thala Ajith rise like a phoenix,"Ajith’s Vivegam is all set to hit screens on August 24. Ajith’s Vivegam is all set to hit screens on August 24.

Following his regular practice, director Siva unveiled the first extensive theatrical trailer for his upcoming film Vivegam, starring Thala Ajith, at midnight on Thursday. And in about 9 hours, the trailer has already crossed more than one million views on YouTube. It is one of the indications of the popularity and the expectations the film carries among the movie goers.

Editor Ruben, who seems to understand the pulse of Ajith fans, has cut an interesting trailer that shows the rise, fall and the rise of the protagonist. Ajith plays an international agent and a head of an anti-terror organisation. The film follows his missions and his struggles to defeat his enemies.

Judging by the trailer, Vivek Oberoi becomes a rogue agent and begins to hunt his former friend, Ajith. Vivek plays the main antagonist in the film, which marks his debut in Tamil. Kajal Aggarwal plays Ajith’s wife, while Akshara Haasan has made a blink-and-miss appearance in the trailer.

The trailer is dedicated to showing the attitude of Ajith’s character, which is he will move mountains or die trying. He is beaten again and again but yet he keeps bouncing back. This reminds us of Siva’s interaction with Ajith. When Siva narrated the action-packed story of Vivegam, Ajith was on crutches. In 2015, he had to undergo a knee surgery due to the injury he suffered on the sets of Vedalam. Looking at his condition, Siva had his doubts as to how can Ajith pull off this role, which required him to perform a lot of stunts. But, Ajith bounced back and even went an extra mile by building a ripped physique to everyone’s surprise for the role.

The trailer also gives a taste of cinematographer Vetri’s work. The picturesque locations and fog-filled landscapes are a treat to sore eyes. The majority of the shooting took place in European locations, and that’s the main reason why it cost more than Rs 100 crore for the producers to make this film.

Composer Anirudh Ravichander’s background score is just icing on the cake. The music album has already become a big hit.

Vivegam is the biggest film in Ajith’s career, in terms of its budget and expectations around it. The film is due in theaters on August 24.

All for a good cause: This cafe in Australia charges male customers 18 per cent ‘man tax’,"The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter) The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter)

If you are in Melbourne, Australia and happen to look for a vegan cafe, then you can head to Handsome Her. But if you’re a man, be prepared to end up paying more than the female customers. Yes, the cafe levies a surcharge on male customers, but there’s a powerful message behind it.

No one likes paying more taxes based on their gender, right? Then how are people okay with the pay gap based on gender? It’s a known fact that around the world there is a big difference in the remuneration received by men and women. From entertainment industry to big enterprises, many are guilty of practising the vice.

The ‘man tax’ paid at this cafe is to highlight the disparities in pay scale. The male customers are expected to pay a surcharge fixed at 18 per cent but it’s not compulsory or asked every day. The additional cost is levied only once a week, per month.

The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien. She says her restaurant is ‘for women, by women’ but men are always welcome. The main motive behind this move is to start a conversation over the issue of gender equality in the workplace. Talking to the Daily Mirror, O’Brien said, “If men don’t want to pay it, we’re not going to kick them out the door. It’s just an opportunity to do some good.”

She describes herself as a “feminist, not the fun kind”, and added: “We’re bringing it [the gender pay gap] to the forefront of people’s minds. I like that it is making men stop and question their privilege a little bit.”

According to the report by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which used Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2016, it stated that the full-time gender pay gap is around 18 per cent. And no, the extra earning is not stashed away, it is donated to charities.

“Alex plans to rotate them four times a year. In August, the earnings will go to an organisation called Elizabeth Morgan House, which helps Aboriginal women and children,” the report added.

Many have praised her for her meaningful initiative.

"Hindu, Jewish women marry in UK’s first interfaith gay wedding","A Hindu woman and her Jewish partner married in the UK in what is believed to be the country’s first interfaith lesbian wedding. (Source: Youtube/@Pukaarnews) A Hindu woman and her Jewish partner married in the UK in what is believed to be the country’s first interfaith lesbian wedding. (Source: Youtube/@Pukaarnews)

A Hindu woman and her Jewish partner have married in the UK in what is believed to be the country’s first interfaith lesbian wedding, according to media reports. Kalavati Mistry, 48, and Miriam Jefferson, who is from Texas, met more than 20 years ago on a training course in the US, and tied the knot last week.

During the ceremony, the brides wore traditional red and white bridal colours, fresh floral garlands and a ‘mangal sutra’ (a necklace traditionally tied around the bride’s neck) to show that they are now married women.

Mistry had kept her sexuality a secret for years and said it had been “very difficult for me as an Asian gay woman”, The Independent reported.

From a young age, Mistry knew she was gay but was worried about telling her friends and family and honouring the traditions of her culture and religion.

She admits their reaction to her partner has been great.

But her friends and family have been “welcoming and embracing” to Jefferson since she disclosed their relationship, she said, adding: “I hope many many gay people -no matter what religion or culture they’re in – are in loving relationships.”

Local Hindu female priest, Chanda Vyas carried out the ceremony and said she was delighted to be part of the event.

The couple, who both work for an interfaith organisation, married at the Chutney Ivy restaurant in Leicester, England.

Jefferson said that they had already had a Jewish wedding in her hometown of San Antonio, Texas, earlier this year.

“It’s really nice to now have a Hindu wedding here, because it brings both of us together and completes both of us in my eyes,” she said. The couple will return to the US after the wedding.

China regains spot as largest foreign US creditor,"Representational Image Representational Image

China purchased the most Treasuries in six years in June, vaulting past Japan as the largest overseas lender to the US government, possibly taking advantage of recent weakness in the dollar in a rising US interest rate environment. Tuesday’s report from the US Treasury Department also signaled that China has steadily ratcheted up its accumulation of US government debt as it has burned far less of its foreign exchange reserves this year to defend the yuan currency.

In 2016, China spent nearly $320 billion of foreign exchange reserves in an effort to stem the yuan’s depreciation against the US dollar. In the wake of tighter capital controls and a weaker dollar so far this year, China’s forex reserves, the world’s biggest, have grown in line with its Treasuries holdings.

In June, China’s Treasuries holdings rose to $1.147 trillion, which was the highest level since September when it was $1.157 trillion. And in July, China’s currency reserves reached a nine-month peak at $3.081 trillion. “They may have reshuffled their portfolio a little bit and sold a few things. Maybe they think the dollar is attractive now and they increased those (Treasuries) holdings,” said Kevin Lai, chief economist Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.

The overall increase in reserves was due to weakness in the dollar, which has helped push up the value of non-dollar currencies in its holdings, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said last week. Indeed, the People’s Bank of China remains a net seller of foreign currency, though net sales narrowed sharply to 4.647 billion yuan ($694.93 million) in July, according to central bank data on Wednesday.

The recent increase in Treasury holdings possibly also reflects an incentive to by US-dollar denominated assets amid rising US interest rates. The pullback in the dollar over recent months allowed for a relatively cheaper entry point. Before China returned to being the largest US overseas lender, Japan had held that spot for eight months. Japan held $1.091 trillion in US government debt in June, down from $1.111 trillion in May.

Japan’s drop in Treasuries holdings was the steepest since November, falling to a level last seen in December. Ireland was a distant third in holdings of Treasuries, with $302.5 billion in June, up from $295.8 billion in May.

Overall, foreign investors bought $19.73 billion in Treasuries in June, down from $46.37 billion in May, which was the most since June 2015. While there was speculation in recent years that China would use its massive Treasuries holdings to exert pressure on the United States, there has been little indication of that happening, even amid rising tensions between the two countries on issues ranging from trade to North Korea.

“The PBOC’s primary motivation is to manage the fx reserves in a way that makes sure they are held in safe and liquid investments and that they make a decent rate of return”, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “I don’t think the primary motivations are going to be political.”

"Philippe Coutinho still injured, no attitude problem, says Juergen Klopp","Philippe Coutinho is targeted by Barcelona. Philippe Coutinho is targeted by Barcelona.

Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho, who is a target for Barcelona, has not recovered from a back injury and will miss Saturday’s Premier League match against Crystal Palace, manager Juergen Klopp said.

Coutinho, who submitted a transfer request last week according to British media reports, missed Liverpool’s 3-3 draw at Watford last Saturday and the first leg of their Champions League playoff, a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim on Tuesday.

“Phil is not available. Not in training so far,” Klopp told reporters on Thursday, adding that he had nothing negative to say about the player’s attitude.

Barcelona’s sporting manager Pep Segura said on Wednesday that the Spanish club were “close” to signing Coutinho, despite Liverpool’s manager and owners saying the 25-year-old is not for sale. Klopp said on Thursday that nothing had changed with their stance.

“I don’t know why other people are saying what they’re saying (about Coutinho moving to Barcelona). I don’t even know him (Segura). I have never met him,” Klopp said.

“We are not silly, we know it is a very difficult situation – but there’s nothing new to say. It’s not always easy for me to say the 100 percent truth… But this time this is the situation.”

Liverpool have had a relatively quiet transfer window compared to many of their rivals, signing defender Andrew Robertson, winger Mohamed Salah and striker Dominic Solanke.

They have been linked in British media with moves for Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and midfielder Naby Keita from RB Leipzig, but both players’ clubs have said they are not for sale at any price.

Fans have expressed frustration with Liverpool’s failure to invest further in a squad that finished fourth in the Premier League last season, but Klopp said that he was happy with the players he has already.

“The whole market is difficult,” Klopp said. “If the transfer window had ended yesterday we already have a team I like. The transfer window is a very important time, but it’s also important what we do with the actual team.”

The manager said striker Daniel Sturridge, who sustained a thigh injury in pre-season, is fit to return for Liverpool’s first home game of the season, which could prove a tough encounter.

Palace, who lost their opening match 3-0 at home to promoted Huddersfield, could become the first side to win four straight Premier League matches at Anfield.

“I am really looking forward to Anfield. It’s our place. It’s been a long time since we played there,” Klopp said. “We know it is a tough game. Probably both teams not overly happy (with their first games).”

"Japan to seek assurance of U.S. defence pledge, including nuclear deterrence","Japan’s Minister of Defence, Itsunori Onodera, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Taro Kono, travel to the U.S. capital this week for “two-plus-two” meetings with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis(above) and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Japanese government announced on Tuesday. (File) Japan’s Minister of Defence, Itsunori Onodera, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Taro Kono, travel to the U.S. capital this week for “two-plus-two” meetings with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis(above) and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Japanese government announced on Tuesday. (File)

Japan’s defence chief and foreign minister will meet their U.S. counterparts on Thursday to reaffirm Washington’s commitment to defending Japan, including the use of its nuclear deterrent, as threats from North Korea intensify. Japan’s Minister of Defence, Itsunori Onodera, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Taro Kono, travel to the U.S. capital this week for “two-plus-two” meetings with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Japanese government announced on Tuesday.

The meetings come with tensions high in East Asia with North Korea threatening to fire missiles into the waters close to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. The missiles would have to fly over Japan to reach their target worrying Tokyo that warheads or missile debris could fall on its territory. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned of “fire and fury” if North Korea threatens the United States, and said the U.S. military is “locked and loaded”.

“The strategic environment is becoming harsher and we need to discuss how we will respond to that,” a Japanese foreign ministry official said in a briefing in Tokyo. “We will look for the U.S. to reaffirm it defence commitment, including the nuclear deterrent,” he added. Under Japan’s alliance treaty with the United States, Washington has pledged to defend Japan. It has put Japan under its nuclear umbrella, meaning it could respond to any attack on Japan with atomic weapons.

A renewed commitment by Washington to that promise would reassure Tokyo as it looks to bolster its defences against possible North Korean military action.

"Expect James Anderson to play a big part in Australia, says Stuart Broad","James Anderson is expected to play a big part in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. (Source: AP) James Anderson is expected to play a big part in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. (Source: AP)

England fast bowler, Stuart Broad has backed fellow seamer James Anderson to play a big part during the upcoming Ashes Test series. Anderson, who is heading towards the fag end of his career, has seen a lot of questions being raised over the past few weeks over his efficiency in the Australian tour.

Speaking to the reporters, Broad, said,”I’m very confident. The last couple of years he’s averaging 14 or 15 with the ball in England, so we know how dangerous he is when the ball’s moving around like that. But when we go to Australia, the wobble seam he bowls is a great weapon to have in Australia – take (Australia’s) Stuart Clark as an example. We’re certainly fortunate to have him going strong and I certainly expect him to play a big part in Australia.

Responding to a query as to whether Anderson would play the role of a coach as well, Broad said, “That was suggested really sarcastically by Jimmy in the changing room,” said Broad. “It would be a tough one for him because he’d have to mit to himself in the mornings which wouldn’t be easy! Jimmy is almost a bit of a bowling coach anyway with his great experience.”

Together Broad and Anderson have led the English pace attack from the front for a considerable period of time and claimed more than 700 wickets together. Commenting on the partnership Broad revealed he would love to continue it for long and hoped they would scalp 1000 wickets between themselves. “It’d be pretty special, but we’d have to see how long the old bloke (Anderson) wants to go on for. I’ve been lucky to bowl at the other end to him and I know if I hadn’t done, I wouldn’t have as many wickets as I have got.”

Narayana Murthy shares concern of CEA over lack of reliable job data,"FILE PHOTO: Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys Limited REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo FILE PHOTO: Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys Limited REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo

Infosys Co-Founder Narayana Murthy on Thursday endorsed Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian’s concern over lack of reliable jobs data which has thrown up big challenges before the central government to solve unemployment problem. “I entirely agree with the Chief Economic Advisor, Mr Arvind Subramanian. He has already recognised the problem that data on jobs is not accurate. This is an important and an essential first step to address an issue,” he told reporters on the sidelines of inauguration of Synergetic Security operation Centre of SISA, a payment security specialist, here.

“I believe once somebody is in a position has recognised the problem – the problem of lack of reliable jobs data, I am sure the government will be in a position to solve employment problem,” he added. According to media reports, the government has kicked off a new employment survey to create closer-to-real-time credible information, the first tranche of which is expected to be revealed in December next year.

“The data thus collected will help government and companies to make analysis as to what are the areas where we have higher unemployment – in which all states it is high, and which all states it is low, and automatically, we will find out what kind of encouragement we need to give to entreprenuers to create jobs, in certain parts of the country and sectors of the economy,” Murthy said. Murthy also said he listens to Subramanian with tremendous attention and care, of whatever he says, because he is a learned and highly qualified person.

Asked if such genuine data would become a cause of embarrassment for companies who were negating huge number of job losses, Murthy said it should not (not) worry them. “We should not worry about who gets embarrassed, who doesn’t. That is not the important thing. I wouldn’t worry,” he said. Responding to a query, Murthy said the day a company loses transparency, the business would begin to climb down.

“Business may go up and down but what is important is the values cannot go up and down. Transparency, fairness and accountability are the most important attributes of any corporation. The day you lose transparency, then, I believe, that’s the day your business starts going down,” Murthy said.

Everton have agreed a deal to sign Swansea City’s Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson for a fee of about 45 million pounds ($57.89 million), British media reported on Tuesday.

Sigurdsson, 27, played a key part in Swansea avoiding relegation last season, scoring nine goals while his 13 assists was the third best total in the Premier League.

The BBC reported that Sigurdsson would have a medical at Swansea’s fellow top-flight club Everton on Wednesday. British media reported that Everton had two bids rejected for Sigurdsson, with Swansea wanting 50 million pounds.

Sigurdsson, who spent two years at Tottenham Hotspur before joining Swansea, where he had a spell on loan from Hoffenheim in 2012, would be Everton’s record signing, beating the 31.8 million pounds they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.

Belgium striker Lukaku joined Manchester United in July for a fee of 75 million pounds according to British media.

"Chandigarh Civic chief slaps Rs 5,000 fine on safai kendras for littering","Purushartha visited the Sehaj Safai Kendras of sectors 21, 35 and 17 Purushartha visited the Sehaj Safai Kendras of sectors 21, 35 and 17

FINDING GARBAGE littered around at three Sehaj Safai Kendras (SSKs) in the city, Municipal Corporation Commissioner Baldeo Purushartha slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 each on the guardians of cleanliness – the supervisors of SSKs – exactly the same charge which residents who litter would have to pay.

Residents of the city, who dump garbage, will have to pay recovery charges of Rs 5,000 for littering. Since the notification has been issued and just the charges, approved by the House, have to be formally okayed, the commissioner got challans issued and imposed a fine of the same charge on the employees for “littering”.

Purushartha visited the Sehaj Safai Kendras of sectors 21, 35 and 17 when he found garbage flooding out of the kendras.

Talking to Chandigarh Newsline, the commissioner confirmed the development and said that the challans of Rs 5,000 have been imposed on the employees “for not carrying out their duty properly which is to maintain cleanliness”. He said, “No laxity with respect to unclean environment would be digested be it any violator.”

The officer added that further action would be taken if the employees continued to maintain an unclean environment. Lauding the move, councillors said this step sends out a clear message to city residents indulging in littering.

“The step taken is exemplary indeed. This is like a clear message to city residents that when MC’s own employees are not being spared, no person indulging in keeping unclean environment would be spared,” said councillor Devinder Singh Babla.

BJP councillor Davesh Moudgil said, “For the betterment of the city, it is really important that those people who have to get the rules for littering implemented on people, should themselves obey it first. The condition of Sehaj Safai Kendras was really bad as garbage is overflowing and stray dogs further litter it around.”

The Sehaj Safai Kendras are located in almost every sector. Once the garbage is collected from the residents by the door-to-door garbage collectors, it first goes to the Sehaj Safai Kendras. From here, the garbage is then taken to the garbage processing plant by the garbage collection vehicles.

For residents indulging in littering, the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has decided that other than the usual fine of Rs 500, people would have to shell out recovery charges. If garbage is being dumped by the owner of a house, he would have to shell out Rs 5,000 as recovery charges while the owner of a commercial outlet would have to pay Rs 10,000. The amount would be recovered for the additional labour and machinery deployed by the MC to clear the littered garbage.

The right-wing Israeli leader welcomed Trump’s Republican presidency after having had a testy relationship with his predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat who often pressured him over settlement building in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has appeared reluctant to be seen as criticising Trump.

“Guess which world leader took even longer than Trump to condemn neo-Nazism and even then couldn’t even specify where he was referring to,” Anshel Pfeffer of the left-wing Haaretz newspaper wrote on Twitter. An Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity that although the premier did not name Charlottesville it was the violence there to which he was referring.

During the white supremacist rally there, marchers carried swastika banners and chanted Nazi-era slogans. “Netanyahu’s silence in the face of images that send chills down the spines of Jews worldwide has raised eyebrows among analysts and experts,” the Times of Israel said in an analysis published shortly before Netanyahu’s tweet.

“When it comes to Jew hatred, Netanyahu is not usually reserved, often condemning anti-Semitic incidents that occur in the Muslim world or in Europe,” it wrote. Other Israeli officials had issued condemnations earlier. “The unhindered waving of Nazi flags and symbols in the US is not only offensive towards the Jewish community and other minorities,” Education Minister Naftali Bennet, a Netanyahu rival, said on Sunday.

“It also disrespects the millions of American soldiers who sacrificed their lives in order to protect the US and entire world from the Nazis,” he said in a statement. Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, said yesterday that Netanyahu had asked him “to convey Israel’s outrage over the attack and over the expressions of anti-Semitism and racism.”

Day-night Test is a step into the unknown: Stuart Broad,"Stuart Broad doesn’t know what to expect from the day-night Test against West Indies. Stuart Broad doesn’t know what to expect from the day-night Test against West Indies.

England seamer Stuart Broad has claimed that the first ever day-night Test match against the West Indies at Edgbaston might be a step into the unknown and he did know what to expect. This will be the first in England to be played with a pink ball.

Speaking at the sidelines of an event, Broad said,”This week, we are stepping into the unknown. I don’t know what to expect. I’ve tried to speak to a few people – obviously, the Australians are a bit different because they have played day-nighters with a different ball. The county lads said it’s not shined up very well at all, it’s gone really soft really quickly. It’s given bounce for the spinners but not really turned.”

Stating that the series against West Indies is a big series for England, he said, “This is the first Test of the series – it’s quite nerve racking,” Broad said. “You’re playing something that is completely unknown to you. I think it really opens up the series to start with.

Broad also revealed that the West Indies’ warm-up match at Derby put them in an advantageous position. “It looked like they had a great week with the pink ball. They have probably had more experience than us – they played in Dubai against it recently – so you could almost say they have an advantage having played a pink-ball game this week, going into the first Test. Whereas we are having one training session under lights and that is the only time we’re getting.”

Putting in a word about the batsman, Broad concluded by saying, “It is going to be really interesting and I think every batsman will be praying they don’t come in at that twilight period to face their first ball because you want it to be as normal as possible when you first get to the crease,” Broad noted. “As a team, we’ll have to try and make sure we have batsmen ‘in’ during that period because you could lose three or four wickets and it could cost you the Test match. Whoever is in – whoever is 30 not out, or 70 not out – will be getting a telling off if they get out.”

Earlier, India thrashed Sri Lanka in the third Test after putting up 487 runs in the first innings, with Shikhar Dhawan smashing a solid hundred. India’s promising young all-rounder Hardik Pandya continued to impress with the bat after hammering his first Test century of the career.

In reply, Sri Lanka failed miserably in the first innings after being bundled out for 135, with captain Dinesh Chandimal being the highest scorer in the side with 48 runs. Kuldeep Yadav showed a brilliant performance after picking up four wickets in his 13 overs.

After being given a follow-on for the second time in the series, the hosts failed to put up a lead in their second innings and were bowled out for 181, losing by an innings and 171 runs. Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers for the visitors in the second innings with four wickets in the bag.

After completing the task in just three days, the team gets extra two days to relax and prepare for the upcoming 5-match ODI series, which starts on August 20 in Dambulla.

"Paper Miracles: Sanjhi, the ancient art of hand cutting stencils from paper, gets a contemporary twist in an exhibition","Works from the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisted” Works from the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisted”

After many requests from curious onlookers, a fourth generation Sanjhi artist — Mohan Kumar Verma from Mathura — cuts a bird with flared wings taking flight. He does it with the help of handmade scissors and a tiny sheet of plucked paper with lightning fast speed. “This is all that I learnt from our grandfather. I’d lost my father and needed to support my family financially while other children of my age studied,” says the 48-year-old artist, who was showcasing the art of Sanjhi and depicting his works in the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisited” at Delhi’s Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre. The exhibition has been brought together by Delhi Crafts Council to celebrate their golden jubilee year. Over 80 artwork on display include depiction of domes flanked by minarets, decorated with designs of weeping willow, as clouds resembling Aladdin’s magical lamp hover from above. There is also a reinterpretion of Mughal garden illustrations from Good Earth’s coloring book Bagh-e-Bahar by another Sanjhi artist, Ashutosh Verma.

Sanjhi, the art of handcutting stencils from paper, is believed to have emerged over a 100 years ago as part of ritual decorations in the temples of Mathura and Vrindavan. The stencils depicting legends and pilgrimage locations associated with the life of Krishna are used to create intricate floor patterns or rangoli using coloured powder.

Purnima Rai, head of the organising committee and former President of Delhi Crafts Council, says, “With architecture as one of the many themes in the exhibition, the artists have portrayed buildings used in traditional Sanjhi, and reproduced several other architectural designs. Art is currently in a flux and its various possibilities need to reach out to more people. This show is a step in that direction.”

With the help of handmade paper, banana rice paper and jute paper, Mohan has replicated Mughal jali works inspired by the designs found in classic Mughal architecture, against the backdrop of a mirror. Artist Ram Soni has extensively cut out a series of illustrations of vases, spilling with flowers, out of silver foil, displayed against a deep blue colored backdrop. In Bamboo with Parrots, Soni has captured a parrot in a variety of postures while sitting atop a stylised bamboo tree — looking up at the sky and into the oblivion, searching for food and engaging with its counterpart.

As the craft enveloped into a declining phase in the early 20th century, where only a few temples in Vrindavan practiced it, the efforts of designers and NGOs including Delhi Crafts Council in recent decades have ensured a resurgence of the craft. Mohan says, “Almost 25 years ago, when I was invited at the National Crafts Museum in Delhi to display my products, no one was really willing to buy them. Even if a sheet of artwork paper was priced for Rs 100, people would question us and ask why it deserved to be sold at such a high price. It was demotivating and I had almost thought of quitting the profession. But as Delhi Crafts Council pushed us to bring in modern interpretations on coasters, lamps and wedding invitation cards, our craft flourished.” Mohan points out that he had even designed an entire wedding tent using Sanjhi art in Delhi and a pandal for Durga Puja in Kolkata a few years ago, where the exteriors of the pandal and the jewellery and clothing of the goddess was made of paper cut stencils. With most of the pieces at the exhibition now bearing a circled red mark and few works priced over a lakh, they only serve as a positive sign of a brighter future for the ancient artform.

The exhibition is on at Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, till August 12

Donald Trump disbands business councils after CEOs quit in protest,"US President Donald Trump disbanded his two business advisory councils after facing a string of resignations from the chief executives over his “ambiguous” response to violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. (Source: AP, File) US President Donald Trump disbanded his two business advisory councils after facing a string of resignations from the chief executives over his “ambiguous” response to violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. (Source: AP, File)

US President Donald Trump disbanded his two business advisory councils after facing a string of resignations from the chief executives over his “ambiguous” response to violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. Trump had established the Manufacturing Advisory Council in January after his swearing-in while the 16-member Strategic and Policy Forum was established in December when he was the president-elect.

“Rather than putting pressure on the business people of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!” Trump said in a tweet.

As many as 11 CEOs in the advisory councils have quit so far. A majority of them resigned after criticism mounted over the US president’s less-than-encouraging response to the weekend violence in Charlottesville, where a car rammed into a crowd peacefully protesting against the rally by white supremacists, killing a 32-year-old woman.

News reports appeared that more CEOs were likely to leave his presidential councils, in an apparent protest against Trump’s remarks that people on both sides were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville.

Eight CEOs — including Merck’s Kenneth Frazier, Intel’s Brian Krzanich, Kevin Plank of Under Armour, and Richard Trumka, president of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO) — had quit from Trump’s two advisory councils till yesterday.

Earlier in the day, members of the Strategic Policy Forum in a joint statement said that intolerance, racism and violence have absolutely no place in the country and are an affront to core American values.

Led by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, members of the Strategic Policy Forum included JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.

The President’s Strategic and Policy Forum was conceived as a bi-partisan group of business leaders called to serve our country by providing independent feedback and perspectives directly to the President on accelerating economic growth and job creation in the United States, the members said.

“We believe the debate over Forum participation has become a distraction from our well-intentioned and sincere desire to aid vital policy discussions on how to improve the lives of everyday Americans,” they said.

In a joint statement, the CEOs noted that job creation and supporting an inclusive pro-growth agenda remained important to the country’s progress.

“As such, the President and we are disbanding the Forum. Job creation and supporting an inclusive pro-growth agenda remain vitally important to the progress of our country. As Americans, we are all united in our desire to see our country succeed,” they said.

The Los Angeles Times said in a report: “The dissolution of the councils marks corporate America’s strongest repudiation yet of Trump, who ascended to the White House touting himself as the first CEO president.”

The Washington Post termed the development as a “major setback” to Trump’s relationship with the American business community.

JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, a member of the Strategy & Policy Forum, according to the daily, told employees in a note that his group decided to disband following Trump’s news conference, in which he appeared to show sympathy for some of the people who marched alongside the neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.

“Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader’s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,” Dimon wrote to his employees.

“Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville,” Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement before he announced his resignation.

“I believe the president should have been — and still needs to be — unambiguous on that point,” he added.

General Electric Chairman Jeff Immelt said, “The Committee I joined had the intention to foster policies that promote American manufacturing and growth. However, given the ongoing tone of the discussion, I no longer feel that this Council can accomplish these goals.”

“The President’s most recent statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred is unacceptable and has changed our decision to participate in the White House Manufacturing Advisory Council,” said Johnson & Johnson chief executive Alex Gorsky, who had previously said he would remain on the manufacturing council to have a voice at the table.

"Charlottesville crash suspect’s ex-teacher says he idolised Hitler, Nazism","James Alex Fields Jr. (L) before being arrested by police. REUTERS/Eze Amos James Alex Fields Jr. (L) before being arrested by police. REUTERS/Eze Amos

The young man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally was fascinated with Nazism, idolised Adolf Hitler, and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race, a former high school teacher said today. James Alex Fields Jr. also confided that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, Derek Weimer said in an interview with The Associated Press.

In high school, Fields was an “average” student, but with a keen interest in military history, Hitler, and Nazi Germany, said Weimer, who said he was Fields’ social studies teacher at Randall K Cooper high school in Union, Kentucky, in Fields’ junior and senior years. “Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy towards Nazism, that idolisation of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy,” Weimer said. “It would start to creep out.”

Police charged Fields with second-degree murder and other counts for allegedly driving his silver Dodge Challenger through a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, killing a 32-year-old woman and wounding at least 19 other people. A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large-scale police response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town and both troopers on board died. The 20-year-old Fields had been photographed hours earlier carrying the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that organized the “take America back” campaign in protest of the removal of a Confederate statue.

The group today denied any association with the suspect, even as a separate hate group that organised Saturday’s rally pledged on social media to organise future events that would be “bigger than Charlottesville.” The mayor of Charlottesville, political leaders of all political stripes, and activists and community organizers around the country planned rallies, vigils and education campaigns to combat the hate groups. They also urged President Donald Trump to forcefully denounce the organisations, some of which specifically cited Trump’s election after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric as validation of their beliefs.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities would pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash. Weimer recalled that school officials had singled out Fields when he was in 9th grade for his political beliefs and “deeply held, radical” convictions on race and Nazism.

“It was a known issue,” he said. Weimer said Fields left school for a while, and when he came back he was quieter about politics until his senior year, when politicians started to declare their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race. Weimer said Fields was a big Trump supporter because of what he believed to be Trump’s views on race. Trump’s proposal to build a border wall with Mexico was particularly appealing to Fields, Weimer said.

United States defender John Anthony Brooks has been ruled out for around three months with a thigh injury sustained on his competitive debut for Wolfsburg.

The Bundesliga side says tests on Tuesday and Wednesday revealed that Brooks tore a tendon in his right thigh in Saturday’s German Cup win over fourth-tier club Eintracht Norderstedt. Brooks went off in the 37th minute after a challenge.

Wolfsburg sporting director Olaf Rebbe says, “That’s a big blow for him and the club. We had closed this hole in our defence.”

Brooks joined Wolfsburg in the off-season for a reported fee of 20 million euros ($22.4 million) from Bundesliga rival Hertha Berlin in a record transfer for an American player.

"Barcelona close to Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele deals: Pep Segura","Coutinho has been linked with a move to Barcelona. (Source: AP File) Coutinho has been linked with a move to Barcelona. (Source: AP File)

Barcelona sporting manager Pep Segura has said the club are “close” to signing Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund.

Speaking after Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup gave their arch rivals a 5-1 aggregate victory, Segura said Barcelona were discussing terms with the attacking duo.

“We are close to Coutinho and Dembele, we are discussing their conditions but we do not know when they will be sealed,” Segura told Spanish television station TV3. “We hope they will be Barcelona players this season.”

Barcelona, who said on Monday they had agreed a deal to sign Brazilian midfielder Paulinho for 40 million euros ($47.19 million), are looking to fill the void left by Neymar after his world record 222 million euros transfer to Paris St Germain.

According to reports in British media, Coutinho has submitted a transfer request after Liverpool rejected a second bid worth 100 million euros from the La Liga club.

Barcelona’s other reported target, Dembele, has been suspended by Borussia Dortmund after the 20-year-old France international skipped training amid speculation of a possible move to Spain.

An initial Barca offer was rejected by Dortmund, with club bosses saying it was too low. German media have estimated the price of a move at more than 100 million euros.

Barcelona are clearly in need of reinforcements after being outclassed in the Super Cup. After losing 3-1 at home on Sunday, Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat came at the hands of a Madrid side minus Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Isco.

"More than 300 dead, 600 missing in Sierra Leone mudslides","Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is one of the leading contributors to the flooding and mudslides. (Photo: AP) Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is one of the leading contributors to the flooding and mudslides. (Photo: AP)

Fatmata Kamara had just stepped outside her house before dawn yesterday when she saw the muddy hillside collapsing above her. The only thing she could do was run. She was one of the survivors, those who managed to escape the surging mudslides and floodwaters in and around Sierra Leone’s capital that killed more than 300 people, many of them trapped as they slept. Another 600 people are missing, the Red Cross said today, and the death toll is expected to rise.

Thousands lost their homes in the disaster, which was triggered by heavy rains. “I ran away from the house, leaving behind my family,” a grieving Kamara told The Associated Press. “I am the only one that has survived, as my house and dozens of others were covered with mud and boulders.”

Rescuers dug with their bare hands through the thick, reddish mud to try to find any survivors in the debris of the homes. Heavy equipment was later brought in, said government spokesman Cornelius Deveaux. The military also was deployed to help. Some bodies were swept into the sea off the coast of the West African nation and have begun washing back ashore.

The mortuary of the Connaught Hospital in central Freetown was overwhelmed with the dead. More than 300 bodies of men, women and children were brought there, and many were laid out on the floor. Deveaux said an exact death toll was unknown, and many of the bodies were horribly mangled. President Ernest Bai Koroma said Sierra Leone was in a state of grief and mourning, with many survivors still in shock.

Radio journalist Gibril Sesay said he lost his entire family. “I am yet to grasp that I survived, and my family is gone,” he said through sobs, unable to continue.

Ahmed Sesay, caretaker of a two-story house near the Guma Valley Dam east of the capital, said he was sleeping around 6 a.m. when he felt a vibration. “It was like an earthquake. I ran out of my quarters to the gate of the compound,” he said. “The ground shook and I had to stay outside the compound until daybreak.”

An estimated 9,000 people have been affected in some way by the disaster, said Abdul Nasir, program coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “I have never seen anything like it,” he said. “A river of mud came out of nowhere and swallowed entire communities, just wiped them away. We are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss.”

Charles Mambu, a civil society activist and resident of one affected area, Mount Sugar Loaf, said the magnitude of the destruction indicated that hundreds more people could be dead. In one sign of hope, two people were pulled alive from the debris yesterday evening, Mambu said. The UN said it is providing emergency response assistance.

Contingency plans are being put in place to try to stem the outbreak of diseases such as cholera, Deveaux told radio station FM 98.1. The bodies that have been recovered will begin to be buried in the next 48 hours, said Sulaiman Parker, environmental protection officer for the Freetown City Council.

Many of the poor areas of Freetown are near sea level and have poor drainage systems, which makes flooding worse during the rainy season. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction of large residential houses in hilltop areas.

Thousands of makeshift settlements in and around the city were severely affected. “The government has been warning people not to construct houses in these areas. When they do this, there are risks,” Nasir said. “People don’t follow the standard construction rules, and that is another reason that many of these houses have been affected.”

Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is one of the leading contributors to the flooding and mudslides.

Turkish police have launched operations to track down 33 former staff of a national scientific research agency who are alleged to have been involved in last year’s failed coup attempt, the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Tuesday.

Anadolu said the suspects were alleged to have used ByLock, an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of orchestrating the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup attempt. Anadolu said police carried out operations in six provinces to find the 33 suspects from Turkey’s scientific research council TUBITAK.

Since the coup attempt some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 have been detained for alleged links to the putsch. The crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of Turkey’s Western allies, who fear the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.

Security sources also said 30 people suspected of being linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were arrested on Tuesday in operations in the southeastern province of Sirnak. The PKK, designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union, and United States, has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state, and the government has ramped up operations targeting the militants since the collapse of a ceasefire in 2015.

The incident happened early on in the match, as Warner attempted to pull a bouncer but missed it, leaving him no option but to retire hurt. He was rested on Wednesday, the final day of the intra-squad game at Darwin’s Marrara Oval.

The Vice-Captain passed a concussion test and the coach hoped that he would be okay. He was reported by cricket.com.au as saying, “He seems alright, walking around the ground today, so fingers crossed he’ll be okay and we’ll get an update in the next day or two. It’s always a scare when that happens, isn’t it? Hopefully he’s going to be OK.”

Pat Cummins confirmed that Warner looked in good shape and might play. “It’s good that Davey’s fine. He’s a little bit stiff and sore, but just speaking to him then, he’s all fine. It’s only a practice match so he might or might not be out there tomorrow but he seems to be in pretty good shape.”

Pack right before travelling during monsoon season,"Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo) Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo)

Before going on a trip during the rainy season, it is important to carry the right tools and instruments to save your belongings like cellphone and wallet from drenching. Carry zip lock bags, umbrellas, mosquito repellents and waterproof backpacks, suggest experts.

Narayana Menon K, co-founder at Wandertrails, an online platform enabling discovery and booking of experiences, has listed a few necessary items:

* Arm yourself with an umbrella or raincoat. A waterproof backpack is a must-have.

* Always carry a zip lock bag. It is good to keep the wallet and other expensive belongings safe as well like the smartphone and maybe other equipments like camera and lenses.

* It is the season when mosquito-borne diseases are rampant with stagnant puddles and blocked drains everywhere. Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for night time.

* It is best to carry own water, otherwise, drink only boiled water. The same goes for food, don’t eat from just anywhere. Street food is extremely difficult to say not to, at least make sure it is covered.

* Carry light synthetic clothes that will dry easily.

* Floaters and sandals are the best options in terms of footwear.

Inputs from Aloke Bajpai, CEO at ixigo, travel search engine:

* Having street food during the rainy season can be very unhygienic. Carry sachets of herbal teas and packaged food. Also, don’t drink water from unsealed bottles or the regular running tap.

* Always carry a first-aid box in case of an emergency. The probability of catching cold and falling sick during the rainy season is more than during any other time of the year.

* If planning to visit a new destination, always know how you can get help if stranded – the intensity of rain that the region receives, and emergency contact information of the local authorities. It is advisable to make reservations beforehand to ensure a safe journey.

* Chances of a power outage during a rainy day are more as compared to normal days. To keep phone active, it’s important to carry a power bank all the time.

* As it might get dark early, keep a flashlight. Don’t rely on the phone’s flashlight.

* It’s good to carry some extra plastic bags to keep electronics safe. They can also be used to keep wet clothes and food items.

Banks cut interest rates on savings bank accounts: All you need to know,"State Bank of India, the largest lender in the country, was the first to cut interest rates on savings bank accounts on July 31. Six more banks followed suit. The bank gave dropping inflation and high real interest rates as the prime considerations for the decision. (File photo) State Bank of India, the largest lender in the country, was the first to cut interest rates on savings bank accounts on July 31. Six more banks followed suit. The bank gave dropping inflation and high real interest rates as the prime considerations for the decision. (File photo)

A number of public and private banks in the country have cut interest rates on savings bank accounts. The move started with the country’s largest lender State Bank of India slashing interest rates on savings bank accounts from 4% to 3.5% per annum. True to expectation, others followed and till now seven banks have slashed rates.

After cutting the rates, SBI had explained in a statement: “The decline in the rate of inflation and high real interest rates are the primary considerations warranting a revision in the rate of interest on savings bank deposits,” adding that the bank had reduced the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by 90 basis points from the turn of 2017 on account of huge inflow of money in savings and current accounts due to demonetisation. Real interest rate plays a key part here as it is the interest that you actually receive after adjusting retail inflation. Due to the drop in inflation, the real interest increased substantially in the past after inflation dropped to a record low of 1.54% in June. This seemed to lay the ground for the rate cut.

How have the rate cuts progressed?

State Bank of India (SBI): SBI announced rate cut on July 31 on savings bank accounts by 50 basis points effectively reducing the rate from 4% to 3.5% per annum on deposits up to Rs 1 crore. The rate offered on deposits above Rs 1 crore remains at 4%. .

Bank of Baroda: The second bank to cut rates was Bank of Baroda. It shifted to a two-tier savings bank interest rate as well. The rate offered on deposits up to Rs 50 lakh was cut from 4% to 3.5%. The rate above Rs 50 lakh was not changed.

Axis Bank: The first private bank to follow SBI’s move was Axis Bank. The numbers of rate cut, rate offered and applicable deposit limits were the same as Bank of Baroda.

Indian Bank: The PSU lender said in a regulatory filing at the BSE that it “has introduced two tier interest rate structure for saving bank accounts and will offer 4 per cent interest per annum for incremental balance over Rs. 50 lakh and 3.50 per cent per annum for balance up to Rs. 50 lakh”. The change was brought into force from August 16.

Karnataka Bank: The changes were linked to daily balances. If the daily balance were to be below Rs 1 lakh, the rate offered by the bank is now only 3%, a change from the earlier 4%. If the daily balance remains over Rs 1 lakh to a maximum Rs 50 lakh, the bank reduced rates from 4% to 3.5%. The bank offers 4% interest on daily balance between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore. And a positive change seen was the revised rate of 5% per annum from the earlier 4% on daily balances over Rs 1 crore.

Yes Bank: The private sector bank reduced the interest on savings accounts with balance of Rs 1 lakh or less from 6% to 5%. However, the 6% rate will remain for the over Rs 1 lakh to below Rs 1 crore deposit bracket. For deposits of or above Rs 1 crore, the bank has reduced the interest rate from 6.5% to 6.25%.

HDFC Bank: One of the biggest lenders in the country, HDFC slashed rates for savings bank account balance below Rs 50 lakh to 3.5% per year. The 4% rate will continue for deposits of and above Rs 50 lakh. The change will come into force from August 19, 2017. Also, it will be applicable on resident as well as non-resident account holders.

The Reserve Bank of India had deregulated interest rates on savings bank accounts in October 2011. Now, banks are at a liberty to set rates of their choosing as they seem proper. Banks with higher market share and older presence had maintained interest rates of around 4%. The relatively newer banks or those that were attempting to make inroads to gain market share had offered higher rates of 6-7% like Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank.

The daily calculation of interest offered on savings was also started in 2010. Earlier, the banks gave interests on least amount of balance in a savings account between the 10th and the last day of each month. It was eventually replaced as it was deemed unfair to customers.

Delhi: AAP govt to get rid of 141 spots prone to fatal road accidents,"Road accidents cause more deaths. (Source: File Photo/representational) Road accidents cause more deaths. (Source: File Photo/representational)

The Delhi government on Thursday decided to remove over 140 “black spots”, prone to fatal accidents, from the city’s roads in the next four months to ensure safety of commuters. The decision was taken in a meeting of the State Road Safety Council, reconstituted by the AAP government last month.

Talking to reporters after the meet, Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said there are 141 black spots identified on the basis of three fatal accidents occurring within 500-metre radius of a particular road stretch every year. “The council today held its first meeting where we decided to remove all 141 black spots in the next three-four months. All district magistrates have been asked to identify more such black spots under their jurisdiction and share the information with the PWD, the traffic police and other concerned agencies,” Gahlot said. He said corrective measures will be taken at the earliest to prevent accidents on the city’s roads.

As per the government’s figures, there are certain heavily accident-prone areas in the city with high number of black spots such as Shastri Park which has 10, the highest, such spots in the city. Also, national highway 8 (Rajokri) has the second highest number of black spots at at nine, followed by eight each in ISBT Kashmiri Gate, Peera Garhi area, and seven in Majnu-ka-Tilla among other areas witnessing a high number of fatal accidents.

Pathankot strike: Punjab sacks errant cop SP Salwinder Singh,"Salwinder Singh Salwinder Singh

PUNJAB CHIEF Minister Amarinder Singh has issued an order for the “premature retirement” of Punjab Police SP Salwinder Singh, citing his “controversial conduct”, “indiscipline” and for “bringing (a) bad name to Punjab police.”

Salwinder, 54, made national news last year when he claimed that terrorists from the Jaish-e-Mohammed had captured his SUV to carry out the attack on the Pathankot airbase on January 2, 2016. Consequently, the officer was questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and put through a lie-detection test also before being given a clean chit.

Last Saturday, the Chief Minister signed on the order, which read: “Retire him prematurely”.

Sources said the order did not make it clear if the state’s Home department would give the officer a notice of three months or salary of three months in case he was to be relieved with immediate effect, which is mandatory as per the rules.

Read | Jailed SP Salwinder Singh wants salary during suspension period hiked from 50% to 75%

Salwinder was declared a proclaimed offender in a sexual abuse case before he surrendered in April. He has been named an accused in two criminal cases of sexual abuse and sexual harassment, respectively. Placed under suspension, Salwinder is lodged in Amritsar Central Jail.

Punjab DGP Suresh Arora had recommended premature retirement for Salwinder, citing a list of incidents of misconduct, indiscipline, and criminal cases against him.

Last January, Salwinder had claimed that his SUV was waylaid by the terrorists on the new year’s eve of 2016, when he was travelling in the vehicle along with his cook and a friend. He claimed that he and his cook were thrown out of the car by the terrorists who reached near the airbase with his friend as a hostage.

According to police, the terrorists slit the friend Rajesh Verma’s throat and headed for the airbase to carry out the attack on the intervening night of January 1. Verma survived the attack.

Salwinder was named an accused in a sexual harassment case in October 2016 after some policewomen filed a complaint against him. A departmental inquiry was ordered before a case was registered.

He was booked in another case related to sexual harassment in August last year. The complainant had accused him of accepting Rs 50,000 for deleting his name from a rape case. Another complaint of sexual harassment was made against him when he served as an ASI in Punjab Police Academy at Phillaur.

Salwinder had recently sought enhancement in salary during his suspension period from 50 to 70 per cent.

Venezuela officials raid home of fired dissident attorney general Luisa Ortega,"Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/Files Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/Files

Venezuelan intelligence officers raided the home of the former attorney general, who was fired this month after she broke ranks with President Nicolas Maduro, while her replacement urged the arrest of her lawmaker husband.

Four motorbikes and seven patrol cars belonging to the SEBIN intelligence service were seen outside the Caracas home of the ex-attorney general, Luisa Ortega, AFP journalists observed. “At this moment SEBIN is searching my home as revenge by this government for my fight against totalitarianism,” Ortega wrote on Twitter yesterday.

She did not say where she and her husband were. Ortega was sacked two weeks ago as the first act of a new supreme assembly loyal to Maduro that has set about quashing dissent and hemming in the opposition, which controls the rival legislature.

Earlier yesterday, her successor, Tarek William Saab, said he had asked officials to go after Ortega’s husband, German Ferrer, a former loyalist lawmaker who has split from the ruling Socialist Party. The charges have “nothing to do with” the political leanings of Ferrer or Ortega, Saab said.

He accused Ferrer of being part of a network trying to extort money from businessmen linked to Venezuela’s all-important oil sector, promising them protection from prosecution on corruption allegations in exchange for money.

A decision on whether to grant an arrest warrant against Ferrer — who has parliamentary immunity — rests with Venezuela’s supreme court, which up to now has systematically sided with Maduro. Ortega in recent weeks accused Maduro of “dictatorial ambitions.”

She rebelled against his administration in April when the supreme court tried — before reversing course — to assume the powers of the legislative National Assembly. Her criticism sharpened when Maduro then set about creating the rival Constituent Assembly, which is packed with his supporters.

Most major countries in the Americas, including the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile have dismissed the Constituent Assembly as illegitimate and a tool to undermine Venezuelan democracy.

Usain Bolt reveals injury details after being questioned for falling in farewell race,"Usain Bolt of Jamaica reacts after the final. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt of Jamaica reacts after the final. (Source: Reuters)

Usain Bolt on Thursday revealed injury details on Twitter after he was questioned for falling in his farewell race at the World Athletics Championships. He later deleted the tweets saying that he has never cheated his fans in any way.

Saying that his injury would need three months of rehabilitation, Bolt said, “Sadly I have tear of the proximal myotendineous junction of biceps femoris in my left hamstring with partial retraction. 3 months rehab.”

“I don’t usually release my medical report to the public but sadly I have sat and listened to people questioning if I was really injured. I have never been one to cheat my fans in any way & my entire desire at the championship was run one last time for my fans. Thanks for the continued support my fans and I rest, heal and move onto the next chapter of my life #Love&LoveAlone.”

The tweets were removed minutes after they were posted by the Jamaican.

In his final relay, Bolt pulled up sharply, falling to the ground and losing the race. He previously ended his 100meters career with a bronze while Justin Gatlin won gold. The hamstring injury will also leave him out of the Manchester Untied charity match against Barcelona next month.

"In rare move, US military leaders condemn racism, extremism","The United States’ top general and five of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have bluntly spoken out against white supremacy and bigotry, seen as as a rare veiled criticism of President Donald Trump by the military after his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia. “One by one, the US military’s most senior leaders have publicly — and bluntly — repudiated the racist violence that plunged Charlottesville into chaos Saturday, declaring the nation’s armed forces as being unequivocally against hatred,” The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Trump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday’s clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed “both sides” for the violence. The rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.

“You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” Trump said. “I thought what happened was a horrible moment for our country, but there are two sides to every story,” he said, triggering a national storm. The backlash over his failure unequivocally to condemn racism and white supremacy, culminated in the dissolution of two key business advisory panels and an avalanche of condemnation from across the political spectrum.

Usually the US top military personnel stay out of domestic politics, American media noted. Joining other military leaders in their condemnation of the violence in Charlottesville, General Joe Dunford, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff said there was no place for “racism and bigotry” in the American military. “I can absolutely and unambiguously tell you that there’s no place for racism and bigotry in the US military or in the United States as a whole,” he told reporters during a visit to Beijing.

Dunford is in China as part of the Trump administration’s effort to drum up support for punitive actions on North Korea for its nuclear provocations. He said that military leaders “were speaking directly to the force and to the American people… to make it clear that that kind of racism and bigotry is not going to stand inside the force… and to remind (the American people) of the values for which we stand in the US military which are reflective of what I believe to be the values of the United States.”

Earlier, the Commandant of the US Marine Corps Gen. Robert B. Neller said, “No place for racial hatred or extremism in @USMC. Our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment frame the way Marines live and act.” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson was the first to issue a tweet on the subject on Saturday, as the protests were ongoing in Charlottesville. “Events in Charlottesville unacceptable and musn’t be tolerated @USNavy for ever stands against intolerance & hatred,” he said. He was joined yesterday by Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Mark A. Milley, Air Force Gen. Dave Goldfein and Chief of the National Guard Bureau Joseph Lengyel.

“The Army doesn’t tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It’s against our Values and everything we’ve stood for since 1775,” Milley tweeted. Milley was adamant that nothing he is saying in his tweet is aimed at being political. “That is the furthest thing from my mind. I am not involved in domestic politics. I want good order and discipline in my ranks.”

None of the statements directly mentioned Trump or his statements on the neo-Nazi marches over the weekend. The military’s five service chiefs had issued firm, forceful statements that stand apart from remarks made by President Trump, who faces deepening criticism for his repeated attempts to evenly distribute blame for clashes between white nationalists and the anti-fascist protesters who showed up to oppose them, the Post commented.

A woman died and 19 were injured when a car, which police said was driven by 20-year-old James Alex Fields of Ohio, a suspected Nazi sympathiser, slammed into people demonstrating along a crowded, narrow street near the University of Virginia. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that he was “very saddened” by what unfolded in Charlottesville.

Working It Out: Management lessons from the Ramayana,"When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically. When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically.

History teaches if we are willing to learn.

As an Indian, like most of my friends, I grew up listening to stories from epics like Ramayana and the Mahabharata. I personally believe that there are lot of things today’s 21st century managers and corporate leaders can learn from these wise pieces of literature. I suggest reading this article without any religious biases as the intent is just to learn from the historic or the mythological characters. Read this as a student of ‘history’ and you will gain the most out of it. If you have not read the Ramayana, I advise you to read a few pages about it on the Internet, this will help you get the most out of this article.

1. Never have too many controlling stakeholders in your business:

King Dashratha had three wives – Kaushalaya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. Thus, when you have too many stakeholders in decision making, it becomes difficult to control your business. Kaushalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharat and Sumitra gave birth to Laxmana and Shatrughana. Power dilutes when too many stakeholders take charge of any business.

2. Never sign a document without reading the terms and conditions:

Once queen Kaikeyi had saved King Dashratha’s life in battle. Dashratha was very pleased with his queen and thus in order to repay the favour, the king told her that she can ask for any two boons from the king. When Kaikeyi’s mind was influenced by her maid Manthara, she used these boons against her stepson Rama and tried to make her own son Bharata the next crowned king of the kingdom. She asked the king to send Rama on a 14-year-long exile to the forest and to declare her son Bharata as the next king of the kingdom. In business, you cannot trust anyone. Make sure, you have all the your contacts in black and white.

3. Learn from the experts:

King Dashratha sent his son Rama to sage Vishwamitra for learning the art of warfare. As the promoter or owner of the business, learn to send your children to the most suitable teacher. Raise your next generation of leaders by putting them in challenging situations. Help them develop the skills they must learn to face a challenging business environment.

4. Be willing to compete:

When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. The king organised a competition in which Rama defeated all other warriors and emerged as the most suitable candidate. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically.

5. Do not covet what does not belong to you:

If you see the entire story plot of Ramayana you will realise that it is made up of storylines where human greed took charge. Kaikeyi wanted her son to be the next king; Ravana’s sister Surpanakha wanted to marry Laxmana, who rejected her evil advances and ended up cutting her nose; King Bali abducted the wife of his own brother Sugreeva. Likewise, Ravana wanted to possess Sita, who was the rightfully wedded wife of Rama. Ravana – blinded by his desire to possess Sita – ended up abducting her. The entire battle of Lanka was fought to free Sita from the shackles of the evil king Ravana. In your business too, learn to play ethical. Do not do anything illegal or overlook laws to secure a quick win.

6. Keep wise counsel:

Queen Kaikeyi kept an evil maid Manthara as her counsel. Over time, the woman managed to poison Kaikeyi’s mind against Rama. King Ravana avoided the counsel of his wife Mandodari who told her to return Sita respectfully to her husband. He did not listen to his own brother Vibhishana and kicked him out of his kingdom. Do not have subordinates who always try to flatter you. Surround yourself with a team of people who tell you what you need to know and not what you like to know.

7. Choose your joint venture alliances carefully:

Rama, in order to win, needed a powerful ally. Yet when it came to making an alliance, he choose Sugreeva over his powerful brother King Bali. Bali was a very powerful man who had already defeated Ravana once, and yet Rama did not join forces with him because he was an immoral man. He kicked his own brother Sugreeva out of the Kishkindha kingdom and abducted his wife. If you partner with wrong and unethical people you may win in the short run, but in the lose run will lose your reputation.

8. Negotiate and do not fight disruption:

Before declaring a full-scale war, Rama tried to negotiate with King Ravana by sending Angada as his emissary. Later on, even Hanumaan offered peace to Ravana, but he was so blinded in his ignorance that he failed to see a more powerful force. Innovate on your strategy regularly. Choose innovation over ignorance. A low of businesses die because their leader could not negotiate and adapt well to a powerful force of disruption. The businesses which do not change with time, eventually get destroyed.

Be a curious student and see what you should learn from Ramayana to take your professional life to the next level.

Days after insolvency plea: Jaypee investors can submit claim by August 24,"Last week, panic broke out among those who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects after the insolvency plea. (Express Photo) Last week, panic broke out among those who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects after the insolvency plea. (Express Photo)

In an effort to reach out to home buyers who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects in Noida and Greater Noida, formats for submission of their claims have been made public on the company’s website. Three formats — for operational creditors, financial creditors, workmen and employees — are on the website and the deadline for submitting them is August 24.

Last week, panic broke out among home investors after IDBI filed an insolvency plea in the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), stating that the company had defaulted on a loan of Rs 526 crore. The NCLT appointed an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) to look into the issue.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Wednesday also expressed sympathy with the agitating home buyers and maintained that all those who had invested in the projects should get their flats.

Replying to a query on the issue, Jaitley said, “Those who are aggrieved can get remedy under this law (the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). If there is any such move, the government’s full sympathy is with those who have paid money and have rights on the flats.” An official statement from Anuj Jain, the IRP, said: “The claim is required to be filed in the requisite format as prescribed by IBC, and the regulations framed thereunder. The requisite format of all the above forms will be placed on the website of the company on Monday, August 14, 2017, and can be downloaded from there. The last date for submitting the claims is August 24, 2017.”

Explaining the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), Jain maintained that in the following days, “necessary information to prepare an information memorandum of the company” will be collected. “I will prepare a list of creditors of the company and their claims. For this purpose, a public announcement has already been made in two newspapers on August 12, 2017 inviting claims from creditors, including the flat owners of the company,” Jain’s statement read.

He added that the entire process of coming up with a resolution plan is likely to be submitted before the NCLT within 180 days. Maintaining that the CIRP was not a liquidation proceeding, but rather “a resolution for the current situation”, the statement read: “I am conscious of the interest of key stakeholders including flat owners.”

‘El Chapo’ seeking new lawyers in US drug trafficking case,"In this February 22, 2014 file photo, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City.

(Source: AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File)

Mexican drug lord and escape artist Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman wants to hire new lawyers in his US drug trafficking case, but there’s questions about how they’ll get paid. Guzman is set to appear Monday in federal court in Brooklyn where a judge is expected to address questions about whether he can replace his public defense lawyers with private ones.

His current legal team has asked for assurances from prosecutors that if he hires the private lawyers, the government won’t later seek forfeiture of any legal fees based on arguments the money came from his estimated $14 billion in drug profits.

Prosecutors have argued that taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay for his defense. But they also said in a letter to the court last week that the government will not “grant a blanket prospective assurance” that it won’t go after money spent on a private defense.

One of the private lawyers seeking to represent Guzman successfully defended John “Junior” Gotti, son of the notorious organized crime family boss, at a 2005 trial. The younger Gotti walked free after an acquittal on a securities fraud count and a mistrial on more serious racketeering counts.

In phone interviews with The Associated Press last week, the lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he’s more concerned about getting the court to sign off on the change of lawyers than about legal fees.

“I’m going into the case regardless,” Lichtman said. As for his impressions of Guzman, “He is charming, funny, highly intelligent. I enjoyed getting to know him. … I don’t judge someone by what I read in the papers.”

Mexico extradicted Guzman in January to the US, where he pleaded not guilty to charges that his drug trafficking operation, the Sinaloa cartel, laundered billions of dollars and oversaw a ruthless campaign of murders and kidnappings.

The defense has claimed that he’s being held in inhumane and overly restrictive conditions at a high-security jail in Manhattan known for housing alleged mobsters and terrorists.

The government has argued that his strict jail conditions are appropriate for someone who escaped from prison twice in Mexico, including once through a mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) tunnel dug to the shower in his cell. Prosecutors said that even while he was behind bars in Mexico, Guzman used coded messages, bribes and other means to control his Sinaloa cartel and orchestrate his breakouts.

From butterfly style to mermaid style, we are now spoiled for choice and a lot of it has got to do with Bollywood celebs paving the way for us.

Recently, Kalki Koechlin was seen attending a press meet in Delhi to talk about her upcoming film Jia Aur Jia and she picked up a striped sari from Maku Textiles. We love how she wore it with a striped black and white boat neck blouse.

It’s not easy to carry stripes the way she did and it is kind of inspiring. The Margarita, with a Straw actor rounded out her look with blue tinted Lennon glasses, a pair of gold jhumkas, muted make-up with a soft pink lip shade and a neat bun. We think she looked lovely.

Meanwhile, Pooja Hegde was seen mixing prints and patterns well in a Nupur Kanoi sari. Although it’s not something we would have picked up, we think the Mohenjo Daro wore it well.

The way the sari was draped by celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavri reminded us of how women in Bengal wear it in this particular style with the pallu falling beautifully at the front. She accessorised it with earrings from heritage fine jewellery by Sunita Shekhawat and added a nice, modern vibe to her look with a wavy ponytail.

However, Samantha Ruth Prabhu left us in a state of shock. It needs a lot of courage to try something so experimental as there is always the fear of things backfiring and in this case, it did.

The way she styled her black and white sari is really innovative but it’s not something we would ever try. Having said that, we love her accessory game. We think those statement earrings are a must-have.

Another actor who left us disappointed is Taapsee Pannu. Having given us a series of stellar looks, the Naam Shabana actor failed to impress us in the garish sari, jacket and belt by Aharin.

There’s absolutely nothing about this look that we like. Celebrity stylist Devki B could have done better, much better.

Whose draping style do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

"Battered by waves, British coastguard completes daring sea rescue","Grab of Footage shot from a helicopter. (Source: Maritime Coastguard Agency) Grab of Footage shot from a helicopter. (Source: Maritime Coastguard Agency)

A British rescue worker was battered by waves but still completed a daring sea rescue after three people got into difficulty on the west coast of England, a video released by British coastguard service on Tuesday showed. Footage shot from a helicopter showed a man clinging to a rock in the sea near Bude, 200 miles (321.87 km) southwest of London, after he became cut off by a rising tide on Saturday evening.

Mark Hughes, a winchman for the coastguard who is known as “Spike”, was lowered from the helicopter to save him when he was caught blindsided by a wave. Hughes reached the man and was attaching him to the wire when both were washed into the sea by a second wave. They were winched quickly out of the surf, while two other people were also rescued from a nearby beach.

“This video clearly shows what can happen when people are cut off by the tide but also the sterling job Spike the winchman did in the harsh conditions and rapidly changing situation to successfully rescue the casualties,” said Captain Graham Finn. Two of those rescued were taken to a nearby hospital and were treated for mild hypothermia.

Lessons from Gorakhpur,"At least 71 children lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7.(Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) At least 71 children lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7.(Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

The Gorakhpur tragedy has two very pertinent facets and it is important to separate them. The first, obviously, is the acute face of the tragedy: the shortage of oxygen supply in the critical care unit of a tertiary care public hospital. The second is the failure of India’s public health system, which has allowed “encephalitis” to become an annual outbreak in the region.

Let us begin with the latter.

‘Encephalitis’ is a misnomer. The correct expression is Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) — an umbrella term for diseases with certain characteristic symptoms. So when you hear “encephalitis” in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar mentioned in the same breath, be cautious. They are very different diseases, apart from their presentations.

From a policy perspective, this generalisation could have had disastrous public health consequences. For long, annual “encephalitis” outbreaks in the adjoining districts of Gorakhpur and Kushinagar were thought to be rooted in Japanese Encephalitis (JE). JE is caused by a virus that is found in pigs, water birds and livestock, and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. UP has introduced JE vaccination in its routine immunisation schedule, and has organised, for several years now, special vaccination drives before summer. In 2013, when this writer was reporting the outbreak for The Indian Express, the administration in Gorakhpur boasted of over 90% vaccine coverage. But somewhere around mid-August, these were the numbers: a total 226 admissions and 59 deaths in Gorakhpur, and 248 cases and 43 deaths in Kushinagar. Of these, five patients in Gorakhpur and eight in Kushinagar had tested positive for JE.

In 2012, however, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) identified 100 isolates of organisms called enteroviruses (EV) — specifically the human EV 89 and EV 76 types — from 1,000 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children admitted to Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital. As scientists told this writer then, 10% positivity is considered a great testing success in CSF samples. These enteroviruses spread through contaminated water, and trigger symptoms very similar to JE. And they are, of course, included under the ambit of the generalised, convenient term, ‘AES’. Thus, in Gorakhpur, most children did not get sick after being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus; they merely had very bad quality water.

In Bihar the same year, scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other experts argued for classifying “encephalitis” outbreaks as Acute Neurological Syndrome (ANS) after carrying out their first investigation in Muzaffarpur district. They published the results of their investigation in The Lancet this year, identifying a toxicological root in the litchis grown in the district.

***

Clearly, epidemiological investigation, a key discipline in public health, and central to understanding the root of “mystery” diseases, has been chaotic in both UP and Bihar for almost a decade. The system has been reactive — busy treating symptoms rather than getting decisive, coordinated answers for, and targeting the roots of, disease.

In 1981, epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose described a phenomenon called the ‘Prevention Paradox’ — the public health dogma that preventive interventions that benefit entire populations have very little or no tangible impact on individual health. Thus, they are not appreciated enough, even though they save the public health system a lot of money.

Vaccination is perhaps a more individual approach to public health. Every child is vaccinated, and there is the psychological impact of benefitting from an intervention. Obviously, when the target is a vaccine-preventable disease like polio or even JE, vaccines work wonders, and their importance cannot be overemphasised in population health. However, in this case in UP and Bihar, should JE vaccination have been made the only poster public health intervention? In Gorakhpur, NIV scientists have been pointing to enteroviruses since 2005-06. But neither the UPA’s erstwhile Total Sanitation Campaign nor the present government’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan targeted this actively.

***

Now consider the acute events that led to the present crisis. It is a blot on India’s public health system that handheld “ambu-bags” are a characteristic feature of government hospital emergencies — not just in “interior” districts like Gorakhpur, but also in Delhi and Mumbai. This is a commentary on how lost we are in health financing, payment and delivery mechanisms, despite many continuing policy experiments.

So, after all the PPPs, performance-based incentives, RFPs and RFQ models, and the debates around universal healthcare, social insurance, single- and multi-payer payment systems, it is a travesty that not only was the one tertiary health facility in a 300-km radius dependent on a contract and a subcontract for the supply of oxygen in its ICU, dues of less than $ 10,000 were delayed so long — and that finally, despite being cleared by the state Health Department, payment to the supplier was held up in administrative bottlenecks.

But then again, this is no surprise. One of the images that stands out for this writer from her reporting in 2013 is that of the new 100-bed AES ward in BRD College, with 25 new ventilators purchased that year, but lying unused despite the growing number of patients, because the installation of oxygen pipelines had missed deadlines.

There is a slide that Harvard health economist Peter Berman always uses in his classes. It is from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland:

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

“I don’t much care where…,” said Alice.

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

“…so long as I get Somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.

Health systems scholars, funding agencies and policy thinktanks like the World Bank, IMF, and Oxfam have many disagreements. But the one thing that most agree on is the need for evidence-based action, as opposed to running in the dark, in search of Alice’s “somewhere”.

For every public health problem, this entails determining a goal, identifying an intervention that can help achieve that goal, ensuring a monitoring system to check for problems and course correction along the way and, finally at its conclusion, having a system for evaluating what the programme achieved, and where it failed. Introducing these seemingly logical steps for health policy decisions remains a challenge in India.

Experts like the Harvard economist William Hsiao have long argued for identifying “control knobs” to overhaul health systems at the roots, against knee-jerk approaches to policy conundrums. Many of these classic control knobs can be traced to the present escalation: “financing, payment, regulation, organisation”. These could be the routes towards targeted policy solutions to course-correct.

It must be pointed out here that UP, or even India, is no exception. Countries with higher income levels and with far bigger health budgets, too, are struggling to identify the right models for financing and delivering public health. Among OECD countries, the United States is a classic example of poor health outcomes despite gross overspending on health. It is now well established that while health budgets are critical, spending money alone is not enough. This is, of course, not to undermine the problems resulting from sectors like health and education historically getting the short end of the stick in India.

There is increasing realisation, however, that public health delivery is a complex story, entrenched in cultures of governance, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms on the one hand, and social structures, gender roles, income levels and inequalities on the other. The latter are classified under the “social determinants” of health. And as Gorakhpur has shown, it is always the poorest who face the brunt of poor health policies, management and financing.

US and China have to work through ‘difficult issues’: Top US military officer,"Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford reviews a Chinese honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Bayi Building in Beijing, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo) Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford reviews a Chinese honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Bayi Building in Beijing, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo)

The top U.S. military officer told his Chinese counterpart Tuesday that the U.S. and China have “many difficult issues” to work through, during a visit that comes amid tensions over North Korea’s missile program, Taiwan and China’s claims in the South China Sea. Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the remarks at the opening of a meeting with Fang Fenghui, chief of the People’s Liberation Army’s joint staff department.

U.S. officials say Dunford’s visit aims to create a mechanism for improving communication between the sides, especially on sensitive issues such as North Korea. Dunford and Fang signed an agreement committing the sides to that goal, with the details to be discussed during talks in Washington in November. Fang said Dunford’s visit was a key part of efforts to expand dialogue between the U.S. and China as agreed by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, when they met earlier this year.

To that end, China has arranged a series of important meetings and visits to help Dunford “know more about our military, (boost) our cooperation and build up our friendship,” Fang said.

Dunford responded that the U.S. considered the meetings important to making progress on areas of disagreement, without citing any specific examples.

“I think here, we have to be honest – we have many, many difficult issues where we don’t necessarily share the same perspective,” Dunford said. “I know we share one thing: We share a commitment to work through these difficult issues,” he added, saying that with the guidance of political leaders “we are going to make some progress over the next few days.” This is the highest-level meeting between the two countries’ militaries since Trump and Xi met in Florida in April.

The U.S. delegation will be flying to the northeastern city of Shenyang on Wednesday to observe an exercise staged by the People’s Liberation Army’s Northern Theater Command. Fang cited the event as being among the measures aimed at building mutual trust and understanding.

While the sides agreed several years ago to establish a hotline between the Pentagon and China’s defense ministry, that mechanism has never gone into operation. U.S. officials say they’ve attempted to use it, but that the Chinese side has never answered their requests.

The Chinese and U.S. militaries have joined in naval exercises off the coast of Hawaii and other limited multinational drills mainly aimed at dealing with humanitarian disasters. They’ve also tried to improve mutual trust through agreements on dealing with unexpected encounters at sea.

Despite those, China deeply resents the presence of the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.

Last week, China expressed its “strong dissatisfaction” with the U.S. over the Navy’s latest freedom of navigation operation in which a warship sailed past one of China’s man-made islands.

Dunford is visiting South Korea, Japan and China after a week in which Trump said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the U.S. In a phone call with Trump on Saturday, Chinese President Xi said all sides should avoid rhetoric or action that would worsen tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Taliban urge Donald Trump to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

The United States should withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan and stop listening to “stooges” in Kabul, the Taliban warned in an open letter to US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.

The Trump administration is working to finalise a regional strategy that could include nearly 4,000 additional US troops, part of a NATO-led coalition, that have been requested by commanders in the country. That plan has faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.

“Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,” the Taliban said in the English-language letter released to media and addressed to Trump.

The Taliban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, have been waging an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001. In the lengthy statement, the Taliban criticized the Afghan government as “stooges”, “lying corrupt leaders” and “repulsive sellouts” who are providing Washington with overly optimistic “rosy pictures” of the situation in Afghanistan.

“The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!” the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties. The statement also took aim at generals, who the Taliban said “are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled” soldiers.

“We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,” the letter said. “A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.”

The senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces. Powerful voices in the US government, including Republican Senator John McCain, have also called for an “enduring” US military presence in Afghanistan.

The Taliban letter concludes by saying the conflict could be resolved by the withdrawal of foreign troops. “Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,” the Taliban said. “The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.”

"Man gets 10-year jail for kidnapping, raping minor girl","The court also imposed a fine of Rs 11,000 on Paswan and said it shall be given as compensation to the child. (Representational image) The court also imposed a fine of Rs 11,000 on Paswan and said it shall be given as compensation to the child. (Representational image)

A man, who raped a 13-year-old girl twice in a factory after kidnapping her, has been sent to jail for 10 years by a Delhi court. The court awarded rigorous jail term to Chhedi Paswan, saying prosecution has proved the case beyond doubt.

The court took a lenient view and awarded the minimum sentence of 10 years jail to the man, who was in custody since his arrested in February 2013, prescribed for raping a woman when she is less than 16 years of age. Paswan used to live in a factory in east Delhi where he was working.

“It is proved on record that accused had kidnapped the victim, wrongfully confined her for a night in a factory room and committed rape/penetrative sexual assault twice upon her,” Additional Sessions Judge Ashwani Kumar Sarpal said. The court also said the testimony of the victim was reliable, convincing and trustworthy and the forensic report also confirmed that the girl was subjected to sexual assault by him.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 11,000 on Paswan and said it shall be given as compensation to the child. It also directed the Delhi Legal Service Authority to pay appropriate compensation to the victim who belongs to a poor family, for the mental torture and agony she has suffered.

A missing complaint for the girl was lodged by her mother on February 11, 2013, alleging that she had gone to market the previous day but had not returned home. During investigation, the police searched the factory premises situated in front of the victim’s house and the minor was found lying there wrapped in a blanket. The man was arrested from the spot.

The girl told the court that on the day of incident, her parents had gone to a hospital and accused took her to the factory premises on the pretext that there was a call for her on his mobile phone. When she went there to attend the phone call, the man misbehaved with her to which she objected and sought to leave. The man then gagged and raped her twice and left her in the factory room after wrapping her in the blanket, she said. Due to suffocation, she fell unconscious and was rescued the next morning by her family members and the police.

During the trial, the man claimed he was falsely implicated due to a quarrel between him and the girl’s mother a few days before the incident. The judge rejected his plea saying he took inconsistent and different defence at various stages and the changes in his stand pointed towards his guilt as well as tendency to mislead the court.

Angel Di Maria on Tuesday uploaded a picture from his official Instagram account which was a collage of various football legends that he has played with in different teams and at different points of time and joked about how lucky they were.

There is no doubt that Di Maria’s illustrious career has given him a chance to create memories with few of the best footballers that this era has produced which include his Argentina teammate Lionel Messi, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, former Manchester United players Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazilian striker Neymar, who has become the most expensive footballer with a record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain.

Di Maria on Tuesday uploaded a collage with the above mentioned forwards and joked, “How lucky were these kids, hahahahahaha. What a chance!”

The PSG winger has recently been in news regarding a move to Camp Nou after reports emerged that Messi has encouraged the move but the club fears that they have strained their relations with the French club too much to go ahead with the deal.

Relations between the two clubs strained during Neymar’s transfer deal when the Qatar based club took the Brazilian despite their unwillingness to let go of him.

Glenn Maxwell can become Australia’s long-term solution for number six spot: Michael Hussey,"Glenn Maxwell scored his first Test century in three years against India. (Source: AP) Glenn Maxwell scored his first Test century in three years against India. (Source: AP)

Former Australian middle order batsman Micheal Hussey has hoped that hard-hitting all rounder Glenn Maxwell can perform with the bat in the upcoming tour to Bangladesh and secure his spot in the middle order. Claiming that Glenn Maxwell has the potential to become the linchpin at the number six slot Hussey also said that he needs to score heavily to stake a claim.

“He definitely can (become Australia’s long-term No.6), there’s no doubt he has the talent. It looks like he and Cartwright are fighting it out for the No.6 spot in Bangladesh. He’s got a great opportunity to try and make a spot in the Test team his own. If he piles on a mountain of runs then it’s going to be pretty hard to leave him out for the Ashes.”

Hussey, who was considered as one of the greatest in his position, recalled his experience of playing at the spot and said, “It’s actually quite a tricky role to play because it is hard to get consistency. You have to play in a variety of different situations. Sometimes you come in and the team’s in trouble and you have to resurrect the innings. Sometimes they’re about to take the second new ball, sometimes you’re trying to eke out runs with the tail, sometimes you need to score quickly.”

"On BJP’s mind now: Inroads into Maratha, Muslim areas in Maharashtra","CM Devendra Fadnavis with core committee members of the state BJP during a meeting at Vasant Smriti, the party office in Dadar, on Wednesday. (Express Photo: Prashant Nadkar) CM Devendra Fadnavis with core committee members of the state BJP during a meeting at Vasant Smriti, the party office in Dadar, on Wednesday. (Express Photo: Prashant Nadkar)

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to make inroads into the areas dominated by Maratha and Muslim communities to expand its electoral base in Maharashtra. On the first day of the two-day state BJP executive meeting that commenced Wednesday, the party deliberated that it should focus on the untapped segments and constituents.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call on ‘New India’ and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s ‘Modern Maharashtra’ mantra will be the central theme of our conclave,” a senior BJP functionary told The Indian Express.

The conclave that started in the backdrop of serious corruption charges against state BJP president Raosaheb Danve and Housing Minister Prakash Mehta is unlikely to see any action against the leaders.

According to political managers in the party, the central leadership of the BJP is seized of the matter. “The chief minister had ordered a probe. If the report shows they are guilty, action will be taken at an appropriate time,” said a leader.

Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who was removed from state cabinet following allegations of impropriety, has been demanding to be absolved of the charges if there is no action against others facing similar cases. At its internal party meeting, a decision had been taken not to allow the conclave to become a forum for discussing individual cases.

The political managers said the meeting would not “deviate from the stated agenda of developmental politics emphasising on inclusive growth”.

“At the end of the 58th and last Maratha rally, the state government extended Rs 800-crore sops in various educational schemes — similar to the ones enjoyed by the OBCs — to the community. The government has also provided sops in the education sector to various economically backward people within the minorities,” said a party leader.

The Marathas constitute 33 per cent of the state’s population and Muslims 10 to 12 per cent. The party, which is commemorating the centenary celebrations of RSS/BJP ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay, has also been speaking propagating the latter’s theory of ‘integral humanism’. The BJP believes efforts made towards this would appeal to the masses, especially the generation next.

The state and Central governments have introduced several public welfare schemes named after Upadhyay. The most popular among them are Deendayal Upadhyay Antodaya Yojana, Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana, Deendayal Upadhyay Kaushalya Yojana and Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Sadak Yojana, among others.

Kenya’s Raila Odinga calls strike as he mulls options,"Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga. (Source: Reuters) Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga. (Source: Reuters)

Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga has urged his supporters to stay home from work on Monday to mourn those killed in protests over what he claims was a rigged election, while he mulls his next move. Government officials have urged citizens to return to work, after days of anxiety since last Tuesday’s election left Nairobi — a bustling city of more than three million people — near-deserted. On Sunday, life appeared to slowly be returning to normal with businesses opening and deadly protests that erupted Friday night after the election result fizzling out as Odinga’s supporters await his next move.

At least 16 people have died in protests in Odinga’s strongholds, according to an AFP tally, many shot dead by police.

“We are not done yet. We will not give up. Wait for the next course of action which I will announce the day after tomorrow (Tuesday),” Odinga told a crowd of thousands in Nairobi’s slum Kibera on Sunday.

“Do not go to work tomorrow. Let us mourn the innocent people killed by police.”

It was his first appearance since the election commission (IEBC) on Friday declared President Uhuru Kenyatta the victor of a vote that Odinga says was rigged.

The 72-year-old and his National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition believe he was the rightful winner, and that results which came in via an electronic tallying system were hacked and manipulated.

Foreign observers praised election day as peaceful and credible and expressed confidence in the IEBC, but have not commented on the counting process.

The United Nations, Britain and the European Union have beseeched Odinga to send out a message to restrain his supporters from protesting, and instead use legal means to address his concerns.

In asking his supporters to stay home, he also urged them to avoid police, but many are hanging on for instructions come Tuesday.

“It was quiet and we were worried, because we did not know the plan. Now, we’re very ready for whatever will come,” said Duncan Nyamo, an Odinga supporter in Kibera. “We are ready to die.”

Politics in Kenya is largely divided along tribal lines, and the winner-takes-all nature of elections has long stoked communal divisions.

Three of Kenya’s four presidents have been Kikuyu and the other Kalenjin, leaving Luos and other major ethnic groups feeling excluded from power and marginalised for over half a century.

In 2007, Odinga and his allies claimed an election was stolen by Mwai Kibaki — a Kikuyu. Foreign observers agreed there had been irregularities.

Even as residents of areas along SV Road in the western suburbs continue to demand that the Metro 2B project be constructed underground, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has said their proposal is not feasible.

“It is not possible to construct the corridor underground. Wherever it is feasible to construct underground we will do that. The Airport Metro, connecting the international airport with the Navi Mumbai airport, and the Metro 7 extension till the airport will be constructed underground,” said Additional Metropolitan Commissioner Pravin Darade.

A senior MMRDA official added, “Constructing a Metro underground will increase the cost by over three times, making it financially not feasible.” Meanwhile, the residents have stepped up their protests and are collecting signatures to be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office.

“We will send our signed petitions to the PMO to press for our demands. We have already received over 500 signatures and will get a few thousands more,” said Jamila Dadarkar, a Khar resident.

The residents have been protesting the construction of Metro 2B, connecting Dahisar with Mankhurd, ever since the project was announced. “We are going to fight together till the end. But if they are not even going to lend us an ear then it will be totally unfair to us. This is absolute autocracy. For constructing an elevated corridor, they will have to bring down two foot overbridges that they constructed for over Rs 4 crore. Is that not a waste of public money?” Dadarkar asked.

BJP leaders also acknowledged the Bhikkhu Mahasangh’s role in garnering Dalit votes to help pave way for the party’s stunning victory in the UP elections earlier this year.

Among senior BJP leaders present at Wednesday’s programme was party’s organisation general secretary Shiv Prakash. RSS joint secretary Krishna Gopal was also expected to attend the conference, convened by BJP MP Udit Raj and held at the Constitution Club in the national capital.

The public acknowledgment and the appreciation expressed by the leaders for the six-month-long Dhamma Chetna Yatra ahead of the elections come at a time when the BJP is reinforcing its bids to consolidate its Dalit support base across the country, especially in UP, where the BSP is losing the grip on the community that has been its committed vote base.

“Dhamma Viriyo (former head of the organisation) had been a great strength to the phenomenon of change,” BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said at the event. Yadav and Shiv Prakash acknowledged the monk’s role in the campaign for BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

During the Dhamma Chetna Yatra, organised with the help of BJP and addressed, among others, by party chief Amit Shah and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Viriyo had addressed over 4 million people — mostly Dalits and OBCs, the BJP leaders said. Most of these meetings, they emphasised, were held in areas considered the BSP’s strongholds.

Union Minister of State for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale, who spoke at length about Modi’s respect for Buddhism, said, “Dhamma Viriyo had a significant role in bringing the BJP to power in UP.” Stressing that the BJP is keen to uplift Dalit communities, Athawale asserted that there will not be any move by the government to take away reservation for Dalits.

Athawale also claimed that the BJP’s moves to “honour Ambedkar” has led to an increasing awareness among Dalits about his ideology and personality.

Athawale announced that Ram Nath Kovind, India’s second Dalit President, whose election is also seen as a significant development in the ruling party’s attempts to reach out to Dalits, could attend a programme in Bodh Gaya on November 3 to pay tribute to Dhamma Viriyo.

At Wednesday’s event, speaker after speaker from the Buddhist organisation praised Modi, his commitment to work for Dalits, and his regard for Ambedkar.

Theatre as temple,"Actress Jennifer Kendal in film 36 CHOWEINGHEE LANE. Express archive photo Actress Jennifer Kendal in film 36 CHOWEINGHEE LANE. Express archive photo

My mother Jennifer Kapoor once wrote of her childhood, “In my birth certificate my father was described as an actor with no fixed abode. I always found this romantic and something to be intensely proud of… My first memories are of the smell of grease-paint, dust, the perspiration of terrified actors.” This was the family I grew up in. A family whose “founding pillars” were Geoffrey Kendal and Prithviraj Kapoor, both adventurers who lived life on their own terms and were passionate about theatre.

Geoffrey Kendal, my British pacifist grandfather, experienced India in his thirties with ENSA (Entertainment National Services Association) which entertained the troops during the Second World War. And fell in love with it. He made India his home for the next 30 years, travelling with his theatre company across the length and breadth of the country with his actress wife Laura Lidell and daughters, Jennifer and Felicity.

I adored my grandfather, Geoffrey. He wrote in his autobiography, Shakespeare Wallah, “Being an actor must be the best job in the world. It combines all the things that a person need look for: Health, romance, travel, the fun of the lottery, the positive tragedy of failure, and the will to overcome it. It provides good companionship, and interest in literature, architecture, music, and dancing — in short, just about everything that most people strive for.”

My mother was brought to India aged 13 by her parents with their itinerant theatre company Shakespeareana. She went on to make India her home with her marriage to my father, and lived the rest of her life here. My mother always told me of her deep love of India, because as she put it, “Every 20 km you would come across a change in language, food, dress, customs, stories, songs, buildings, even the design of the bullock carts and look of the cows changed.” This immense variety, this richness that ran through the expanse of India is what she loved more than anything else. And that there was still a thread of familiarity that wove itself through this dazzling un-sameness made it all the more attractive.

Sadly, today I believe this “un-sameness” that my mother celebrated, is what the powers-that-be are using to breed hatred, fracturing the very core of our country.

But this fear and hatred towards the unfamiliar is not something unique to India. Look across the globe and one finds right-wing chauvinism, xenophobia and phony nationalism growing at an astonishing pace.

The world needs a new world order. It also needs its philosophers, its storytellers and its poets who show us ways of being beyond the mundane and banal. Who shine the light on the great achievements of modern mankind and yet equip us to deal with the dark side, the inevitable fallouts of technological advancements, globalisation, political machinations, media manipulations, as well as to embrace our fears, to have moral courage.

Violence and hatred are so much easier.

Both my grandfathers loved India dearly. Prithviraj Kapoor hailed from the North West Frontier Province, from Peshawar. He made Bombay his home, where he entered the film industry and became the patriarch of the Kapoor family in Indian cinema. But few people know that at the height of his stardom in 1944, Prithviraj Kapoor responded to the need of the hour by reaching out to the people on a variety of issues and concerns that needed to be urgently addressed.

He chose to do this, not through cinema but through theatre, which he believed could touch the lives of people more directly than cinema could. Thus was born Prithvi Theatres. This professional travelling theatre company produced plays on issues ranging from the plight of farmers, to predicting Partition and its consequences, the relationship between Hindus and Muslims, the role of the arts in a new India and so much more. The motto of the theatre company was Kala Desh Ki Seva Mein. Arts in the service of the nation.

You can imagine India in 1944, the political fervour that gripped the nation. And here was this colossus of a film star travelling with his theatre company in third class train compartments across India, spreading his beliefs and igniting the imagination of his audiences towards nation-building.

Over a decade later as a Rajya Sabha member (where he served two terms as the President’s nominee), he spoke fervently of the need to create spaces for the arts across the country. This is what he said in the Rajya Sabha, “Theatre is a wonderful thing. It is the greatest temple on earth. In that temple, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jew, Sikh and Parsee, all get together. Nobody comes and asks who is in the next chair. A Pandit sits with a Mullah. A Communist friend may sit with a Socialist friend. All sit together. It is a beautiful way of bringing people together and teaching them how to behave. They would laugh together, cry together. It is the biggest temple that could be built for the benefit of the nation.”

Today we are still far, far away from realising this dream.

I am committed to working towards realising this dream, in whatever small way within my power. Not only because theatre gives me joy but because I know and understand its immense capacity to transform individuals and thereby build communities.

I know I belong to the minority and am swimming against the tide. I also know I live in fear, in this new India, because I am a woman, I eat beef, I drink alcohol, I follow a faith that gives me solace and helps me make sense of the world around me. I wear clothes that make me feel good, I believe who I choose to love is my own business, I value debate and discussion and opposing views as long as I am not intimidated and dictated to, and I believe all this does not make me anti-national. But in today’s India, I may be very wrong.

Sadly, I cannot say I live in a 70-year-old India today that is moving towards an enlightened civilisation that I am proud of. My reality is one of great privilege in this country and is yet wrought with fear and uncertainty and struggle. All I can say is that the time has come to break the silence and unite with others who too stand up against this insidious devouring of our values. And to quietly, bravely yet firmly say, Not in My Name.

"‘Poets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion’: Kiriti Sengupta","“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) “You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this — the state of a poet’s being — the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem’s purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem’s composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

“I think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,” Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no “great intention” when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of “changing the society” through his poems. “Poetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,” he added.

Sengupta’s “My Glass of Wine” is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India’s first poetry trilogy, “Dreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral”, which also bears two other works, “The Reverse Tree” and “Healing Waters Floating Lamps”. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,” quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer’s bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

“I’ve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don’t find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets’ work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,” he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible “to earn a living from writing poetry” in India. “Poets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,” said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled “Solitary Stillness” and is due to be published in August.

WATCH: This SCARY post-workout cramp video has over 15 mn views,"“Looked like a… alien in my damn leg was gonna bust out”, wrote Angel Bermudez in a comment under the video. (Source: Angel Bermudez/Facebook) “Looked like a… alien in my damn leg was gonna bust out”, wrote Angel Bermudez in a comment under the video. (Source: Angel Bermudez/Facebook)

Everyone (almost) at some point or the other would have experienced a cramp in their leg, be it after a workout or even in the middle of the night, if you’ve slept awkwardly. More often than not you’d wait the pain out or walk it off, but recording a video of it would hardly come to your mind. Nevertheless, it did to Angel Bermudez, from California, US, whose post-workout cramp video is SO scary that it’s got over 15 million views in just three days.

Bermudez has his right leg propped up on the dashboard of a car, and one can see the muscles cramping and uncramping for 52 seconds. The sheer pain of the cramps is audible in Bermudez’s voice as he says, “this is what a cramp looks like”. The video has him cringing in pain as the cramp settles down, and the calf really does look scary as if something is moving under the skin. Responding to a comment on the video, Bermudez wrote, “Looked like a god d*mn alien in my damn leg was gonna bust out”, and we agree!

Watch the video here.



In case you didn’t know, cramps are quite common, and is the result of the muscles contracting forcibly and involuntarily without relaxing. Mild cramps usually last a couple of seconds, while more severe ones can last up to several hours. Ouch! In the latter’s case, the msucles can contract to form a lump or knot under the skin, which is what seems to have happened in Bermudez’s case.

Drinking water before, during and after your workout, and keeping yourself hydrated is usually a good way to avoid muscle cramps.

Dadi watches all of them and says that if the husbands have chosen the right one, then they can tell her too. The jeweller gives their family necklace to Suvarna. Kartik thinks that Suvarna wants the necklace and snatches it away from her. He shouts as to how could they give this to her when he especially told them not to. Naira says that they got it repolished for Keerti, she could make this out from Suvarna’s innocent eyes. Dadi agrees and Kartik apologises to Suvarna. Manish and Suvarna give the necklace to Keerti together.

Bhua Dadi comes to meet Rukmani while she’s sleeping and asks if they’re doing the right thing. Rukmani says that nothing will go wrong and Keerti will also understand their point.

US Vice President Mike Pence today condemned far-right groups that staged a rally in Virginia that descended into deadly violence, saying there is “no tolerance for hate and violence.”

“We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo Nazis or the KKK,” Pence said in response to a question at a news conference in Cartagena, Colombia, where he was on the first leg of a Latin American tour.

“These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.”

Pence’s comments were in contrast to those of President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the violence Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he failed to explicitly condemn white supremacists.

North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un briefed on Guam missile plan: KCNA,"A man watches a TV screen showing a local news program reporting about North Korean military’s plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam, at Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) A man watches a TV screen showing a local news program reporting about North Korean military’s plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam, at Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been briefed on a plan to fire missiles near Guam but hinted that he would hold off on the launch, Pyongyang’s state media said Tuesday. Kim “examined the plan for a long time” and “discussed it” with commanding officers yesterday during his inspection of the command of the Strategic Force in charge of the North’s missile units, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

He said that “the US imperialists caught the noose around their necks due to their reckless military confrontation racket”. But Kim hinted he would hold off on the plan to test-fire missiles towards the US Pacific island territory, saying he would “watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees spending a hard time of every minute of their miserable lot”.

“In order to defuse the tensions and prevent the dangerous military conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is necessary for the US to make a proper option first and show it through action, as it committed provocations after introducing huge nuclear strategic equipment into the vicinity of the peninsula”, he was quoted as saying by KCNA. He urged the US to “stop at once arrogant provocations” against the North and not provoke it any longer.

North Korea’s military said last week that it would finalise by mid-August its detailed plan to test-fire four intermediate-range ballistic missiles in an “enveloping fire” around Guam and report it to its leader for approval. Tensions have been mounting since the North tested two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which appeared to bring much of the US within range.

Responding to the tests, US President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang of “fire and fury like the world has never seen”. The North in turn threatened to test-fire its missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam. The war of words has sparked global alarm, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides.

South Korean President Moon Jae-In also waded in on yesterday, calling for calm in the standoff with North Korea, saying there should never be another war on the peninsula. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned yesterday that an attack against the United States could quickly escalate into war, as he and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to dial down tensions.

Mattis’s comments came after they said in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal that America has “no interest” in regime change in Pyongyang or the accelerated reunification of the two Koreas, and stressed the importance of a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The two statesmen decided to write the piece a couple of weeks ago, and it had not been in response to last week’s heated rhetoric, Mattis said.

Mattis and Tillerson said the United States favours a diplomatic solution to the nuclear stand-off, especially with help from China, though they stressed diplomacy is “backed by military options.”

Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer to miss league start against Bayer Leverkusen,"“Manuel Neuer will not be playing tomorrow”, Carlo Ancelotti told reporters on Thursday. (Source: File) “Manuel Neuer will not be playing tomorrow”, Carlo Ancelotti told reporters on Thursday. (Source: File)

Bayern Munich will be without goalkeeper Manuel Neuer when the Bundesliga season gets under way with the champions’ first league match against Bayer Leverkusen on Friday, coach Carlo Ancelotti said.

Germany keeper Neuer broke a bone in his foot in April and has since been working on his comeback but Friday’s league opener will come too soon, according to the Italian coach.

“Manuel Neuer will not be playing tomorrow,” Ancelotti told reporters on Thursday. “We will not take any risks.” Bayern, the pre-season favourites, will launch their bid for a record-extending sixth straight Bundesliga title, having easily shaken off any domestic opposition in the past few seasons.

But they will be without a string of injured players, including Jerome Boateng, Thiago Alcantara, Javi Martinez and new signing James Rodriguez among other when they take on Leverkusen.

“We have injured players but that is not a big problem,” Ancelotti said. However, the coach, in his second season in Munich, will have David Alaba and Arjen Robben back as they have recovered from their injuries. “Both are in a good condition. But I will decide on the lineup tomorrow,” Ancelotti said.

Mark Stoneman replaces Keaton Jennings in England squad for Day-Night Test vs West Indies,"England’s Dawid Malan and Mark Stoneman play football during nets. (Source: Reuters) England’s Dawid Malan and Mark Stoneman play football during nets. (Source: Reuters)

England announced the squad for the upcoming three-match Test series against West Indies with Mark Stoneman as the only change after the series against South Africa. The Surrey opener will be replacing struggling Keaton Jennings.

With Toby Roland-Jones keeping his place as the third seamer, captain Joe Root said on Sky Sports, “Chris Woakes and Mason Crane are the two guys who will miss out. I think it’s a great opportunity for the rest of the guys to experience a pink ball Test match for the first time and we’re really excited.”

The skipper added that Woakes needed more time to regain fitness. “He will have definitely wanted to play here but with the lack of game time he’s had, it felt like another week of loading up on overs making sure he’s absolutely ready coming back from a serious injury is important,” Root said. “That’s where we’re at at the minute and I think Toby deserves his opportunity.”

Stoneman will be making his debut in England’s first day-night Test match. “He’s obviously got a huge amount of runs under his belt, this season in particular, and in previous seasons as well. He’s got a well-rounded game, he’s a bit more experienced having played a lot of county cricket and I’m excited to see him hopefully take his opportunity.”

Having said that, Root was not sure how long Stoneman would have to make his mark. “Who knows. Ideally you want someone to come in and set

the world alight and their career move forward from there. I’d like to think he would get a very good opportunity and some good game time with England.

“Of course you want it (the top order) to be settled. You never want to go into any series with the guys out of form or under pressure but that’s one of the challenges of Test cricket and generally as a side we’ve responded quite well to that in the past. This is a great opportunity for him (Stoneman) to go out

and show everyone how good a player he is.”

The Chief’s Strategy,"BJP chief Amit Shah (PTI/Files) BJP chief Amit Shah (PTI/Files)

In India, under the first-past-the-post electoral system, election strategies often take a perverse shape and eventually end in the fragmentation of the society. Of late, some professional agencies have emerged, which present ready-made data on caste lines and promote easy exploitation of the societal fragmentation via vote-bank politics. In this backdrop, when BJP president Amit Shah employed a unifying strategy, while giving demonstrable representation to all major sections of the society, in the selection of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections in UP in 2014 and again, for the Vidhan Sabha in 2017, many Doubting Thomases wondered whether it will work.

But Shah had the last laugh. The BJP romped home with a resounding victory in both the elections, vindicating Shah’s vibgyor strategy. Today, one can’t deny that Shah’s insightful handling of this strategy resulted in the BJP becoming a rallying point for all the non-Yadav OBC communities. It gave the party an unbeatable edge in UP.

Shah created a record of sorts in Gujarat, winning practically every assembly election with a record margin. He has a penchant for setting targets that may appear implausible to some, but motivating to many others. This has prompted his colleagues to “think big” and strive hard to achieve the target. Fighting to win has been the mantra of Shah. He is known to take every election very seriously. He relishes taking on tough challenges. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he does not rest and also refuses to let others rest.

In UP, prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, he had travelled to almost all tehsil places, staying at government rest houses. When cadres see their leader fighting a battle with utmost seriousness and sincerity, they also refrain from shirking responsibilities. He is more than convinced that howsoever important is the role of popular perception in winning elections, there is no alternative to strengthening the party’s booth units. The grand victories of the BJP in UP in 2014 and 2017 are credited to Shah’s emphasis on constituting a 21-member committee at almost every booth. He ensured that these booth committees remain active all through the year.

In fact, the party has made it mandatory that at least six important party programmes are conducted at every booth, and in the process, has ensured a live-wire party organisation at the grass roots. This has also made the election more karyakarta centric and proportionately less dependent on satraps.

Come any election, Amitbhai literally burns the midnight oil. He keeps a tab on every department. Late night meetings to review ground situation and early morning assessments of media coverage are routine during electioneering. Alert to the progressive unfolding of the ground situation, Shah believes in a rally to rally strategy. Every rally has a customised message and points relevant to the place where the rally is held. What is also remarkable is his understanding of the strengths and limitations of media and advertising. He is known for his dexterity in the selection of the right media for the right message.

In UP, he adroitly employed social media, mainly Facebook and WhatsApp, to shape public opinion. Informally organised WhatsApp groups involving more than 17 lakh readers were the bedrock of his opinion-forming strategy. The beauty of his communication strategy was its two-way approach. Through “UP ke mann ki baat” he compiled suggestions from crores of voters. Many issues raised by the BJP in its UP election manifesto — from banning illegal slaughter houses to setting up anti-Romeo squads — emerged from this innovative crowd sourcing.

Shah’s handling of coalition politics has also been remarkable. Not averse to the idea of joining hands with other parties wherever required, he has always ensured that such alliances are not made at the cost of the BJP’s long-term interests. Having won assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, among others, Shah has his eyes set on 2019.

Shah knows not just the hows of electoral successes, but also its whys. For instance, he said the BJP’s UP win is the defeat of the politics of corruption, casteism and nepotism. He neither gets disillusioned by reverses nor is he overwhelmed by success. Which is why, even after bringing a record 18 states under the control of the BJP, his focus on building the party has not shifted.

Shah understands that to make India Congress-mukt, it first has to be BJP-yukt!

"Given current relations, issue of US detainees not a subject of discussion: North Korea","Protesters shout slogans near a banner showing an illustrations of U.S. President Donald Trump as they march toward the U.S. Embassy after a rally demanding peace on the Korean peninsula in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017.

North Korea appeared to link the fate of its US prisoners to ongoing tensions today, saying now is not the right time to discuss their release. Three Americans, accused of various crimes against the state, are behind bars in the hermit nation, which is engaged in a tense standoff with the administration of US President Donald Trump over its banned missile and nuclear weapons programs.

“The issue of detained Americans is not a subject of discussion given the current state of… relations,” a spokesman for the North’s foreign ministry was quoted as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Pyongyang has arrested and jailed several US citizens in the past decade, often releasing them only after high-profile visits by US officials or former presidents. In June, student Otto Warmbier — who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for allegedly stealing a political poster while visiting Pyongyang as a tourist — was sent home in a coma. He died a week later. His release was secured through back channel negotiations with Pyongyang led by the US envoy for North Korea policy Joseph Yun. Media reports over the weekend suggested similar talks have continued. Last week, the North released a Canadian pastor on medical parole after having held him for more than two years.

Tensions have been mounting between Washington and Pyongyang since the North’s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles that appeared to bring much of the US within range. Responding to the tests, Trump warned the North of “fire and fury like the world has never seen”, while Pyongyang threatened to fire missiles close to the US territory of Guam.

On Tuesday, leader Kim Jong-Un said he would hold off the planned missile strike, but warned the highly provocative move would go ahead in the event of further “reckless actions” by Washington.

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman orders Qatar border be reopened to Mecca pilgrims: Reports,"Muslim pilgrims prepare themselves for Friday prayers in front of the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty) Muslim pilgrims prepare themselves for Friday prayers in front of the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty)

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered that the border with Qatar be reopened to allow pilgrims to carry out their annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, official state media said today. The decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5.

The border decision came after the kingdom’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency. The king has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed “to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,” it said. He even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport “to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses”.

The crown prince emphasised the “historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar”, the statement added.

Qatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims’ safety. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting “terrorists” and of being too close to Iran.

Qatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy. The tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 per cent of them foreigners, ranks as the world’s richest on a per-capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund. It holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.

"Did tell Tripura CM Manik Sarkar to reshape his Independence Day speech, Prasar Bharati admits","Chief Minister of Tripura Manik Sarkar. (Express Photo) Chief Minister of Tripura Manik Sarkar. (Express Photo)

A day after Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar’s office said his Independence Day address was not aired by Doordarshan and All India Radio, which wanted him to “reshape” it, The Indian Express has learnt that Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan and AIR, did convey to Sarkar on August 15 morning what he shouldn’t say in his speech.

Part of Sarkar’s unaired speech targeted the BJP — he heads a Left Front government in the state.

Without naming any political party or organisation, Sarkar’s speech mentioned that the “spirit of secularism is under attack” and “conspiracies and attempts are under way to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religion country and in the name of protecting the cow”. Read | Doordarshan, AIR blacked out my Independence Day speech, told me reshape it: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar

The speech also referred to minorities and Dalits being “under severe attack” and how “their sense of security is being shattered”. Prasar Bharati was asked by its officials in Tripura to suggest what to do, and its senior officials in Delhi decided that the Chief Minister’s speech was against the Broadcast Code.

On the evening of August 14, Doordarshan and All India Radio had recorded Sarkar’s speech. U K Sahoo, Doordarshan’s protocol officer who was present during the recording, told The Indian Express that after the recording, he was asked by the Chief Minister to “maintain the quality and content” of his speech.

Sahoo felt that the speech was controversial, but Sarkar’s words meant he could not edit it. He spoke to officials at Doordarshan’s directorate in New Delhi who asked him to send across the text of the speech. Similar to Doordarshan, the text of Sarkar’s speech was also sent to All India Radio’s headquarters in New Delhi.

At the AIR headquarters, a committee of four senior officers pondered on the contents of the speech. AIR Director General Fayyaz Sheheryar consulted Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati on what should be done. Read the Manik Sarkar speech that did not pass the AIR test

The committee and Vempati decided that the speech did not adhere to the Broadcast Code, and told their office in Agartala that the Chief Minister will need to “reshape the content” of his speech, otherwise the “broadcast may not go with its existing content”, keeping in view the “sanctity and solemnity” of Independence Day.

Senior officials at Prasar Bharati maintained that the public broadcaster never asks “suo motu” for speeches of Chief Ministers. Sanjiv Dosajh, Assistant Director of Programmes (Policy) at AIR, who emailed AIR’s Agartala office about the committee’s decision, told The Indian Express that when the station director finds some content “objectionable”, the speech is sent to the directorate in Delhi.

Dosajh said in the past too, CMs have been advised to “modify” some speeches, to which they agreed — he cited no example. “This time,” Dosajh said of Sarkar, “he was very firm he would not change (it)”.

He said the committee found a few “instances” in Sarkar’s speech which were not “very positive”, keeping in mind the occasion. He said the AIR broadcast code says “speech should not be hostile” which, the committee felt, was the case with Sarkar’s speech.

But the AIR and Doordarshan’s Broadcast Code does not mention “hostile speech” at all. It says that no content should be aired that criticises friendly countries, attacks any religion or community, is obscene or defamatory, incites violence or goes against law and order, amounts to contempt of court, casts aspersions against the integrity of the President or judiciary, or can affect the integrity of the country and criticises any person by name.

On receiving the response from their directorates, both Doordarshan and AIR informed the Tripura Chief Minister’s office about the decision. Sahoo said he had emailed the Chief Minister’s staff on the evening of August 14, but did not receive a response. Editorial | Censoring Manik Sarkar

The next morning, between 9 am and 9.30 am, when both the Governor’s and the Chief Minister’s speeches were to be broadcast, only the Governor’s speech was aired. In a press statement Wednesday, Doordarshan said that it did cover Sarkar’s Independence Day-related events, including another speech he made on August 15.

The CPI(M) criticised the government for not airing Sarkar’s speech. Party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, at a press conference, said the Prime Minister or the Chief Ministers have the right to speak. “If they have said anything objectionable, they will be questioned in Parliament or in state legislatures. What the Chief Minister would have said in his address, that would have been questioned on the floor of the Tripura Assembly. You cannot pre-emptively censor him.”

Calling it worse than the Emergency days, he said what Prasar Bharati has done is “reminiscent not only of the Emergency of Indira Gandhi… when there was censorship of a very high level… this has gone further than that and worse than that.”

Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, told reporters: “With each passing day, it has become very hard for the Opposition parties to make their voice reach the people of the country. This type of censorship has been seen by no country in the world. This is shameful for this government. Why don’t they declare Emergency straightaway for the news censorship of the media, so that at least we will have some solace, we will have some sort of satisfaction: OK, nothing can come because there is Emergency, nothing comes because this is prohibited.”

Religious freedom under attack in Pakistan: US,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. File US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. File

The religious freedom is under attack in Pakistan, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said and hoped that the new prime minister would promote interfaith harmony in the country. Releasing a Congressional-mandated 2016 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom yesterday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Pakistan government marginalises Ahmadiyya Muslims, and refuses to recognise them as Muslim.

“Religious freedom is under attack in Pakistan, where more than two dozen are on death row or serving a life imprisonment for blasphemy,” he said.

Tillerson hoped that new Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and his government will promote interfaith harmony and protect the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan. Abbasi, 58, was sworn-in as Pakistan’s prime minister on August 1 after the Supreme Court disqualified the incumbent Nawaz Sharif for dishonesty following the Panama papers case. The US report said that in 2016 there continued to be violence and abuses committed by armed sectarian groups connected to organisations banned by the government, including Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, and Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat, as well as abuses by individuals and groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US and other governments, such as ISIL-Khorasan.

According to the State Department, members of religious minority communities said there continued to be inconsistent application of laws safeguarding minority rights and enforcement of protections of religious minorities at both the federal and provincial levels by the federal Ministry of Law, Justice, and Human Rights and its provincial counterparts.

“Religious minorities said they remained concerned that government action to address coerced conversions of religious minorities to Islam was inadequate,” the report said.

Religious minority activists, however, said they believed the Sindh Assembly’s new law criminalizing forced conversions, which passed in November but was under review by the Sindh Assembly at year’s end, would be a step to restrict the practice and better protect minors belonging to religious minorities, it added.

Religious minority community leaders said the government failed to take adequate action to protect minorities from bonded labor in the brick-making and agricultural sectors, an illegal practice in which victims were disproportionately Christians and Hindus, according to the report. According to Hindu and Sikh leaders, the legal uncertainty surrounding the process of registering marriages for their communities continued to create difficulties for Hindu and Sikh women in obtaining their inheritances, accessing health services, voting, obtaining a passport, and buying or selling property, the report added.

US Donald Trump signs bill expanding college assistance for veterans,"US President Donald Trump. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/Files) US President Donald Trump. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/Files)

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law an updated veterans’ education bill that marks the largest expansion of college assistance for military veterans in a decade. The Forever GI Act immediately removed a 15-year time limit on the use of GI benefits. The measure also increases financial assistance for thousands serving in the National Guard and Reserve, building on a 2008 law that guaranteed veterans a full-ride scholarship to any in-state public university, or a similar cash amount to attend private colleges.

Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who joined Trump for the signing, said the new law also provides benefits to Purple Heart recipients whose injuries forced them to leave the service. Benefits can also now be transferred to the eligible dependent of service members who are killed in the line of duty.

Veterans would get additional payments for completing science, technology and engineering courses, part of a broad effort to better prepare veterans for life after active-duty service amid a fast-changing job market. The law also restores benefits if a college closes in the middle of the semester, a protection that was added after thousands of veterans were hurt by the collapse of for-profit college giant ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges.

“This is expanding our ability to support our veterans in getting education,” Shulkin told reporters at a briefing after Trump signed the measure at his New Jersey golf club upon returning there after two nights at his home at New York’s Trump Tower. Journalists were not permitted to watch Trump sign the bill, as the White House has done for earlier veterans’ legislation he has turned into law. That includes a measure Trump signed at the club Saturday to provide nearly $4 billion in emergency funding for a temporary veterans health care program.

Wednesday’s signing came the day after Trump was soundly rebuked for continuing to insist that “both sides” were culpable for an outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators. One woman was killed.

A wide range of veterans groups supported the education measure. The Veterans of Foreign Wars says hundreds of thousands stand to benefit.

Student Veterans of America says that only about half of the 200,000 service members who leave the military each year go on to enroll in college, while surveys indicate that veterans often outperform peers in the classroom. “Taking care of our veterans includes empowering them with the opportunity to succeed,” said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. “We applaud President Trump for his continued dedication to helping veterans and support of meaningful reform.”

The expanded educational benefits would be paid for by bringing living stipend payments under the GI Bill down to a similar level as that received by an active-duty member, whose payments were reduced in 2014 by 1 percent a year for five years. Total government spending on the GI Bill is expected to be more than $100 billion over 10 years.

Federal policeman to head Australia’s anti-doping watchdog,"Australia is also looking to set up a national anti-doping tribunal independent of sports federations. (Source: File) Australia is also looking to set up a national anti-doping tribunal independent of sports federations. (Source: File)

David Sharpe, a career policeman, and former rugby league administrator has been appointed head of Australia’s anti-doping watchdog. Sharpe will take the reins of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) for five years from mid-September, replacing Ben McDevitt, who stepped down in May at the end of his three-year contract, the federal sports ministry said on Thursday.

Sharpe, the assistant commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, has a background in counter-terrorism, security and organised crime. A former professional rugby league player, he was also general manager of National Rugby League team Canberra Raiders for two years.

His predecessor McDevitt was also a career policeman and oversaw Australia’s biggest doping scandal when 34 Australian Rules players were handed two-year bans last year following an investigation into a dubious supplements regime at the Melbourne-based Essendon Football Club.

Among Sharpe’s first tasks will be to ensure Australia hosts a clean Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next year. “The integrity of Australian sport is important to all Australians and ASADA’s deterrence, detection and enforcement role to prevent doping in sport is critical,” federal sports minister Greg Hunt said in a statement.

“As we get closer to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, we all want to see athletes do well and achieve their potential but we also want to continue to be confident that all competition is clean and fair.

“Mr Sharpe’s experience in senior leadership roles in law enforcement and sports administration will ensure ASADA continues to play its vital role in protecting the integrity of Australian sport.”

Australia is also looking to set up a national anti-doping tribunal independent of sports federations, in the same vein as the global Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

The sports ministry has pushed for an independent tribunal in the wake of the Essendon case, which saw the players cleared by the Australian Football League’s integrity panel but later banned when the World Anti-Doping Agency referred the case to CAS.

Fitness is not just a habit, it is a lifestyle; one that requires commitment and dedication so dont let monsoon dampen your spirits. Some quick and easy steps like working out indoors or getting few simpler exercising devices can do the trick for you, say experts.

Reebok Master Trainer Gagan Arora encourages you to keep your body engine fueled every day, with these simple things to keep in mind during rainy days.

* Run those miles: The body is waterproof so do not fret to take those extra laps in the rain. An outdoor workout keeps the body metabolism going and helps you stay fit and energized.

* Stay active through the day: If heading out in the rain is not your cup of tea, workout indoors. Pack in a short 30 – 40 minutes schedule that includes a mix of squats, push-ups, planks. Apart from homemade food, add seasonal fruits and vegetables along with lean meat and legumes to your diet.

* The ‘Right’ Gear: Wear bright coloured speed wick or Active Chill fitness gear and socks as they will keep you cool during humidity, dry quickly and reduce the chances of chaffing.

* Monsoon gateways: Take a break from your routine and unwind with a quick getaway during the rains. Plan a fun ‘Fitcation’ that includes long walks and fun outdoor games with family and friends to stay active, energized and light this monsoon.

* Vitamins are vital – Add vitamins to your diet to keep infections at bay and maintain your energy levels. Get enough rest, stay indoors and relax if not feeling well.

Additionally, Meenakshi Subramaniyam, coach at HealthifyMe.com also added few tips.

* Stick to the same time plan for workout sessions at home. Make sure the session is 45 minutes at least.

* Start with simple stretching exercises to warm-up followed by five minutes spot jogging. Follow it up with 15 minutes of rigorous cardio to get the heart beat up and start the fat burning process. One can opt for skipping, stair climbing, hopping, jumping jacks etc. To strengthen body muscles for toning the body and preventing joints from injury, do a combination of 20 squats + 20 lunges (each leg) + 20 pushups. You repeat this set 2-4 times as per your capacity.

* Get few simple exercising devices like dumbells, skipping rope, resistance tubes etc at home and try hardcore floor exercises like planks, crunches and leg raises. You can start with a plank position for 30 seconds and repeat it again. Then lie down on your back and do 20 crunches + 20 reverse crunches + 20 alternate leg raises. Repeat this set 2 times. An indoor jog on the spot or around a house jog is also beneficial, or Leslie walks which can be done indoors.

* Yoga can be performed both indoors and outdoors. Select an airy spot in your house practice simple asanas to keep yourself fit. Yoga also helps reduce respiratory problems that are very common during the monsoon season.

*Dance workouts are fun and flexible to enjoy indoor monsoon workout.

Egypt’s antiquities ministry says that archaeologists have discovered three tombs dating back more than 2,000 years, from the Ptolemaic Period. The discovery was made in the Nile Valley province of Minya south of Cairo, in an area known as al-Kamin al-Sahrawi.

Yesterday’s statement by the ministry says the unearthed sarcophagi and clay fragments suggest that the area was a large necropolis from sometime between the 27th Dynasty and the Greco-Roman period.

One of the tombs has a burial shaft carved in rock and leads to a chamber where anthropoid lids and four sarcophagi for two women and two men were found. Another tomb contains two chambers; one of them has six burial holes, including one for a child. Excavation work for the third tomb is still underway.

An Australian senator provoked an angry backlash from lawmakers by wearing a burqa in Parliament on Thursday as part of her campaign for a national ban on Islamic face covers. Pauline Hanson, leader of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigration One Nation minor party, sat wearing the black head-to-ankle garment for more than 10 minutes before taking it off as she rose to explain that she wanted such outfits banned on national security grounds.

“There has been a large majority of Australians (who) wish to see the banning of the burka,” said Hanson, an outspoken fan of President Donald Trump, as senators objected. Attorney-General George Brandis drew applause when he said his government would not ban the burqa, and chastised Hanson for what he described as a “stunt” that offended Australia’s Muslim minority.

“To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done,” Brandis said. Opposition Senate leader Penny Wong told Hanson: “It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith; it is another to wear it as a stunt here in the Senate.” Sam Dastyari, an opposition senator and an Iranian-born Muslim, said: “We have seen the stunt of all stunts in this chamber by Sen. Hanson.”

“The close to 500,000 Muslim Australians do not deserve to be targeted, do not deserve to be marginalized, do not deserve to be ridiculed, do not deserve to have their faith made some political point by the desperate leader of a desperate political party,” Dastyari said. Senate President Stephen Parry said Hanson’s identity had been confirmed before she entered the chamber. He also said he would not dictate the standards of dress for the chamber.

"AIIMS 2017 paper leak: CBI registers case, Delhi High Court directs Centre and AIIMS to file replies","Whistleblower Dr Anand Rai alleged that the AIIMS MBBS UG paper was leaked Whistleblower Dr Anand Rai alleged that the AIIMS MBBS UG paper was leaked

The CBI on August 16 told the Delhi High Court that it has registered a case on the alleged leak of question paper for the AIIMS MBBS entrance examination held this year, from an institute in Ghaziabad. The submission was made before a before a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, which was hearing a PIL seeking a court-monitored probe into the alleged illegalities and irregularities during the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) MBBS entrance exam held on May 28 this year.

The agency, in its reply, said that “specific questions in the leaked screen shots were used in SET-3 of shift-2 at exam centre — HR Institute of Technology, Morta, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh”.

“It has also been found that the specific combination and sequence of the questions was randomly and uniquely allocated to a particular candidate,” the affidavit, filed through CBI Special Public Prosecutor Rajdipa Behura, said.

It also said that searches were conducted at the house of a student, the exam centre and its officials. During the course of the investigation, documents and digital evidence were seized, it added. “A regular case was registered on June 13,” the agency said, adding that the “investigation of the case is at the initial stage, five witnesses have been examined and eight documents have been seized so far”.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on September 13 by when the Centre and AIIMS have to file their replies. The CBI was responding to the plea of doctor Anand Rai, who claims to be a whistleblower in the Vyapam scam case, seeking directions to AIIMS to quash the result declared on June 15 for the MBBS exam held on May 28.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, has submitted that the results be only quashed if the probe “reveals that the entrance examination has been entirely and irreversibly vitiated.”

The petition sought direction to AIIMS to produce before the court the finding of the institute’s committee which was constituted for conducting inquiry into the complaints regarding the conduct of the examination.

Rai had on May 31 alleged that the question papers of this year’s entrance exam for MBBS course of the AIIMS were leaked.

He had, in a series of tweets, posted images of question papers of the entrance examination which was held across the country on May 28 and said he had received the snapshots from a source who claimed these were leaked from a college in Lucknow when the online test was going on. Rai had also alleged that AIIMS MBBS seats were being “sold”.

Centene to sell Obamacare plans in Nevada next year: report,"President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

Centene Corp, one of the largest players in the Obamacare individual insurance market, will offer Obamacare plans in 14 rural counties of Nevada in 2018, the Nevada Independent reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Nevada was left without insurance coverage after US health insurer Anthem Inc said last week it would pare back its Obamacare offerings in the state exchange next year.

Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty over the healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump’s administration, who seek to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Centene is among the few large-cap health insurers that have not exited the individual insurance market despite Republican lawmakers’ persistent efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.

In June, the company said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of US counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. Centene, which reported better-than-expected quarterly results late last month, was not immediately available for comment.

Liverpool are fully aware they have to improve defensively but they must strike a balance between tightening up at the back and playing their natural attacking game, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has said.

The Belgian is part of a defence that has already come under fire for their display in the 3-3 draw at Watford in last Saturday’s Premier League opener, when Liverpool conceded a stoppage-time equaliser from a set-piece.

Liverpool’s vulnerability was on display again in their 2-1 Champions League qualification first-leg win over Hoffenheim on Tuesday, when they conceded late on to give the German side hope for next week’s return leg at Anfield.

“We can only play one way and that is forward. We know that we can always score,” Mignolet told British media.

“We took a lot of steps defensively against Hoffenheim. We were solid, set-pieces we defended well too and that is what we have to learn.”

While Liverpool’s pace and attacking flair got them out of trouble several times last season, Mignolet backed his team mates to offer a sterner all-round defensive effort this campaign without ruining their potency up front.

“We are not blind,” he added. “Our natural game will be attacking and we know we have to fill that in with a real defensive spirit. We know that is where we have to improve. “You cannot change a natural footballing side that goes forward, but we know we have to mix that with a good defensive, aggressive spirit to make sure they don’t score the goals.”

Liverpool return to Premier League duty on Saturday when they face Crystal Palace at Anfield.

NBE executive director removed over violation of rules,"Bipin Batra (photo taken from Twitter account) Bipin Batra (photo taken from Twitter account)

The National Board of Examinations (NBE), regulatory body for postgraduate medical education, has removed its executive director Bipin Batra for allegedly occupying the post in violation of rules. The move comes in the wake of allegations of irregularities, lack of transparency and malfunctioning of the NBE administration, with the latest being charges of malpractices in the conduct of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

The autonomous body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in a meeting here yesterday, also ordered an inquiry into various charges of irregularities against Batra. “Bipin Batra shall cease to discharge the functions of executive director, NBE, with immediate effect,” said a draft resolution adopted by the board.

It also said Rashmikant Dave, vice president, NBE has been appointed honorary executive director till a regular appointment is made to the post in compliance with rules. NBE president Abhijat Sheth confirmed the developments.

Batra had been officiating as the executive director of the board without an approval by the central government, the resolution said, adding that “it is apparent that there is no regularly appointed executive director, NBE in place”.

The present board was nominated on June 20, 2016, and ever since many allegations have plagued the body. The NBE president, on behalf of the board, has apprised the central government and the administration on multiple occasions regarding the various alleged misdeeds that have come to light.

“As such, for the purposes of conducting an expeditious and independent enquiry into all facts and allegations that have come to light, it is resolved to suspend Bipin Batra from all posts being held by him in NBE in any capacity whatsoever until further orders,” the resolution said.

The board has also resolved to appoint Kirtiman Singh as the standing counsel for NBE as an interim arrangement, thus ceasing services of all other advocates/standing counsels who currently represent it. The National Board of Examinations was established in 1975 with the objective of improving the quality of medical education and establishing standards of post graduate examinations in modern medicine on an all-India basis.

Last year, the governing body of the NBE was reconstituted by the government and asked to examine the problems restricting the expansion of postgraduate medicaleducation in the country.

"More potent, safer Zika vaccine developed","Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image) Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image)

Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine that may be more effective, safer and cheaper than other vaccines against the mosquito-borne virus. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to combat Zika, researchers said. The vaccine developed by researchers from Arizona State University (ASU) in the US works against a part of a Zika viral protein, called DIII, that plays a key role for the virus to infect people.

“All flaviviruses have the envelope protein on the outside part of the virus. It has three domains,” said Qiang Chen, a scientist at ASU.

“The domain III has a unique stretch of DNA for the Zika virus, and we exploited this to generate a robust and protective immune response that is unique for Zika,” said Chen, who led the research published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The researchers first grew the envelope protein in bacteria, then prepared the DIII protein domain in tobacco plants.

The team then performed immunisation experiments in mice, which induced antibody and cellular immune responses that have been shown to confer 100 per cent protection against multiple Zika virus strains in mice. The team’s protein-based vaccine uses the smallest and most unique part of the Zika virus that can still elicit a potent and robust immune response.

“In our approach, we make what we call a pseudovirus. It is a fake virus. The pseudovirus displays only the DIII part of the envelope protein on the surface,” said Chen.

“We did a test to make sure that the vaccine produces a potent protective immune response, but also, that it does not produce antibodies that may be cross reactive for dengue, West Nile, yellow fever or others,” he said.

The worldwide Zika threat first emerged in 2015, infecting millions as it swept across the Americas. It struck great fear in pregnant women, as babies born with severe brain birth defects quickly overburdened hospitals and public health care systems.

"Charlottesville crash suspect’s ex-teacher says he idolised Hitler, Nazism","This photo provided by the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail shows James Alex Fields Jr., who was charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say he rammed his car into a crowd of protesters Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Va., where a white supremacist rally took place.

(Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail via AP)

The young man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally was fascinated with Nazism, idolised Adolf Hitler, and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race, a former high school teacher said Monday. James Alex Fields Jr. also confided that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, Derek Weimer said in an interview with The Associated Press.

In high school, Fields was an “average” student, but with a keen interest in military history, Hitler, and Nazi Germany, said Weimer, who said he was Fields’ social studies teacher at Randall K Cooper high school in Union, Kentucky, in Fields’ junior and senior years. “Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy towards Nazism, that idolisation of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy,” Weimer said. “It would start to creep out.”

Police charged Fields with second-degree murder and other counts for allegedly driving his silver Dodge Challenger through a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, killing a 32-year-old woman and wounding at least 19 other people. A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large-scale police response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town and both troopers on board died.

The 20-year-old Fields had been photographed hours earlier carrying the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that organized the “take America back” campaign in protest of the removal of a Confederate statue. The group today denied any association with the suspect, even as a separate hate group that organised Saturday’s rally pledged on social media to organise future events that would be “bigger than Charlottesville.”

The mayor of Charlottesville, political leaders of all political stripes, and activists and community organizers around the country planned rallies, vigils and education campaigns to combat the hate groups. They also urged President Donald Trump to forcefully denounce the organisations, some of which specifically cited Trump’s election after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric as validation of their beliefs.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities would pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash. Weimer recalled that school officials had singled out Fields when he was in 9th grade for his political beliefs and “deeply held, radical” convictions on race and Nazism. “It was a known issue,” he said.

Weimer said Fields left school for a while, and when he came back he was quieter about politics until his senior year, when politicians started to declare their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race. Weimer said Fields was a big Trump supporter because of what he believed to be Trump’s views on race. Trump’s proposal to build a border wall with Mexico was particularly appealing to Fields, Weimer said.

India welcomes US move to designate Hizbul Mujahideen as foreign terror organisation,"Syed Salahuddin, Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, speaks at a news conference in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan July 1, 2017. REUTERS Syed Salahuddin, Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, speaks at a news conference in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan July 1, 2017. REUTERS

India on Thursday welcomed the US decision to designate Kashmiri militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, saying the move was “long overdue”. The US on Wednesday designated the Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist group, nearly two months after declaring its Pakistan-based chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. The decision to designate Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist organisation was long overdue, a Home Ministry spokesperson said, adding “it is well deserved”.

The decision, which slaps a series of US sanctions on the outfit, came against the backdrop of an upsurge in the activities of the militant group in Kashmir in recent months. Among other consequences, all of Hizbul Mujahideen’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.

The US decision marks a severe blow to Pakistan which has been projecting the militant group as a voice of Kashmiri people. Formed in 1989, Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. It has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

The State Department said terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of US agencies and other governments, it said.

"Over the weekend, revival of rains expected in Maharashtra","Light rain brings relief to the city. Rajesh Stephen Light rain brings relief to the city. Rajesh Stephen

After nearly a fortnight-long break this month, weather experts hinted at a revival of rains over the state. While Pune district had managed to be on the excess side on rainfall charts, it still remains 40 per cent surplus in rainfall along with just one district in Maharashtra — Nashik — which topped the state with 41 per cent higher rainfall than normal. However, weather experts said, rainfall surplus over Pune city is fast shrinking with the city recording 408.6 mm rainfall for the season, which is 18 mm surplus than normal for this time of the year.

Despite carrying out multiple water discharge activities on some occasions during late July and early August, most dams supplying water to Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad still possess sufficient water stock. While Pawana and Panshet maintained full capacities, water stock has slightly dipped in Khadakwasla and Warasgaon.

Meanwhile, Vidarbha and Marathwada sub-divisions are facing severe rainfall deficiency. Districts such as Parbhani (-45%), Amravati (-42%), Aurangabad (-38%) have received very little rainfall during this season. But, officials at the India Meteorology Department (IMD), Pune, categorically hinted at isolated heavy rains towards the end of this week over Konkan and Vidarbha regions. Parts of Marathwada and Madhya Maharashtra, too, are expected to experience widespread rainfall over the weekend, added officials.

“Currently, the models are indicating that there is a low pressure system to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal. Under the influence of this system, which is likely to move towards westwards, there would be heightened rainfall activity during August 18-20 over Maharashtra. Some isolated heavy spells are expected over south Konkan and Goa, along with eastern parts of Vidarbha on August 18,” said Sunitha Devi, senior scientist at Climate Monitoring and Analysis group at IMD, Pune.

In the remaining two weeks of this month, she said, there would be rainfall activity throughout, though a strong revival of the monsoon system has been ruled out. “There would be rains all of this month for western regions, especially Maharashtra, with a break of a day or two,” she added.

India beat Austria 4-3 to end European tour on a high,"Ramandeep Singh scored one goal for India. (Source: AP) Ramandeep Singh scored one goal for India. (Source: AP)

Ramandeep Singh and Chinglensana Singh Kangujam struck twice to guide the Indian men’s hockey team to a sensational 4-3 win over Austria in their final encounter of the Europe Tour here.

Double goals from Ramandeep (25th minute, 32nd) and Chinglensana (37th, 60th) helped India end the tour with three wins and two loses.

For Austria, Oliver Binder (14th), Michael Korper (53rd) and Patrick Schmidt (55th) sounded the board.

After two successive wins against World No.4 The Netherlands, India made a steady start against Austria. While they kept most of the ball possession, penetrating into the striking circle was hard to come by.

In fact, it was Austria who took an early lead through Oliver Binder’s goal in the 14th minute to end the first quarter 1-0.

India, however, made amends in the second quarter when they won a PC in the 25th minute. A clever variation saw comeback-man Amit Rohidas pass the ball to Ramandeep Singh who deflected the ball into the circle to equalise the scores.

The 10-minute halftime break saw India comeback into the game as a stronger team with better attack. They made better circle penetrations and a brilliant breakthrough came in when Ramandeep scored a rollicking field goal in the 32nd minute.

It was a reverse hit from the top of circle which flew past the Austrian goalkeeper to give India a 2-1 lead. India found another chance to score when Mandeep Singh helped win a PC through a stick check.

But the opportunity went amiss with the ball hitting the cross bar. However, another opportunity created by Mandeep was successfully converted by Vice Captain Chinglensana in the 37th minute through a superb variation by drag-flicker Varun Kumar.

Going into the final 15 minutes, India had a comfortable 3-1 lead. But a determined Austria put one past the India goalkeeper when they won a PC and Michael Korper converted it successfully in the 53rd minute to set up a close finish.

Though India had won a PC only minutes before, thanks to forward Gurjant Singh, injector Manpreet Singh sent the ball slightly wide.

With a little over eight minutes left, forward Lalit Upadhyay found a great opportunity to score but his strike was brilliantly saved by the Austrian goalkeeper.

Austria then pushed India on the back foot when they scored in the 55th minute via Patrick Schmidt to equalise 3-3.

It was a tense final few minutes with India pushing hard for a goal. With just 10 seconds left for the final hooter, Chinglensana scored a sensational goal when Ramandeep made a brilliant circle penetration to find Gurjant Singh.

A cross hit by Gurjant saw Chinglensana deflect the ball into the goal and seal the match with winning points.

India will return from the Europe Tour tomorrow.

Cristiano Ronaldo five-game ban upheld by Spanish FA,"Cristiano Ronaldo was banned for five games on Monday after shoving a referee following his red card. (Source: AP) Cristiano Ronaldo was banned for five games on Monday after shoving a referee following his red card. (Source: AP)

Cristiano Ronaldo’s five-game ban has been upheld after Real Madrid’s appeal to overturn it failed, according to multiple reports.

The Portugal captain was out of Spanish Super Cup second leg after he was booked twice in El Clasico at Camp Nou, where they defeated rivals Barcelona 3-1. He was then charged a further four match ban for shoving referee De Burgos Bengoetxea for booking him.

According to an ESPN report, the Royal Spanish Football Federation upheld Ronaldo’s five-game ban after he was sent off in the first leg at the Camp Nou. Other than the Spanish Super Cup second leg, he will also miss the first four matches of the La Liga.

The forward came as a substitute in the second half to score the second goal for Los Blancos after Gerard Pique’s own goal and an equaliser by Lionel Messi. Ronaldo, however, got booked for taking off his shirt during the celebration.

An apparent dive saw Ronaldo being awarded with a second yellow. Ronaldo, expecting a penalty, appeared to shove the referee in disbelief and disagreement for his decision. Even though the referee did not react at the time, the 32-year old’s behaviour was included in the official’s report. “After being shown the red card, the player pushed me gently to show his dissent,” De Burgos wrote in the document that covers all the incidents that occurred in the match.

Madrid will play their first match on Sunday at Deportivo La Coruna.

"Monsoon watch: After June and July showers, a dry August","A file photo of a labourer in a dry field at Jandusinga, Jalandhar. The country received 25.6% less area-weighted rainfall during August 1-16 than normal. Express photo A file photo of a labourer in a dry field at Jandusinga, Jalandhar. The country received 25.6% less area-weighted rainfall during August 1-16 than normal. Express photo

The current month is turning out to be the driest August in eight years. The country as a whole has received 25.6 per cent less area-weighted rainfall during August 1-16 than the historical long-period average (normal) for this period. The last time August recorded comparable levels of rain deficiency was in 2009.

The consolation this time, though, is the surplus showers during June and July. It has resulted in the cumulative rainfall for the four-month southwest monsoon season (June-September) being only 4.3 per cent below normal till August 16.

June and July coincides with peak kharif sowing activity. The Agriculture Ministry’s data shows overall plantings this season to have been 0.7 per cent higher than last year, which, of course, saw bumper production. Acreages have gone up in most crops, barring arhar (pigeon-pea), moong (green gram), maize, jowar (sorghum) and major oilseeds (groundnut, soyabean, sesamum and sunflower).

While rains in June and July are important for farmers to take up sowing, there are no less required in August when the crop is in the vegetative growth stage. Moisture stress during this period can have a bearing on yields. The extended dry phase now being witnessed can be cause for worry. The next one week or so would be crucial. The Met Department has forecast a cyclonic formation developing over the northwest Bay of Bengal, which should hopefully lead to a revival of rainfall activity over central India.

In June-July, the main source of concern was the Deep South belt covering southern and coastal Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. These tracts had faced drought or near-drought conditions last year and seemed set for a repeat, a la Maharashtra in 2014 and 2015.

But the dry patch since then has extended also to northern Karnataka, Marathwada, Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Telangana. The crops that can take a hit include maize, soyabean, arhar, urad, jowar and even milk (Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are major producers).

The fact that this has happened even as Gujarat and Rajasthan have suffered excess rains — leading to flooding of fields where farmers had already planted cotton, groundnut or bajra (pearl-millet) – makes for a confused picture.

As things stand, it doesn’t look this year’s kharif crop would be as bumper as it was last time. Nor has the monsoon been as good and well-distributed — at least so far.

When Huma Qureshi gave us style inspiration in a beautiful plaid dress,"Huma Qureshi in a Vidhi Wadhwani creation. (Source: Instagram/iamhumaq) Huma Qureshi in a Vidhi Wadhwani creation. (Source: Instagram/iamhumaq)

Huma Qureshi might not always be a hot favourite of fashion enthusiasts, but this talented is actor is known for cutting a fine figure from time to time. We remember a few memorable looks where she looked drop-dead gorgeous. Our favourite is of the actor in a bright, cheery cold-shoulder yellow dress from Asos which she wore with a pair of fuschia pink earrings from Crimson. She also made quite an impact in a hi-low sleeveless dress and a light lemon yellow floor-length jacket from Ritika Mirchandani.

Now, the actor is back to make your hearts skip a beat in a lovely plaid number during the promotion of her upcoming film Partition 1947. Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra picked up this asymmetrical dress from Vidhi Wadhwani and we are glad she did.

The off-shoulder bow sleeves with the soft sweetheart neckline gives it a feminine touch and the sharp silhouette gives it a nice edge. We like how she styled it with clear strap heels from Intoto, even though we would have preferred a plain black strappy pair.

The sideswept hairdo by celebrity hairstylist Sana Pathan looks gorgeous on Qureshi and her make-up by celebrity make-up artist Ajay Vishwasrao gives her ta beautiful glow. She looks lovely, won’t you agree?

There’s another outfit which we like a lot and we think the Jolly LLB 2 actor looks really elegant in it. The simple black maxi isn’t anything extraordinary but paired with the patterned blue longlayered cape, it looks wonderful on her.

Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra who styled her picked it up from Ritu Kumar and accessorised it well with Amrapali Jewels and Aquamarine Jewellery. Poker straight hair, smokey eyes, and a soft pink pout accentuates her beauty.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

Bacca returns to a Spanish league where the 30-year-old forward flourished in two seasons at Sevilla before joining Milan in 2015. Bacca has made 39 appearances for Colombia, scoring 13 goals. According to Villarreal, he has scored 165 career goals in 336 matches. He scored 14 goals for Milan last season.

Elsewhere in Spain, Las Palmas announced that Kevin-Prince Boateng was leaving the club after both sides agreed to end his contract two days before its season opener.

Las Palmas said that Boateng was leaving due to “personal reasons of an irreversible nature.” The club thanked the former AC Milan standout for his “professionalism” that he displayed during his single season on the Canary Islands.

Las Palmas opens the Spanish league season on Friday at Valencia.

Puneri Paltan captain shares his ‘roller-coaster ride’,"Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team captain Deepak Hooda Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team captain Deepak Hooda

FROM BEING a part-time teacher in his village in Haryana to donning the cap of the captain of Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team, Deepak Hooda said his life has been a “roller coaster ride”.

His tryst with kabaddi began when he was 16 years old and had started participating in local tournaments. Initially, he played to earn money and support his sister after they lost their parents at a very young age.

It was while playing for local tournaments that he developed an interest in kabaddi and aspired to be a part of the national team. “I joined the Haryana team and bagged gold at the senior national-level tournament in Patna in 2014. Later, I played for the national team at the 2016 South Asian Games and won the gold, again. The beginning of the Pro-Kabaddi League brought a huge change in the field. Kabaddi players started getting exposure, financial stability and, more importantly, respect. The reason I am being recognised today by fans, is the Pro-Kabaddi League,” he said.

Hooda added that it was his dream to be a part of the national squad and win laurels. “I was thrilled to be a part of the gold-winning team at the 2016 South Asian Games. My biggest achievement, till date, is being a part of the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup Squad. I hope that, as the captain of the Puneri Paltan, I would be able to lead my team to victory and add another feather to my cap,” he said.

“The feeling of donning the Indian Jersey was a dream come true for me…,” he added.

Pointing out that while cricket is the most popular sport in the country, he said kabaddi was not far behind. According to studies, Kabaddi was the second most viewed sports in India in 2016, he added.

The Pro-Kabaddi League has repackaged the sport in an appealing way, said Hooda, adding that, today, the audience for kabaddi is double as compared to the previous seasons.

“The Pro-Kabaddi League has given a financial stability to players like me, who hail from humble backgrounds. It has given us a platform to showcase our talent. Our team owner’s motive is to promote kabaddi right from the grassroots levels. The government, too, is actively encouraging the sport and its players, and soon enough we may also be a part of the Olympics,” he added.

Pointing out at the void he feels as his parents are not around, he said, “I had lost my mother when I was 4, and my father passed away in 2013, leaving me as the sole breadwinner in the family. Hence, I had to leave my studies. I became a part-time teacher for two years, to support my sister. That was the time I started playing kabaddi and was drawn towards it. Kabaddi helped me a lot, in channelising my energy and emotions for good.”

Blow for Crystal Palace as Wilfried Zaha ruled out for four weeks,"Crystal Palace will be without the services of key player Wilfried Zaha for the next month. (Source: Reuters) Crystal Palace will be without the services of key player Wilfried Zaha for the next month. (Source: Reuters)

Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has been ruled out for four weeks after injuring his right knee in his team’s 3-0 home defeat by promoted Huddersfield Town in their opening Premier League game of the season on Saturday.

The Ivory Coast international, who has been Palace’s Player of the Year for the last two seasons and signed a new five-year deal in May, left Selhurst Park with his knee in a brace and his absence is a major setback for manager Frank de Boer.

British media reported that Zaha, who played the full 90 minutes, is likely to be out until after the upcoming international break and would miss Saturday’s league trip to Liverpool and the home game against Swansea City on Aug. 26.

The 24-year-old would also miss a League Cup fixture against Ipswich Town on Aug. 22 and Ivory Coast’s home and away World Cup qualifiers against Gabon on Sept. 2 and Sept. 5, the reports said.

Palace battled relegation all of last season, only narrowly avoiding the drop under then manager Sam Allardyce. The shock defeat by Huddersfield leaves them second-bottom in the table, above only West Ham United, after the opening round of fixtures.

Katrina Kaif is unarguably one of the fittest actors in the Indian film industry these days. The Bollywood beauty has on and off laid a lot of importance on the concept of staying fit and healthy, and clearly the result shows. The 34-year-old is always particular with her workout sessions and has often shared videos with celebrity trainer and Pilates master Yasmin Karachiwala.

The most recent was Kaif and Karachiwala trying out some combination Pilates moves under strict instructions from well-known master trainer Ann Toran from New York. The short video shows the Jagga Jasoos actor focusing on breathing and stretches while doing exercises that would not only strengthen the core but also tone the arms, calves and thighs.

As many know, Pilates is inspired by calisthenics, yoga and ballet, and is really helpful in increasing flexibility, and improving muscle tone-ups, especially in the abdomen region, lower back, hips and buttocks.

In this video, Kaif is working out on a Pilates reformer, which creates a unique environment for doing varied exercises in a small space. She starts off with simple pull ups for her abdomen, arms and back muscles, moving on to arm exercises and then a combination move for the upper body yet again. If you pay attention, you will find Toran concentrating on breath regulation.

Watch Kaif’s video here.

This is not the first time Kaif has posted on Instagram from her fitness sessions. See her other posts here.

It is not just Kaif, but actors like Alia Bhatt, Kriti Sanon and Sunny Leone are also popularly known for their intense fitness regimes of which Pilates forms a significant constituent.

China announces $1 million aid for flood-hit Nepal,"Vice-Premier Wang started his day with the opening of the construction of the erstwhile royal palace under China’s technical and financial support two years after it was destroyed in the earthquake. Vice-Premier Wang started his day with the opening of the construction of the erstwhile royal palace under China’s technical and financial support two years after it was destroyed in the earthquake.

Related News China Vice Premier Wang Yang in Nepal, Doklam on agenda

AS NEPAL faces its worst floods in the past three decades, with the death toll on Tuesday rising to more than 115, China’s visiting Premier Wang Yang announced a $1 million package for “instant relief” to the victims and formalised agreements worth multi-billion Rupees that are likely to have a significant implication in the bilateral relations.

Nepal and China signed three different agreements — a Rs 2-billion project for joint exploration of petroleum, natural gas and mines; Rs 15-billion project for upgradation of Arniko highway built in the 60s that remains dysfunctional following 2015 April earthquake; and for building a bridge along the Kerung-Rasuwagarhi road, currently under construction. The two sides also agreed to invite more Chinese investment in Nepal.

China’s support to the flood victims comes even before the Nepalese government has been able to make preliminary estimates about the loss of life and property as the ravage continues.

Vice-Premier Wang started his day with the opening of the construction of the erstwhile royal palace under China’s technical and financial support two years after it was destroyed in the earthquake. He also had a series of meetings with K P Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, both former PMs and the chiefs of Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist and Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre, and Bijay Gachedar and KB Mahara, both deputy prime ministers.

After mass failures in Board exams: Vishwas group now for Class IX students; they can drop subjects,"According to the government, this change has been made after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) allowed Class IX in the patrachar (private) mode. According to the government, this change has been made after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) allowed Class IX in the patrachar (private) mode.

With A large number of private candidates — who were under Vishwas group in Delhi government schools — having failed the Class X boards this year, the group has now been created for Class IX.

Under the “Chunauti” scheme — a project to improve learning levels in the children — students of Delhi government schools, between Classes VI and IX, are divided into groups depending on their reading and writing ability. The ones who can read are Pratibha, the non-readers are Nistha. Vishwas group, on the other hand, had students who had failed twice in Class IX, and also out of school students.

According to the government, this change has been made after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) allowed Class IX in the patrachar (private) mode.

“This year, CBSE has extended the Class IX in correspondence mode. The students will be coming to schools to attend regular classes. Just under the correspondence mode, the board gives the option of either dropping science or mathematics,” said Atishi Marlena, adviser to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

As reported by The Indian Express earlier, out of the total 64,000, about 60,000 students had failed. Among those who had failed, 5,918 students had passed in three main subjects, while 5,034 students had failed to clear science.

5,034 students failed science; pvt candidates, part of Vishwas group, struggle most with science subjects Also Read

Under the patrachar mode, studying social sciences is compulsory. However, a student can choose between two languages and two subjects from science, home science and mathematics.

However, principals say that in most schools, not many students are under the Vishwas group at present. “The students are promoted till Class VIII, so it is difficult to put any student under the group. Last year, the group mostly comprised of students who had failed in Class IX twice,” said AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector 8.

In Delhi government schools, every year, large number of students fail in Class IX. In 2016-17 out of the 2,44,636 who had appeared in the examination in 1,100 schools, only 12,7,904 students had passed. This year, however, along with this change, the Nistha group is further divided into Nistha and neo-Nistha. Nistha are the non-readers, and neo-Nistha are the absolute beginners who can barely recognise alphabets and numbers.

White House braces for fallout from Trump remarks on Virginia violence,"White House chief of staff John Kelly, left, watches as President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017 in Washington.

U.S. President Donald Trump no doubt pleased part of his political base on Tuesday by passionately arguing that both right and left-wing extremists were responsible for violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia on Saturday. But his remarks, one day after he, under pressure, explicitly condemned neo Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, left White House officials bracing for fallout from disappointed Republicans whose support he needs to govern in the coming months and years.

“Your base isn’t going to win you re-election … nor is it going to keep you a majority in Congress,” said one administration official. It was political reality that the controversy over Trump’s response would last for some time, he said. The remarks at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday that sparked that reality at times bordered on the surreal.

Trump pulled out the statement he read on Saturday in an apparent effort to show, despite the subsequent criticism, that his initial instincts that “many sides” had been at fault were correct.

“What about the alt-left that came charging at the … alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?” he demanded, using terms that refer to right- and left-wing extremists.

He lashed out at the news media, a frequent foil, for its reporting about his reaction to the violence.

And he praised Susan Bro, the mother of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who died after a car driven by a man reported to have harbored Nazi sympathies ploughed into the rally opponents.

The praise, however, was for her warm remarks about Trump.

“Under the kind of stress that she’s under and the heartache that she’s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something,” the president said.

Trump’s political supporters embrace his style, and the Tuesday back-and-forth with reporters was an example of a characteristic that defines him, said a former adviser: a dislike for being criticized or pressured.

“When you push the president to do something, he’s not going to do it. He’s going to make a point not to do it,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide.

White House officials said time would tell how long the issue would remain in the headlines, and whether it would hurt Trump badly with legislators and others within his political base.

For now, the administration official said, the best strategy to deal with the fallout was to stay mum. “Let’s just put a pin in it, and you know, not tweet, not comment any further,” he said. “Right now explaining is losing.”

Virat Kohli-led Indian team arrives in Dambulla for first ODI against Sri Lanka; see pics,"India will play their first ODI on Sunday in Dambulla. (Source: Twitter) India will play their first ODI on Sunday in Dambulla. (Source: Twitter)

After registering a thumping 3-0 Test series win over hosts Sri Lanka, it’s time to gear up for the five match ODI series, which will start on August 20 in Dambulla. As Team India arrived in Dambulla on Thursday for their first ODI, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a few pictures from their official Twitter handle of the Indian players, stepping out of the bus and being greeted by the locals.

The BCCI tweeted,”#TeamIndia members arrive for the 1st ODI vs. @OfficialSLC at Dambulla #SLvIND.”

Team India are all set to give a tough fight to Sri Lanka as they have a solid batting line-up with the likes of Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, which is enough to destroy any bowling attack in the world. The inexperience in the Sri Lankan camp can make it more difficult for the hosts to put up a challenging fight in the series.

Sri Lanka will be banking on their experienced lot including Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga and Thisara Perera. Also, Niroshan Dickwella’s impressive form with the bat is a good sign for the team. Lasith Malinga will be leading the Lankan bowling attack and he can prove to be really effective on his day.

India on the other hand, would be relying on their batting power and apart from that the fast bowling options with the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Hardik Pandya will play a huge role in shaping up the Indian bowling unit during the entire series.

"Over a dozen opposition parties join hands to fight BJP, preserve ‘composite culture’","Congress-Vice President Rahul Gandhi. (file photo) Congress-Vice President Rahul Gandhi. (file photo)

More than a dozen opposition parties joined hands today to call for a united fight against the BJP with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi taking the government head on and accusing it of not fulfilling its promises. The platform for opposition unity was the ‘Sanjhi Virasat Bachao’ (save our composite culture) meeting hosted by rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and attended by a host of leaders, including those from the Congress, CPI-M, CPI, SP, BSP, NCP, RJD, NC, JD-S and RLD.

Addressing the gathering, which included former prime minister Manmohan Singh as well as the CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja and National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, Gandhi said they backed an India that stood for the truth. “Modi ji says he wants to create a ‘Swachch Bharat’ but we want a ‘Sach Bharat’,” Gandhi said, but did not elaborate further.

He also stressed on the need for unity in the fight against the BJP and the RSS. “If we all fight unitedly, I can tell you they will not be seen anywhere,” he said.

Sharad Yadav, who has parted ways with his old-time colleague, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, amid speculation that the JD-U would split, echoed him. If people united, “even a Hitler” cannot stand before them, said Yadav, who appeared to emerge as a rallying point for the opposition with leaders collectively endorsing his call for preserving India’s composite culture.

Gandhi also accused the BJP of not fulfilling the promises made to the people during the 2014 general elections, including bringing back black money stashed abroad and creating jobs for youth. Alleging that the RSS knew that its views would not help them win elections, he said it was trying to plant its people in every institution.

“Till the time RSS did not rule India, they never saluted the national flag… You can look at this nation in two ways. One says this country is mine, other says I belong to the country. That’s the difference between RSS and us,” he said.

Referring to the theme of the meeting, CPI(M) general secretary Yechury said several Hindu and Muslims leaders fought against the British but “this composite heritage is being threatened now”. Calling for a joint fight against “divisive and communal” forces, he said more Muslims chose to stay back in India than go to Pakistan after partition. But this composite culture is now being tampered with to convert India into a “Hindu Rashtra”, Yechury alleged.

Yechury said Yadav held the key to saving India’s syncretic culture. “We are with Sharad Yadav. If we have to save this composite culture, Sharad ji will hold the key to the movement to save it. He will have to complete the task,” he said.

“The prime minister talks about not repeating Indira Gandhi’s Emergency. But what is he doing?” he asked, while noting that Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar’s recorded Independence Day speech was blocked by public broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio. “We will fight against the policies destroying diversity,” Yechury added.

Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat, also backed Yadav. “I urge Sharad ji to prepare an action plan… We will go to every nook and corner of the country and warn people that we will not be able to save the country, democracy, humanity if we do not save our composite culture, heritage. “We require this to defeat these forces in 2019. All of you will need to cooperate on this issue,” he said.

Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Yadav was the “real JD-U” and noted that he had declined a cabinet berth and chosen the path of secularism. CPI’s Raja dubbed the RSS an “unconstitutional” authority and alleged it was instructing the government in every matter. “They are trying to destroy our composite culture by dividing the people. They want to win elections in any manner.”

National Conference leader Abdullah also launched a scathing attack on the state of affairs in the country but did not name anybody. “India can face China and Pakistan but unfortunately today the threat is from inside not from outside.”

“Andar koi chor baitha hua hai jo hamara beda garak kar raha hai (There is a thief sitting inside who is determined to spoil everything),” Abdullah added in an apparent broadside against the Centre.

Reacting to the meeting, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was “hypocrisy” to talk about composite heritage and remain silent on the killing of RSS workers in Kerala allegedly by CPI(M) goons. “To this talk of composite heritage which is going on today, I have a question. The RSS workers in Kerala’s Kannur who are being allegedly killed by CPI(M) workers, which heritage is that,” he asked.

India A collapse meekly to lose unofficial Test to South Africa A,"Junior Dala picked up five wickets in the second innings against India A in the unofficial Test. (Source: Cricket South Africa) Junior Dala picked up five wickets in the second innings against India A in the unofficial Test. (Source: Cricket South Africa)

India A came into the fourth and final day of their first unofficial Test against South Africa A in Pretoria with their backs against the wall. The visitors were 192/6 and chasing a massive target of 447 runs. The equation firmly hinged in South Africa A’s favour with India A needing 255 runs more and the home side needing four wickets with the Karun Nair-captained side once again collapsing to a heap. The race to the finish line was completed in just 25 overs as Junior Dala picked up four quick wickets to finish with a fifer and give South Africa A a 235 run win. The seamer needed just 10.1 overs to pick up 5/36 as India A batting once again disintegrated.

South Africa A opening batsman Stephen Cook was named the Man of the Match for 120 run knock in the first innings that helped set up the win for the hosts. He added 32 runs to his tally in the second innings.

“We made it our mission to start the series off with a win, that was the big focus for the team and personal accolades should come after that,” Cook said to Cricket South Africa. “Obviously to contribute and to get some runs in a winning cause is always good and it’s always good to get the series off to a winning start.”

“We know that the A side and even the Proteas’ time in England didn’t go too well, so it’s good to start our home summer on the front foot so we can build on to this momentum.”

“We had a good team performance all the way around,” he continued. “I may have gotten the man of the match award but there were a number of performances that contributed. Junior Dala this morning bowled with good pace and got the ball to reverse swing a bit and did what fast bowlers should do, which is to wrap up the tail, credit to him and credit to everyone. I mean, someone like Dane Piedt who maybe didn’t get the wickets in the second innings, put some good pressure and bowled well into the rough.”

India A had lost Ankit Bawne just before stumps on the third day and the tail couldn’t hold much resistance on the fourth day. Shahbaz Nadeem fell for 28 runs in the first dismissal of the day. Aniket Choudhary and Mohammed Siraj followed soon thereafter. India A were already without the retired Vijay Shankar.

The second and last unofficial Test in the series begins on August 19 in Potchefstroom, Pretoria.

BRIEF SCORES: South Africa A: 346 & 220 defeat India A: 120 & 211 (Ankit Bawne 46, Ishan Kishan 39; Junior Dala 5/36) by 235 runs.

Japan’s Vissel Kobe sack manager Nelsinho,"Vissel Kobe were seventh in the standings last year. (Source: File) Vissel Kobe were seventh in the standings last year. (Source: File)

Vissel Kobe have sacked manager Nelsinho, with head coach Takayuki Yoshida replacing the Brazilian on an interim basis, the Japanese top-flight club said on Wednesday.

Kobe have struggled this season and are currently 11th in the 18-team J.League, despite having former Germany forward Lukas Podolski in their squad. Nelsinho’s fate was sealed after Kobe slumped to a third consecutive loss with a 1-0 defeat by FC Tokyo on Sunday.

“Unfortunately, I couldn’t achieve what we were aiming for, but I was able to see the team grow a lot toward earning a title in football,” Nelsinho said in a statement.

“As a professional, I feel greatly responsible for not being able to live up to everyone’s expectations.” The 67-year-old took charge of Kobe in 2015 and guided them to a 12th-place finish in his first year. Kobe were seventh in the standings last year.

Interim manager Yoshida called for unity from the squad. “I have no experience as manager, so I told the players that we should work together as one,” the 40-year-old was quoted as saying by Kyodo News Agency.

Yoshida’s first game in charge is a home fixture against third-placed Yokohama F Marinos on Sunday.

Tottenham Hotspur out to conquer their Wembley hoodoo,"In 10 games over 10 years since Wembley reopened, Tottenham have won just twice there. (Source: Reuters) In 10 games over 10 years since Wembley reopened, Tottenham have won just twice there. (Source: Reuters)

Many years after Tottenham Hotspur fans sang their famous cup anthem about Ossie Ardiles’s knees going all tremble on his way to Wembley, they hope their side overcome similar nerves as the stadium becomes their new home this weekend.

On Sunday Spurs begin a season playing at England’s national stadium while their White Hart Lane ground is redeveloped.

Waiting for Mauricio Pochettino’s stylish side will be an encouraging wall of noise from 40,000 fans who have season tickets, plus dangerous opponents in Chelsea, who beat them 4-2 there in last season’s FA Cup semi-final.

In 10 games over 10 years since Wembley reopened, Spurs, have won just twice there, and last season lost two of their three home Champions League games which were staged there in preparation for this season’s move.

“We have had a few bad performances in the Champions League — against Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen — but it was like an experience,” said Spurs captain Hugo Lloris this week, predicting that Spurs’ losing Wembley ways “belong in the past”.

“We have also had some great performances there even if the results were not the best, like in the Europa League or against Chelsea in the (FA Cup) semi-final even though we lost,” he told reporters.

With no dispensation to train there from Wembley’s owners, the Football Association, Spurs are practising this week on a specially adapted pitch at their Enfield training complex which replicates the national stadium’s more expensive measurements.

The Wembley pitch is bigger by 545 square metres than the one at White Hart Lane, an eight percent difference.

Over 90 minutes that means the players have to run much further, although Pochettino plays down the problems it will throw up.

“Remember when I first came to Tottenham and I was criticised for saying the White Hart Lane pitch was too small for us?” said the manager. “And now, people are saying that Wembley is too big?”

Three years ago he complained that White Hart Lane’s tightness did not suit his team’s style, but they adjusted well and last season turned it into a fortress with 21 wins and two draws in 23 games there.

Now he believes Spurs will adapt again and two weeks ago beat Juventus 2-0 there with goals from Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen in a pre-season friendly.

“It’s still new for us, it’s our first time here this year and we’re going to have to get used to it fast,” said left back Ben Davies.

For some, talk of a Wembley hoodoo has been overstated, given that most of the games which Spurs lost there were against top-quality opposition on major occasions. League games may be different.

Ardiles is among those hoping so and the Argentine is optimistic about their prospects, starting against a Chelsea side who lost their opening game at home to Burnley.

“New season. New hope. Finished 2nd last season. Can we go one better? Of course we can. We have the players and the manager to do it,” Ardiles posted on Twitter last week.

Round tripping of funds: Sebi slaps Rs 18 crore fine on 22 entities,"After observing certain irregularities pertaining to the IPO of BLL, Sebi had passed an order against the company and its directors back in December 2011. After observing certain irregularities pertaining to the IPO of BLL, Sebi had passed an order against the company and its directors back in December 2011.

Markets regulator Sebi has imposed a total fine of Rs 17.55 crore on 22 entities for round tripping of funds through fictitious transactions and siphoning off proceeds from the initial share sale of Brooks Laboratories Ltd (BLL). In a 38-page order dated August 16, Sebi said the practices adopted by the 22 entities are “serious in nature which have the cascading adverse effect towards the investors/shareholders” and have inflicted a fraud on them.

After observing certain irregularities pertaining to the IPO of BLL, Sebi had passed an order against the company and its directors back in December 2011. Investigations found that certain fraudulent exercises were committed by the promoters of BLL in connivance with other entities resulting in siphoning of funds worth Rs 8 crore. It was also found that BLL’s board had passed certain resolutions to raise funds through short term unsecured loans in the form of Inter Corporate Deposits (ICDs).

According to Sebi, it was observed that the promoters of BLL in connivance with the noticees had indulged in fictitious transactions and round tripping of funds and in the process also siphoned of the funds from the IPO proceeds. Sebi noted that fraudulent practices of siphoning off funds from IPO proceeds, round tripping and creating false liability in the form of ICDs, misutilisation of the proceeds to offset losses suffered by entities in the market and concealment of material information can influence the decision of IPO investors.

“The noticees have acted in a concerted manner in inflicting a fraud on the unsuspecting/gullible investors of BLL who have fallen prey to the fraudulent acts…,” the order said. Sebi has directed the entities to pay the penalty of Rs 17.55 crore within 45 days of receiving the order. In 2015, the Securities Appellate Tribunal had set aside the adjudication order in the matter that was passed in December 2013. The tribunal had directed the adjudicating officer to adjudicate the matter afresh. About Suryamukhi Projects Pvt Ltd, one of the 22 entities, the watchdog said with a malafide and premeditated plan it along with the promoters of BLL had defrauded the IPO investors “by being a significant part in the round tripping of funds and aiding and abetting BLL in such fraudulent activities”.

“Clearly, Suryamukhi’s role in acting as a layer for round tripping of Rs 8 crore in the guise of ICDs and aiding and abetting BLL in such fraudulent activities with ulterior motive of siphoning the IPO proceeds cannot be ignored and the same has been established beyond doubt,” the order said.

Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu set to return home,"Gurpreet Sandhu has parted ways with Stabaek, four months before his contract expires. File Gurpreet Sandhu has parted ways with Stabaek, four months before his contract expires. File

AFTER MANAGING just 10 official matches and spending a meagre 839 minutes on field, India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has decided to pull curtains on his European adventure. Three years after he moved to Norway, Sandhu has parted ways with Eliteserien side Stabaek, four months before his contract expires. Lack of playing time with the Norwegian top division side is the key reason for Sandhu to return to India.

The 25-year-old is all set to join Indian Super League side Bengaluru FC, who will pay upward of Rs 1 crore in salary to avail his services. An official announcement is likely to be made on Thursday. Bengaluru released their 25-man squad for their AFC Cup inter-zonal semifinal against North Korean side April 25 on Wednesday. Although Sandhu does not feature in the list, he is expected to be included once the deal is made official.

Sandhu confirmed the move in an interview to Stabaek’s official website, saying he was ‘sad’ to leave them. Although he did not directly reveal his next destination, he dropped a hint. “I’ll catch a flight tomorrow and head back. The team is supposed to play in a competition next week so I am looking forward to prepare for that and do well over there,” Sandhu told the club website, referring to the first leg of Bengaluru’s semifinal on August 23.

Sandhu joined Stabaek from East Bengal in 2014 on a three-year deal. However, the move didn’t pan out as expected. He spent a major part of his stint playing second fiddle to Ivory Coast international Sayouba Mande. In his first season there, Sandhu made just one appearance — in a Cup match. In his second year, he played only five matches (four Cup and one league) while in 2017, he has only made four appearances for the main team in official matches.

The lack of match time forced Sandhu to reconsider his future in Norway. Flooded with offers from ISL, he was keen to make a move last year but hung on after being assured of more playing time by Stabaek’s goalkeeping coach Espen Granli.

The decision paid off after he was chosen ahead of Mande for the club’s crucial Europa League playoff match against Welsh team Connah’s Quay Nomads FC in June last year. But he was taken off after 30 minutes after suffering an injury.

Since then, it’s been a struggle. Unlike most foreign stints involving Indian players, Sandhu’s move wasn’t a waste of time. Although he did not play many matches, training at Stabaek under Granli ensured his growth was rapid.

When he went to Stabaek, Sandhu was raw and prone to making errors.

However, within a year of training there, his movement, speed and decision-making improved so drastically that from being on the fringes of the national team, he became the country’s No. 1 goalkeeper within a year, displacing Subrata Pal. He was later named the national team captain.

In the process, he also raised the bar for Indian players aspiring to grind it out abroad. Sandhu became the first Indian player to play in a first division match of a European league before becoming the first from the country to feature in a Europa League game.

“My first league start and Europa League game, it’s right up there. I waited for such a long time and to get that opportunity, coming from where I come from, it’s very special. It’s been an incredible journey. I am very sad it’s coming to an end,” Sandhu added.

Served with Love is a typical, I-hate-you-at-first-sight-then fall-in-endless-love story. Set in the kitchen of a plush hotel, the story involves Pakhi, an able sous chef and Abhimanyu Dev, another equally able chief chef — but he’s also a hard taskmaster and the owner of the hotel chain. He’s dated a lot of supermodels but has never committed to anyone. And Pakhi has put her life on hold for her three-year-old orphaned niece.Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway.

Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway. Over ‘vegetable angaara’, ‘home-made rasmalai’ and a recipe of hot chocolate laced with chilli. Kisses are stolen between hospital visits for an ailing grandfather and Abhimanyu caring for Pakhi’s orphaned niece. There’s a dash of jealousy in the form of a psychotic ex-fiance of Pakhi. But it’s never clear what the two protagonists really like in each other except her “ample” assets, and his “ponytail”.

Plot and character development in this book are competitively cringe-making, and it’s difficult to decide which is the winner. It’s easy to see who isn’t — the reader. Read this if only you wish to expand your knowledge of fancy desserts and how a five-star kitchen functions.

"ICMR Report From January onwards, 1,335 cancer cases reported in Chandigarh","CANCER CASES are increasing in Chandigarh, revealed figures given by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). According to a fresh ICMR report, Chandigarh recorded 1,335 new cancer cases till August this year. The report was presented by the Union Ministry of Health during the monsoon session of the Rajya Sabha which concluded last week.

Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dullo had asked several questions, including if “it is a fact that the number of cancer patients is on the rise in the country, particularly in the states of Punjab and Haryana. The health ministry reply stated that as per ICMR’s cancer registry data, there has been an increase in the estimated incidence of cancer in the country, including Punjab and Haryana.

ICMR collects the cancer data of the country under its National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP). Hospital-based cancer registries are functional in various hospitals across the country. In Chandigarh, such registries are located at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and GMCH at Sector 32.

According to another ICMR report, also presented in the Rajya Sabha, the health ministry said the estimated incidence of cancer cases in 2014 in Chandigarh was 1,162, while the numbers were 1,217 and 1,274 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In all the UTs and states, the estimated incidence of cancer cases till August is 15,17,426.

The ICMR report has also provided data of other Union Territories, too. According to that report, Delhi recorded 20,899 cases, Puducherry 1,687, Andaman and Nicobar Islands 443, Lakshadweep 96, Daman and Diu 504 and Dadra and Nagar Haveli 542.

“Increase of cancer is not limited to Chandigarh. It is increasing across the country,” Dr Rakesh Kapoor, Professor, Department of Radiotherapy, PGIMER, who is actively involved in the cancer registries in Chandigarh, told Chandigarh Newsline. He said Chandigarh doesn’t have the highest incidence of cancer and is equivalent to the national average.

A population-based cancer registry (PBCR) report, prepared by Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), Mumbai, and PGI, which was released last year, said Chandigarh’s Sector 38 West and Manimajra recorded the maximum number of cancer cases and deaths in the city in 2013.

PGI doctors said the 2014 report, which is being prepared, would be released in a month.

Last year, an ICMR report had said that the ratio of cancer among boys recorded at PGI’s hospital cancer registry between 2012 and 2014 was 10.2 per cent against the total number of cancer cases, while the ratio was 6.3 per cent among the girls.

"Glenn Maxwell could certainly bowl a lot more in Bangladesh Tour, says Steve Smith","Glenn Maxwell had a successful tour to India. (Source: Reuters) Glenn Maxwell had a successful tour to India. (Source: Reuters)

Australian skipper Steve Smith has urged hard hitting allrounder Glenn Maxwell to continue doing his good to work with the ball. Smith said that if Maxwell can do so then it would provide him with another bowling option in the upcoming tour to Bangladesh.

Speaking to cricket.com.au Smith said “We had Nathan who was bowling the same style and bowling quite well, so I didn’t see a great opportunity for him. But you never know, if he’s bowling pretty well and the off-spinners are doing the damage, he could certainly bowl a lot more. Hopefully, he keeps working on his bowling and the ball is coming out well. That’d give me another option.”

Glenn Maxwell too acknowledged the needs of his captain and hoped to put on a good show. Speaking to the AAP, Maxwell said, “I suppose coming into this tour, I’m hoping that I can show that I’ve put a lot of work into my bowling and I can get that opportunity. I’ve shortened my bowling stride a little bit to make sure that I’ve got that drop on the ball and that I’m getting the shape that I actually want. “It’s obviously one of my skills that I can bring to the side, and something that’s going to help me try and nail down that No.6 position, having that extra string to my bow.”

“It’s obviously one of my skills that I can bring to the side, and something that’s going to help me try and nail down that No.6 position, having that extra string to my bow.”

Meanwhile, bowling coach David Saker had a word of advice for skipper Steve Smith and urged the skipper to bowl himself more often in Tests.

On Love and Desire,"Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha)

Amitava Kumar’s new novel maps the journey of a young man, Kailash, in “Reagan’s America” as he searches for love and meaning in life. Woven within the fabric of a larger political narrative, Kumar calls The Lovers (Aleph Book Company, Rs 599), an “in-between novel” — somewhere between fiction and non-fiction. “It speaks about the current situation, in the sense that it gives immigrants a voice. Not just a voice but a voice on their own terms. My narrator doesn’t simply declare his right to live there, he wants the right to love too,” says Kumar, who recently launched the book in Delhi.

In The Lovers, Kumar says, he has written about love and desire like never before. “I am getting old and I thought the body forgets. Through this book, I wanted to remember who I was. When I went to the US, I always thought that I would come back soon, but time kept passing. So I also thought that I must write about my life in the US, the 30 years that I have been there,” says Kumar, whose previous books include Home Products (2010) and non-fiction works such as Husband of a Fanatic (2004) and Passport Photos (2000), among others.

In the novel, Kailash’s professor and mentor, Ehsaan Ali, plays a pivotal role. Ali’s character was inspired by political scientist and anti-war activist Eqbal Ahmad, who was born in Bihar and moved to Pakistan after Partition. Ahmad studied in the US and ended up teaching there. “I never met him, but he has been an inspiring figure for me, not only because he was born in Bihar but because he embodied a radical cosmopolitanism,” says the Arrah-born author.

In the US and the UK, the book has been published with a different title — Immigrant, Montana. “I think it was David Davidar who chose this title (The Lovers). I like it because my narrator says he tore out a page from a magazine in the library that had Picasso’s The Lovers printed on it. This was the painting that Picasso did after first making love,” says Kumar, 54, who is currently the Helen D. Lockwood Professor of English at Vassar College in New York’s Poughkeepsie.

As a graduate student in the US in the late 1980s, Kumar maintained a journal that has served as inspiration for the novel. “I saved many letters from that time, some of them were written by women, which I was surprised to discover. It also includes some letters by my mother. But reading those letters was depressing — the past coming back at you like that. So I left those. Instead, I used to read the book My Mistress’s Sparrow is Dead, a collection of short stories. I read one story each day and wrote the next day. In other words, I used literature to call back some memories and also imagine other things,” he says.

Liking different brands can make partners unhappy: Study,"If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images) If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

It may not seem like a big deal whether your partner prefers Coke or Pepsi, but scientists suggest that liking different brands can affect our happiness in relationships more than shared interests or personality traits.

“People think compatibility in relationships comes from having similar backgrounds, religion or education,” said Gavan Fitzsimons, a professor at Duke University in the US.

“But we find those things don’t explain how happy you are in life nearly as much as this notion of brand compatibility,” said Fitzsimons.

The researchers found that partners who had low power in their relationships – those who do not feel they can shape their partner’s behaviour – tend to find themselves stuck with their partner’s preferred brands.

“If you are lower in relationship power and have different brand preferences than your partner, you’re probably going to find yourself stuck with your partner’s favourite brands, over and over again. This could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts feeling,” said Danielle Brick, now at the University of New Hampshire.

“Most couples won’t break up over brand incompatibility, but it leads to the low power partner becoming less and less happy,” said Brick.

Studies in several settings produced the same result. The researchers used brand preferences in soda, coffee, chocolate, beer and automobiles to study individuals and couples, some of whom were tracked over two years.

These results were combined with findings on relationship power and happiness.

Brick said it is likely these brand compatibility effects have steadily gained strength as brands have evolved to play a bigger role in the daily lives of consumers.

However, they are not given the same weight as other relationship-influencing factors because they are not seen as significant.

“If you are a different religion than your romantic partner, you know that if this is an issue you can’t work through, then the relationship isn’t going to last,” Brick said.

“Conversely, if you like Coke and your partner likes Pepsi, you’re probably not going to break up over it – but 11 years into a relationship, when he or she keeps coming home with Pepsi, day in and day out, it might start to cause a little conflict,” she said.

“If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy,” she added.

The research was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

NIA arrests Srinagar businessman Zahoor Watali in terror funding case,"CRPF personnel outside one of the residences where the raids were conducted, in Srinagar. (Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) CRPF personnel outside one of the residences where the raids were conducted, in Srinagar. (Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)

The National Investigative Agency on Thursday arrested Srinagar businessman Zahoor Watali in connection with the ongoing terror funding probe. The agency said Watali is suspected of acting as a conduit for illegally remitting funds to secessionists, terrorists, and stone-pelters. Watali was earlier arrested in 1990 by the Jammu & Kashmir Police when some anti-national activists were found present at his house at Srinagar, according to the NIA.

“The searches have unearthed highly incriminating material pertaining to the receipt of funds by Zahoor Watali from foreign sources and its further distribution to terrorists and separatists in Kashmir Valley for anti-India activities,” the NIA said in a statement.

Earlier on Wednesday, the agency raided 12 places in Kashmir, including the homes of two lawyers, two drivers and a government official. One of the advocates, Mohammad Shafi Reshi, who is affiliated to Hurriyat’s S A S Geelani faction, is the uncle of PDP legislator Yasir Reshi.

NIA sleuths and officials said the searches — conducted simultaneously at Sanatnagar, Parimpora, Tarhama and Mazhama in Baramulla, and Machipora and Bakhihaker in Kupwara — have led to documents related to hawala funding.

“A lot of incriminating material, suspect financial records, property-related documents and electronic devices including mobile phones, pen drives and hard drives were seized during the searches,” a senior NIA official had said on Wednesday.

At Gulberg Colony, the NIA searched the house of advocate Mohammad Shafi Reshi. At Tarhama village, the NIA raided two houses — of Peerzada Ghulam Nabi, who is an employee with the industries, and commerce department, and Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, who is an accountant of Watali.

In Kupwara’s Machipora, the home of one of Watali’s employees, Ghulam Mohammad, was also searched. Another search was carried at Bakhihakar village at the house of Abdul Aziz Mir, the caretaker of a property belonging to Watali.

High drama was witnessed at Bhiwani on Tuesday when a dalit MLA from BJP did not find any chair left for him at the stage for Independence Day function. The Bawani Khera MLA, Bishamber Singh Balmiki, immediately left the stage to register his protest.

“Me gual hun aaj bhi, muje bethan nahi gaya seat par (I am still a slave. I was not allowed to sit on the chair),” said the MLA when the officers rushed to request the legislator to return to the stage. “I can resign but won’t sit (on the stage again),” he said.

Bhiwani Deputy Commissioner Anshaj Singh told The Indian Express that they had made proper sitting arrangements for the invitees.

“An SHO was looking after the arrangements. When the MLA came to the stage, the Independence Day function was going on and everybody was busy in the function. Some worker sat on the seat earmarked for the MLA. There

Kumkum Bhagya 17 August 2017 full episode written update: Abhi announces that Purab has married someone,"Kumkum Bhagya 17 August 2017 full episode written update: Abhi says he has planned something special for him and Raj asks if it is some sort of a welcome party Kumkum Bhagya 17 August 2017 full episode written update: Abhi says he has planned something special for him and Raj asks if it is some sort of a welcome party

In the first scene Munni pleads to goddess Durga to send Pragya back and puts the red kumkum from the plate on her forehead and says that she is putting it as a prasad of goddess Durga and this shouldn’t be mistaken for Abhi’s name. She says she must go now as she should see what Abhi is upto.

There Purab calls Abhi from midway where the truck driver has stopped for refreshments, and tells him about Disha and how he married her halfway. Abhi asks him to come over quickly. Sangram Singh on the other hand reaches the hotel where Purab stayed and asks the receptionist for Purab’s address in Mumbai, the receptionist says it’s against their policy but Sangram Singh grabs his collars and pulls him over the desk while his goons ask him to calm down and to not create a scene as this isn’t their area. Sangram Singh leaves him and turns to pull out revolver and points it at the receptionist and asks him again, who then tells him the address.

There at Mehra house Dadi, Dasi, Munni, Mitali, Taaiji and Raj are waiting in the hall as Abhi has called them to talk. Everyone asks each other if anyone has any idea but no one does. Munni thinks it must be about her while Tannu says it shouldn’t be to throw her and Aaliya out of the house. Abhi comes there and Raj asks him why has he called them this early in the morning and Abhi asks them to relax as it’s good news. He then tells them that Purab has married a girl and he is bringing her home.

He says some problem took place in their marriage and so he is bringing the girl home. Everyone is happy, but Aaliya and Tannu get tensed. Munni wonders if she should smile as half of them are happy or she shouldn’t as Aaliya doesn’t seem to be. Abhi says he has planned something special for him and Raj asks if it is some sort of a welcome party. Abhi says he has planned to get them married that same evening as they couldn’t complete the phera ceremony. Tannu holds Aaliya’s hand and she is completely cold. Next we see Aaliya shouting in her room wondering how can Purab marry someone and that she loves him. She asks why is Abhi not able to see that. She says Abhi wants to help the whole world but can’t see his sister.

She says he loves Pragya then why can’t he understand that she loves Purab and can’t let him go. She puts her hand on burning candle and Tannu pulls her and says it could burn her. Aaliya says she is burning inside out and Tannu slaps her. Aaliya calm down and starts crying and pleads to Tannu to stop Purab marrying that girl and get him to marry her while Mitali comes and sees that and pities Aaliya.

Bangladesh ramps up border patrols to deter fresh Rohingya inflow,"Rohingya refugees cross the border into Bangladesh close to Whaikyang in Cox’s Bazar District, Southeastern Bangladesh. (Amnesty International via AP) Rohingya refugees cross the border into Bangladesh close to Whaikyang in Cox’s Bazar District, Southeastern Bangladesh. (Amnesty International via AP)

Bangladesh has stepped up patrols on its border with Myanmar, following reports that about 1,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed into the country in the past two weeks, amid fresh tension in its neighbour’s northwestern Rakhine state. Security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launched a massive crackdown in the state after Rohingya insurgents killed nine police in October, but the flow of refugees into Bangladesh had slowed until hundreds more soldiers were deployed recently. “Security forces are patrolling the villages daily,” said Rahim, a teacher from Dar Gyi Zar village in Myanmar who fled to Bangladesh last year, but remains in touch with family members.

“My mother is 73 and is panicking there, but she won’t be able to flee,” said Rahim, who uses one name, like many Rohingya.

“No one will be allowed to illegally cross into our country,” Manuzurul Hasan Khan, a senior Bangladesh border guard official, told Reuters, adding that the two countries were jointly patrolling frontier areas.

There had been no major influx recently, he said, adding that the border was peaceful, with more joint patrols scheduled for this week. However, Rahim and a Rohingya leader in Bangladesh put the total of new refugees at more than 1,000. There had been a constant “slow movement of people across the border,” a senior U.N. official in Bangladesh said. About 1,000 households had crossed each month in April, May and June, estimated the official, who declined to be identified in the absence of authorisation to talk to the media. The figure rose to 1,300 households in July, the official said, adding that the border area was “definitely seeing more new arrivals” in August.

About 500 of the newly arrived Rohingya live near an unofficial refugee camp in Leda, near the Naf river separating Bangladesh from Myanmar, said Zayed, a Rohingya leader. The rest have moved elsewhere in the border district of Cox’s Bazar. Before the latest inflow, about 75,000 Rohinhya had fled to Bangladesh since October, joining tens of thousands already there and straining resources.

Some families were packing up to leave, fearing another violent crackdown, a Rohingya resident of Maungdaw in Myanmar told Reuters. “People here are feeling depressed and getting so scared, hearing that more troops are coming to do area clearance again,” the resident said on Saturday, seeking anonymity for fear of repercussions.

“We have no one to protect us here.”

The resident and a human rights monitor with sources in northern Rakhine said security forces had run intensive searches and arrested some Rohingya men. Kyaw Swar Tun, an administrator in the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, said security had been stepped up in the state’s north, but denied that Muslims were fleeing across the border.

“I don’t hear anything of Bengali people leaving or entering the country during these days,” he said, using a derogatory term for the Rohingya to imply they are interlopers from Bangladesh.

The treatment of the roughly one million Rohingya in Myanmar has emerged as the country’s most contentious human rights issue as it transitions from decades of harsh military rule. Myanmar denies citizenship to the Rohingya and classifies them as illegal immigrants, though they claim roots there dating back centuries.

Myanmar security forces continue to harrass Rohingya in Rakhine, said Noor Bashar, 26, who fled to Cox’s Bazar last week.

“Many more are still waiting to enter Bangladesh but it’s difficult, due to the increased patrolling,” she told Reuters.

Western Railways equips 200 more officials to impose fines for littering,"Activities that amount to depositing litter in unoccupied railway premises, putting up posters in any compartment or carriage without due permission and defacing railway property would be checked.

(Representational Image)

The Western Railway (WR) has authorised officials from other departments, in addition to the station masters and ticket collectors (TCs), to impose fines on commuters found littering on station premises. The move that will come into effect next week, would arm at least 200 more WR employees with the power to levy fines on erring commuters.

This, officials said, would improve cleanliness and maintenance in railway stations. In an official order issued last month, officials holding senior ranks in the operating, mechanical, engineering, medical, carriage and wagon departments and personnel from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) could impose fines on individuals affecting hygiene on railway premises.

Activities that amount to depositing litter in unoccupied railway premises, putting up posters in any compartment or carriage without due permission and defacing railway property would be checked.

“At least 10 per cent officials from each of these departments are included in the task. This will add to the presence of checking staff at the stations. We found that station masters and TCs were pre-occupied with their other duties to be able to catch such erring commuters on a regular basis. Enforcing the responsibility to more officials will help keep a better check,” a senior WR official said.

Fines between Rs 200 and Rs 500 would be levied on the erring commuters as a “penalty for affecting cleanliness”.

They would receive money receipts for the fines charged to them. Till July 2017, 24,772 cases had been registered against erring commuters and a total fine of Rs 47,46,510s had been received.

Comparatively, 7,448 cases with fines of Rs 7,86,877 on a monthly average were registered in 2016.

“This is a step in the right direction to ensure that cleanliness is maintained on the station premises. However, the railway officials must equally contribute to keeping a strict vigil on these erring commuters,” said Subhash Gupta, a railway activist.

"Nepal: Govt addresses Madhes party’s demand, moves Bill to amend Constitution","Rastriya Janata Party logo Rastriya Janata Party logo

THE NEPALESE government on Wednesday moved the much-awaited Constitution Amendment Bill after the Madhes-centric Rastriya Janata Party agreed to participate in the election process under the Constitution even if the Bill is defeated. They have so far been boycotting the elections.

Law Minister Yagya Bahadur Thapa moved the Bill that deals with enhanced representation of people from the Madhes region to Parliament and other electoral bodies while separate commissions will be dealing with issues related with local languages.

The Bill was moved after the top leaders of the three major parties — the Nepali Congress and the Maoist party of the ruling coalition, and the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist — agreed in a joint meeting on Wednesday to have the Bill settled through voting by August 21, two days before Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is scheduled to leave for Delhi on an official trip. The trip to Delhi will the Deuba’s first visit to India since assuming office two months ago.

La Liga 2017-18: Five key players to keep an eye on,"Gerard Deulofeu played well enough to convince Barcelona to activate its re-signing clause. (Source: Reuters) Gerard Deulofeu played well enough to convince Barcelona to activate its re-signing clause. (Source: Reuters)

The Spanish league lost Neymar in a record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain but still has plenty of star players on display, including the two, touted as the best in the world Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Barcelona also kept Luis Suarez, Real Madrid held on to Gareth Bale, and Atletico Madrid still has Antoine Griezmann. The top three teams did not make any blockbuster additions, but some talented players will keep the Spanish league attractive. Here are some of the players worth watching in Spain when the league kicks off Friday:

GERARD DEULOFEU

A product of Barcelona’s youth academy, Deulofeu is expected to take over Neymar’s spot in Barcelona’s attack along with Messi and Suarez. The 23-year-old Spaniard was bought back from Everton, which he had joined in 2015 after failing to make an impact with Barcelona’s first team.

He had spent seasons on loan at Everton (2013-14) and Sevilla (2014-15) before being bought by the English club. Deulofeu spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, scoring four league goals in 17 games.

He played well enough to convince Barcelona to activate its re-signing clause and bring back the forward, who can play on either flank.

MANUEL “NOLITO” AGUDO

The veteran forward is back in Spain after a short stint with Manchester City last season. Nolito signed with Sevilla and will reunite with manager Eduardo Berizzo, who coached him for two seasons at Celta Vigo.

The 30-year-old Nolito replaces Victor “Vitolo” Machin, who transferred to Atletico Madrid. Nolito, who played briefly for Barcelona in the early 2010s, was a member of Spain’s squad at the 2016 European Championship in France.

Spaniard winger Jesus Navas is also moving from City to Sevilla, returning to the team he played until 2013. Sevilla also added Colombian forward Luis Muriel, who was with Sampdoria.

PAULINHO

The 29-year-old Brazilian midfielder was Barcelona’s first signing after Neymar’s departure, arriving on a four-year contract in a transfer worth 40 million euros ($47 million).

A regular in Brazil’s national team, Paulinho played for Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in 2015. The versatile midfielder thrived with Brazilian club Corinthians before moving to the Premier League, standing out for his prowess as a defensive midfielder and his ability to help out in attack.

His signing came as a surprise to many because of his age and because he is not known for playing the ball-possession game characteristic of Barcelona. Paulinho is expected to fight for a starting spot with Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic.

The Catalan club also reinforced its defence by signing 23-year-old right back Nelson Semedo, the former Benfica player who was in Portugal’s squad at this year’s Confederations Cup.

VICTOR “VITOLO” MACHIN

Vitolo was signed by Atletico Madrid but will spend the first six months of his new contract playing for boyhood club Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

Atletico is not allowed to register any new players until 2018 because of a FIFA-imposed ban for having broken rules regarding the transfer of underage players. Coach Diego Simeone will only be able to count on the former Sevilla forward as from January.

The 27-year-old Vitolo was part of Las Palmas’ youth program before joining Sevilla in 2013. He helped the southern Spanish club win three Europa League titles from 2014-16 and has been capped 11 times by Spain, scoring four goals.

THEO HERNANDEZ

The 19-year-old French left back was in the centre of a dispute between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, choosing European champion Real instead of the team where he played most of his youth.

Atletico said Hernandez rejected several of its offers to renew his contract, which ran until 2021. Hernandez impressed last season while playing for newly promoted Spanish club Alaves on loan from Atletico. Alaves finished ninth in the Spanish league and reached the Copa del Rey final, which it lost to Barcelona.

Hernandez will likely have to fight for a starting spot with veteran Marcelo at Real, where he will be coached by countryman Zinedine Zidane.

Madrid also secured the signing of 21-year-old Dani Ceballos, the former Real Betis midfielder who was named the best player at the Under-21 European Championship this year. Madrid also bought 20-year-old centre half Jesus Vallejo, who was on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt last season.

"Swine flu death toll in Gujarat reaches 230, state seeks central aid","Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. PTI Photo Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. PTI Photo

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday visited civil hospitals in four major cities to take stock of the swine flu situation in the state, even as the death toll due to the H1N1 virus infection has gone up to 230. During his visit to a hospital in Vadodara, Rupani said he has requested the Centre to send a team of medical experts to the state to suggest steps to prevent the spread of the disease.

“Rupani along with state health minister Shankar Chaudhary, today visited Civil Hospitals of Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara and Ahmedabad to take first hand information about the measures being taken by respective authorities to tackle swine flu in the state,” a government release said.

Talking to PTI during his visit to Sir Sayajirao General Hospital in Vadodara, Rupani said, “Swine flu has claimed the lives of more than 200 people and 2,100 positive cases have been reported in the state so far, of which about 1,200 cases are reported from the four cities of Vadodara, Surat, Ahmedabad and Rajkot.”

“Hospitals in the state are equipped with ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and there is enough stock of tablets and other medicines. The government hospitals have set up isolation wards. But despite all these measures, we have requested the Centre to dispatch its team to the state to take stock of the situation and recommend ways to prevent the spread of the disease,” he said.

The government has set up isolation wards at all the government and civic hospitals and testing of the swine flu cases are being done in at least nine labs in the state, which was not possible till several years ago as the reports in this regard used to be sent to the labs located in Pune in Maharashtra for confirming the case of swine flu, the chief minister said.

According to the government release, during his visit to the hospitals, Rupani advised the doctors to give Tamiflu medicine to swine flu patients. Giving the slogan of ‘Any Flu-Tamiflu’, Rupani even recommended the use of this medicine to treat patients with general fever.

“Of the total cases of swine flu reported so far, almost 68 per cent cases have been reported in these four cities. During his visit to these four cities, Rupani interacted with doctors as well as patients and obtained details about the ongoing treatment,” it said.

Rupani informed reporters that Tamiflu was available in adequate amount in all government hospitals and is given free of cost. Patients in private hospitals, too, are being given treatment for swine flu free of cost, the release added.

As per the daily health bulletin issued by the state government, ten persons died due to swine flu in the state today, taking the death toll to 230 since January this year.

Out of the ten, three died in Ahmedabad city, while one each died in Amreli, Rajkot city, Kutch, Junagadh city, Rajkot district, Anand and Sabarkantha, said the bulletin. It said that 177 new cases of swine flu were registered in the state on Thursday.

Since January, 2,272 patients infected with H1N1 virus have been admitted in various hospitals across the state. Out of them, 857 have been have been cured, 1,225 are still under treatment while 230 have died, it said.

Decoded: Why expensive wines taste better,"It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images) It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Expensive wines appear to be tastier, say scientists who have found that a higher price tag on the bottle causes the reward centre in the brain to trick the taste processing regions.

The phenomenon that identical products are perceived differently due to differences in price is called the “marketing placebo effect.”

As with placebo medications, it has an effect solely due to ascribed properties: “Quality has its price!”

“However, it has so far been unclear how the price information ultimately causes more expensive wine to also be perceived as having a better taste in the brain,” said Bernd Weber, from the University of Bonn in Germany.

The researchers assessed how different prices are translated into corresponding taste experiences in the brain, even if the wine tasted does not differ.

Thirty participants took part in the study, of which 15 were women and 15 were men, with an average age of around 30 years.

The wine tasting took place lying down in an MRI scanner, allowing brain activity to be recorded “online” while participants were tasting the wines. Each time, the price of the wine was shown first.

Only then around a millilitre of the respective wine was given to the participants via a tube in their mouths. The participants were then asked to rate via a button on a nine-point scale how good the wine tasted to them.

Their mouths were then rinsed with a neutral liquid and the next identical wine sample was given for tasting.

Researchers conducted the tests using an average to good quality red wine with a retail bottle prize of 12 euros.

In the MRI scanner, the price of this wine was shown randomly as 3, 6 and 18 euros.

“As expected, the subjects stated that the wine with the higher price tasted better than an apparently cheaper one,” said Hilke Plassmann from the INSEAD Business School in France.

Identical wine leads to a better taste experience when a greater quality expectation is associated with the wine due to its price.

The measurements of brain activity in the MRI scanner confirmed this. The research team discovered that above all parts of the medial pre-frontal cortex and also the ventral striatum were activated more when prices were higher.

While the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly appears to be involved in integrating the price comparison and thus the expectation into the evaluation of the wine, the ventral striatum forms part of the brain’s reward and motivation system.

“The reward and motivation system is activated more significantly with higher prices and apparently increases the taste experience in this way,” said Weber.

“Ultimately, the reward and motivation system plays a trick on us,” said INSEAD post-doctoral fellow Liane Schmidt.

When prices are higher, it leads us to believe that a taste is present that is not only driven by the wine itself, because the products were objectively identical in all of the tastings.

മണിപ്പൂർ സമരനായിക ഇറോം ശർമ്മിളയും ഡെ​സ്മ​ണ്ട് കു​ടീ​ഞ്ഞോയും വിവാഹിതരായി,
Telescope: Prime time gaalis and golis,"Modi exhorted us to unite India, abjure violence in the name of faith and reminded us that neither rhetoric nor politics, “na gaali”, “na goli” will solve problems in Kashmir, only a warm embrace Modi exhorted us to unite India, abjure violence in the name of faith and reminded us that neither rhetoric nor politics, “na gaali”, “na goli” will solve problems in Kashmir, only a warm embrace

A “My dear brothers and sisters”, “beloved countrymen”, “Team India” — President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have promised us a “New India” in the next five years. In his first televised Independence Day address as the president, Kovind asked for a “compassionate” country forging ahead with “nation building”, Modi exhorted us to unite India, abjure violence in the name of faith and reminded us that neither rhetoric nor politics, “na gaali”, “na goli” will solve problems in Kashmir, only a warm embrace. Jai Hind, Vande Mataram.

It’s a pity that some of our brothers and sisters in the media are (wilfully?) hard of hearing. Perhaps because President Kovind spoke in a soft, statesmanlike manner — entirely alien to TV news culture — and PM Modi expressed all the correct sentiments — hey, what’s that?

Modi’s first Independence Day speech in 2014 remains his best TV moment — it was a rousing call to fight social evils. In the last two years, the soaring rhetoric has been weighed down by too many crores in his government’s achievements.

Some TV news channel editors and anchors seem weighed down by their super prime time ultra-nationalism. More “patriotic” than all their competitors — and 1.25 crore compatriots — they show little of the compassion President Kovind spoke or even common civility; they are supersonic loud, impolite, violent with their verbal “golis” — everything the PM advised against.

Last week, Arnab Goswami weighed in against, an “opportunistic” “man called Hamid Ansari” (Republic). That “man” had been the Vice President of India for 10 years. In a Rajya Sabha TV interview with Karan Thapar just before he stepped down as VP — he spoke of “a feeling of unease”, amongst Muslims. “Horrible!”, “Hypocritical”, denounced Goswami, “How can you talk like that?” He attacked Ansari, mocked him, saying he should have “quit” as VP if he felt Muslims were “insecure”, instead of enjoying the “perks” of office. More in the same insulting manner followed during the one-hour show.

Disagree with Mr Ansari until the cows come home (it’s still okay to say that, right?); denigrating him, is to insult not only him but the office he represented, that of the vice president. In Goswami’s words, it was “horrible” and made us not just uneasy, but queasy too.

On to Times Now. Singling out these two channels because they claim be the No.1 news channels. The Newshour topic? Singing Vande Mataram and celebrating, Independence Day in madrasas as directed by the Uttar Pradesh authorities.

Now, you’d think the issue to address was why only madrasas were so directed but no, it was “What’s communal about patriotism?”

Half-way into the scream and shout match, Ghanshyam Tiwari, Samajwadi Party, referred to the death of 30 children at Gorakhpur’s BRD hospital. Anchor-editor Navika Kumar immediately attacked the previous SP government for neglect and told him not to “lecture” them. Senior BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra jumped in where anyone must fear to tread, saying, yes, it was a “sad”, “bad” day, the deaths a “sensitive” matter but Vande Mataram was “equally sensitive” (really?). As Tiwari objected, “It is not, it is not… shame on you…”, Kumar agreed it was a “sad” day, Times Now was following the story, “but let us not beat our chests” as if this did not happen in Akhilesh Yadav’s time — “you are bringing this up because you are running away from the real issue”.

Really? Now what could be more “real” than human life and death?

For Kumar, and more so for the leading spokesman of the ruling BJP at the Centre and in UP, to be so dismissive of the human tragedy, one that involved young children, although not the topic of the debate (since when have they stuck to topics in these debates?), is in”sensitive”, un”real” and surely reflects misplaced priorities?

Many of us have said for a very long time that there is something very wrong with TV news. We rest our case.

Republic and Times Now did go after the UP government on the weekend — along with all news channels. As Aaj Tak asked, “Are only cows safe (in this country)?” and CNN News suggested “we are on a ventilator”. However, fundamental, “real” problems facing people in the country — the outbreak of swine flu, floods, crop distress, poor power supply, transport, infrastructure — subjects the PM addressed at the Red Fort — seldom, if ever, make it to these prime time punch and counter punch shows.

When will TV news get real or is that an unrealistic demand?

Bollywood actresses Sonal Chauhan and Sayani Gupta took a moment to compliment each other on the sidelines of the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter/Festive 2017 (LFW), which began here on Wednesday. Sonal and Sayani were the showstoppers for designers Sonal Verma and Shweta Kapur of the brand 431-88 respectively. During the post show conference, they were seen telling each other to keep the costumes that they were wearing.

Sayani told Sonal, pointing towards her kimono jacket: “The colour is so nice. It’s such a wonderful creation.” Sonal replied: “You should also keep this beautiful white glittery dress.”

Sayani, who was seen in films like Jolly LLB 2 and Fan, said her personal wardrobe is full of white clothes as she is obsessed with it. “I am obsessed with whites. During my recent trip to an international location, I came back realising that I bought everything white. Also, I am mad about shoes and sunglasses,” she said.

It sort of extends my fashion sense, but in overall personality, at least in my life, travelling has made huge differences,” she said.

Kenya is to launch a bid to host the athletics world championships in 2023 after successfully staging two other international competitions in the last 10 years.

No African nation has ever staged the sport’s flagship event, but Kenyan sports minister Hassan Wario said Kenya had shown its capability when it brought together athletes from 130 countries to compete in the IAAF World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi in July.

“We have shown that we are capable to host smaller events and it has now reached a time when we should host big competitions” said Wario at a welcome reception for Kenyan athletes who finished second overall at the just-concluded world championships in London, beaten only by the United

States.

“Kenya became the first African nation to win the world championship in Beijing in 2015, it is only fitting that we should be the first country to bring the championships to Africa,” Wario said.

“We have a plan to build three big stadiums in Nairobi, Mombasa and Eldoret and seven additional new ones in other parts of the country.” Wario echoed the recent call by Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) president Hamad Kalkaba Malboum for Africa to be awarded the World Championships by 2025.

Malboum said six African countries, including Kenya, are capable of hosting the event. The Qatari capital of Doha is set to host the 2019 IAAF

World Championships before Eugene, Oregon, stages the 2021 edition.

Leonardo Bonucci hoping for the Andrea Pirlo effect after moving to AC Milan,"Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. (Source: AP File) Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. (Source: AP File)

Not many players make the switch from AC Milan directly to Juventus, or vice versa. But Leonardo Bonucci hopes to prove as effective as another that did: Andrea Pirlo.

After winning the Serie A title with Milan in 2011, Pirlo moved to Juventus on a free transfer and kick-started the Bianconeri’s domination of Italian soccer, winning four more league trophies before moving to Major League Soccer in 2015.

Bonucci has gone the other way, joining Milan for a fee of more than 40 million euros ($45 million) after winning six straight Serie A titles with Juventus.

“I hope to do with Milan what Pirlo did with Juve,” Bonucci said in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.

Like Pirlo, Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. The Italy defender made his Serie A debut with Inter Milan in May 2006.

Bonucci joined Juventus in 2010 from Bari and was a key part of its rebuilding, becoming Italy’s top defender in the process. The 30-year-old Bonucci wants to do the same at Milan, but with even more success.

“I see a lot of parallels,” Bonucci said. “In fact, I chose Milan also because in my mind there is the idea of repeating the path I lived at Juventus, where we started from a reconstruction like is the case here, and ended up at the top.

“I want to go even higher here. Within four years I hope to manage to win the Champions League. I want to win everything.”

Juventus and Bonucci lost two Champions League finals in three years. Milan opens the season at Crotone on Sunday, with Bonucci as captain.

“It was a choice shared with the club, the coach and the squad,” Bonucci said. “I can make my charisma and experience available, but it’s the team that makes you that way. I’m lucky to have learned from great leaders like (Gianluigi) Buffon, (Alessandro) Del Piero and (Giorgio) Chiellini.”

Priyanka Chopra trolled for disrespecting Indian flag,"Priyanka Chopra has been trolled on Instagram for choosing to not wear a saree for Independence Day. Priyanka Chopra has been trolled on Instagram for choosing to not wear a saree for Independence Day.

Hollywood’s desi girl Priyanka Chopra is facing flak on social media yet again, and this time too, the issue is her choice of wardrobe. It all started when Priyanka posted a boomerang video on Instagram, in which she can be seen swirling her tricolor dupatta around, with the caption, “Independence Day #Vibes 🇮🇳#MyHeartBelongsToIndia #happyindependencedayindia #jaihind.” Now, trollers are fretting over the fact that why did the Baywatch actor choose to don a western outfit instead of a traditional saree for the occasion of Independence Day.

Her Instagram followers have accused her of disrespecting the flag and the nation. They even went to the limit of asking her not to come back to India.

“Please don’t return to India again,” said one user. Another one commented, “Don’t you have a salwar-kameez for this occasion?” “How about a sari,” said another, “At least on this auspicious day, you were expected in a sari.” While Priyanka is currently homeward-bound, looks like some supportive fans have taken it themselves to fight back for her.

Users have put up long notes like, “I am an Indian , I can wear whatever I want as well as Priyanka you are not anybody’s mother or father to judge, what to wear and what not to wear,it’s her life she Buy’s her own clothes she didn’t ask from you.” Another fan also came to Priyanka’s rescue and wrote, “Guys commenting negative comments: are you out of your mind? It’s a tricolour stole/dupatta. People all over India wear this combination on 15th August. This ain’t no flag. So when people win matches and wrap the flag around their body and run, that isn’t insult? Think before you talk.”

Priyanka was earlier trolled for wearing a knee-length dress while meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin, Germany.

"Mickey Arthur abused me and used poor language, says Umar Akmal","PCB issued a show cause notice against Umar Akmal. (Source: AP) PCB issued a show cause notice against Umar Akmal. (Source: AP)

Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal has alleged that national coach Mickey Arthur had used foul language when the right-hander reached the National Cricket Academy for training. Akmal was earlier, axed from the list of centrally contracted players.

“I stand by what I told the media earlier today. Mickey Arthur used first poor language and then abused me. Inzamam bhai and Mushtaq bhai (Ahmed) are both witnesses to this incident at the NCA,” Umar told while talking to PTI.

“When I reached there, first Grant and then our physio, Grant Luden refused to accommodate me saying they were only working with the centrally contracted players. I then went to Mickey and he told he was instructed only to work with the contracted players,” Umar said.

Explaining the conversation he had with Inzaman-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, he said, “He then told me to go and speak to Inzamam and Mushtaq. I went to them and spoke to them. They explained things to me about my status and reminded me I had failed the fitness test several times. They advised me to listen to what was being said to me. I said okay and then they told me to go and talk to Mickey again.” and added, “First he told me what I was doing at the Academy. He then told me I should go and play club cricket. And then he used poor and abusive language. I can tolerate anything but I don’t think anyone has the right to use such language.”

Meanwhile, a PCB official spoke to PTI and said that Umar Akmal can’t talk to media despite not being a centrally contracted player.

“He is not a centrally contracted player but he is still bound by clauses governing players even one year after his contract expires. He can’t speak to the media without first seeking permission from the board,” he said.

On the other hand, Akmal sustained on what he had said and demanded an intervention by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

“I want to know that after I was dropped for the West Indies tour did I complain or blame anyone? I admitted I needed to work harder on my fitness and game. “When I was sent back from the Champions Trophy which was a humiliating experience for me I didn’t say anything or speak in the media. I only admitted I needed to improve my fitness and I had to do better. I went to England for rehabilitation and remained positive. But today I went to the media because the head coach used bad language and he has no right to do this with any player and I want the PCB to look into this,” he said.

Birthday wishes to Arvind Kejriwal: Some lesser known facts about Delhi CM,"As Delhi CM celebrates his 47th birthday today, he is one of the favourite most politicians on social media.

North Korea delays Guam missile firing; U.S. says dialogue up to Kim Jong Un,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (AP Photo) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (AP Photo)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has delayed a decision on firing missiles towards Guam while he waits to see what the United States does, the North’s state media reported on Tuesday as the United States said any dialogue was up to Kim. The United States and South Korea have prepared for more joint military drills, which has infuriated the North, and experts warned Pyongyang could still go ahead with a provocative plan.

In his first public appearance in about two weeks, Kim inspected the command of the North’s army on Monday, examining a plan to fire four missiles aimed at landing near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, the official KCNA news agency reported. “He said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the latter will make an important decision as it already declared,” KCNA said. The DPRK stands for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

In photos released with the KCNA report, Kim was seen holding a baton and pointing at a map showing a flight path for the missiles appearing to start from North Korea’s east coast, flying over Japan toward Guam. North Korea has often threatened to attack the United States and its bases and released similar photos in the past but never followed through.

Pyongyang’s latest threat prompted a surge in tensions in the region last week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying the U.S. military was “locked and loaded” if North Korea acted unwisely. But U.S. officials have taken a gentler tone in recent days. Asked by reporters on Tuesday about the North Korean delay, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it was up to Kim to decide if he wants to talk to the United States. “We continue to be interested in finding a way to get to dialogue but that’s up to him,” Tillerson told reporters.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea’s decision to hold off was not enough and Pyongyang would have to show it was “intent on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.” “I think they would have to do quite a bit more,” Nauert said, adding, “They know what they need to do to get us to come to the negotiating table.

Prevent War

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday his government would prevent war by all means. “Military action on the Korean peninsula can only be decided by South Korea and no one else can decide to take military action without the consent of South Korea,” Moon said in a speech to commemorate the anniversary of the nation’s liberation from Japanese military rule in 1945. “The government, putting everything on the line, will block war by all means,” Moon said.

The Liberation Day holiday, celebrated by both North and South, will be followed next week by joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. Asian shares rose for a second day on Tuesday after Kim’s comments. The U.S. dollar and Treasury yields climbed after solid U.S. retail data and the easing in U.S.-North Korean rhetoric.

North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes to ward off perceived U.S. hostility, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions. A new study by a London-based think tank and an article in the New York Times that cited it said North Korea had obtained rocket engines probably from a Ukrainian factory via illicit networks.

But U.S. intelligence officials said on Tuesday that North Korea has the ability to produce its own missile engines and intelligence suggests the country does not need to rely on imports. Japan will seek further reassurance from Washington in meetings between Japan’s defence chief and foreign minister and their U.S. counterparts on Thursday.

“The strategic environment is becoming harsher and we need to discuss how we will respond to that,” a Japanese foreign ministry official said in a briefing in Tokyo. “We will look for the U.S. to reaffirm its defence commitment, including the nuclear deterrent.” China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has repeatedly urged Pyongyang to halt its weapons programme and at the same time urged South Korea and the United States to stop military drills to lower tensions.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a telephone conversation with Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s minister for foreign affairs, said tensions on the Korean peninsula were showing some signs of easing but had not passed. The parties involved should “make a correct judgment and wise choice by taking a responsible attitude toward history and people,” Wang said, according to a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.

U.S. Senator Edward Markey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s panel on East Asia, announced on Tuesday he would lead a delegation to Korea, Japan and China, “The unity of purpose between the United States and our allies in South Korea, Japan, and China is critical in the face of Pyongyang’s increasing nuclear threat,” Markey said in a statement.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor and military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, urged caution in assuming North Korea was bluffing with its missile threats. “There is no stepping back for North Korea. Those who don’t know the North very well fall into this trap every time (thinking they are easing threats) but we’ve seen this before.”

The United States and South Korea remain technically at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. North Korea is currently holding three U.S. citizens it accuses of espionage or hostile acts, but now is not the right time to discuss them, KCNA reported, citing a foreign ministry spokesman. Pyongyang has used detainees to extract concessions, including high-profile visitors from the United States, which has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea.

"Donald Trump orders probe into China’s trade practices, Beijing warns of retaliation","US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered a probe into China’s “unfair” trade practices and “theft” of American intellectual property, drawing a sharp reaction from Beijing which warned that it “will not sit idle” in the face of punitive US actions. Trump signed a memorandum that directs US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether an investigation is needed into alleged unfair Chinese trade practices. Shortly after Trump signed the directive, Lighthizer said his office will launch a probe and, “if needed, take action to preserve the future of US industry”.

Trump’s action comes amid rising tensions between the two nations over provocative missile tests and threats by Beijing’s ally North Korea. “The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,” Trump said.

“Today, I’m directing the United States Trade Representative to examine China’s policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of American technology and the theft of American intellectual property,” Trump said as he signed the memorandum.

“As President of the United States, it’s my duty and responsibility to protect the American workers, technology, and industry from unfair and abusive actions,” he said. Trump said his administration will stand up to any country that unlawfully forces American companies to transfer their valuable technology as a condition of market access.

Following Trump’s order and his remarks on crackdown on unfair trade practices, China’s commerce ministry issued a stern statement voicing “serious concern” and warning that any punitive measures will harm bilateral trade relations. “If the US side takes actions that impair the mutual trade relations, disregarding the facts and disrespecting multilateral trade rules, China will not sit idle,” the statement said.

China “is definitely going to adopt all appropriate measures to vigorously defend” its lawful rights and interest, it said. The country has “always been paying high attention to intellectual property right protection, continuously perfecting the legislation”, and that the progress it has made on that front is “obvious to all”, the commerce ministry said.

Trump said the US will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs and enforce the rules of fair and reciprocal trade that form the foundation of responsible commerce. “We will protect forgotten Americans who have been left behind by a global trade system that has failed to look — and I mean look — out for their interests. They have not been looking out at all,” he said.

Trump said the US Trade Representative Lighthizer is empowered to consider all available options at his disposal. “We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that is so vital to our security and to our prosperity. We will uphold our values, we will defend our workers, and we will protect the innovations, creations, and inventions that power our magnificent country,” he said.

Lighthizer said the US has for many years been facing a very serious problem. “China industrial policies and other practices reportedly have forced the transfer of vital US technology to Chinese companies,” he alleged. “We will engage in a thorough investigation and, if needed, take action to preserve the future of US industry. Thousands of jobs are at stake for our workers and for future generations. This will be one of USTR’s highest priorities, and we will report back to the President as soon as possible,” Lighthizer said.

Top American lawmakers welcomed the move. “I am pleased that President Trump has targeted China’s forced technology policies. These practices have unfairly forced American companies to surrender vital intellectual property to their Chinese competitors as the price for doing business,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.

Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi alleged that for years now, China’s brazenly unfair trade practices have weakened America’s economy and hurt American workers. Pelosi asked USTR to take steps against China’s theft of American trade-secrets, China’s piracy of other American intellectual property, including software and market barriers facing US businesses and products in China.

The bipartisan IP Commission also welcomed Trump’s decision. “The scale of Chinese forced transfer and theft of American intellectual property threatens these interests, both our prosperity and security, and thus US policy must address this set of issues,” said Dr Richard Ellings, director of the IP Commission and president of National Bureau of Asian Research.

India celebrated its 71st Independence Day with full vigour, colour and hope of improving with years to come. Celebrations were held across the country with many donning clothes in the colours of the tri colour and unfurling the national flag. But in Kashmir, restrictions were imposed in several areas to maintain law and order as separatists had called for a strike against Independence Day celebrations. But at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk, a Kashmiri Pandit woman chanted “Bharat mata ki jai”, repeatedly, on an empty street.

The video which was shared by Suresh Raina with the caption, “#Kashmiripandit lady chanting “Bharat mata ki jai” in Srinagar on #IndependenceDay! She is a brave heart! Salute! 🇮🇳 #Peace #Love #Safety 🙏” highlighted the woman chanting “Bharat mata ki jai! Vande mataram! Aap bhi bharat ke hain. Bharat mata ki jai bolna humara farz hain. (You are also from India. Saying ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ is our duty) Bharat mata ki jai!”.

During his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to the Kashmiris. He said, “On Kashmir, there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people (Algavwadi, mutthi bhar algavwadi, ye algavwadi jis prakar ke naye naye paintre rachte hain).”

Eating chocolate may provide relief from bowel disease,"ThinkStock Images ThinkStock Images

Consuming protein rich foods such as nuts, eggs, seeds, beans, poultry, yogurt, cheese and even chocolates may foster a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment, which could mean relief for people living with abdominal pain and diarrhoea of inflammatory bowel disease, a study has said.

These food items contain an appreciable amounts of tryptophan — an amino acid used in the buildup of proteins — which when fed on mice led to the development of immune cells that foster a tolerant gut, the study said. The findings indicated that a protein rich diet triggers the appearance of immune cells in Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) — a bacterium that normally lives in the gut, and together these promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut immune system.

“We established a link between one bacterial species — Lactobacillus reuteri — that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance,” said Marco Colonna, the Robert Rock Belliveau, Professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis. “The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had,” Belliveau added.

For the study, published in the journal Science, the team examined mice that had lived under sterile conditions since birth and was germ-free. When L. reuteri was introduced to these mice, the immune cells arose. Further, when tryptophan was doubled in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent.

Humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tracts. “The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” explained Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, Postdoctoral researcher from the varsity.

“High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population,” Cervantes-Barragan said.

Vast resources of the BJP could not turn right into wrong,"Ahmed Patel won the Gujarat Rajya sabha elections. Ahmed Patel won the Gujarat Rajya sabha elections.

The outcome of the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections, last week, is a fitting tribute to the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement. It came at the end of a month where an imperious ruling party, displaying a historically unprecedented level of arrogance and disregard for the law, sought once again to “manage” an election in its favour. It used intimidation tactics involving raids and last-minute attempts to derail the voting process. Despite those efforts, the Constitution and the rule of law was upheld. The Congress party stood vindicated.

No election to the Rajya Sabha has been as bitterly fought or as fraught with attempts at manipulation as the one this time in Gujarat. The Congress had to be cautious because it was dealing with a rival who does not comprehend the meaning of fair play. Our legislators in Gujarat, demonstrating the courage of their convictions, had actually gone before the media and made public, their allegations against the BJP’s agent. These allegations were not probed and the BJP, instead of behaving in a manner befitting a ruling party, tried to dismiss the allegations. However, the BJP’s pride came to a fall. The party made a crucial mistake. The two Congress MLAs who the BJP sought to break away, in their eagerness to please their new masters, showed their votes to their new masters in the BJP. Our authorised representative noticed this and the Congress filed a complaint before the Election Commission.

The Congress’ request was simple: Examine the video footage to determine if the offending MLAs had shown their ballots to anyone other than the authorised agent. A matter that could have been resolved in minutes was stretched to hours by the unnecessary bickering of the BJP.

The Congress held fast to the principles of law and the Constitution: If there was a violation, the Election Commission had to take action. The BJP spread false and irrelevant narratives. These ranged from the absurd — “the Congress didn’t file its complaint in the morning, so it shouldn’t be allowed to do so now” — to the desperate — “the Congress is attempting to manipulate the ECI”. The spurious objections were rightly rejected.

This, above all, was Amit Shah’s defeat. His reach far exceeded his grasp as he and his colleagues tried to subvert, first, the voting process and, then, the appellate mechanism. Blinded by hubris and political heft, the BJP leadership sought to turn this election into a referendum on their control over Gujarat. They were reminded that not all men and women have a price. The Congress rank and file rallied behind Ahmed Patel while the BJP sought to plant stories of factions and separations. The Congress stood together while the BJP propaganda machine did what it does best, spread vicious lies.

In this din, the Election Commission stood out as a beacon of hope for upholding the Constitution and the law. Despite six senior cabinet ministers attempting to “convince” the officers of the futility of the Congress cause, they acted as per the law. The entire country was witness as the Union Finance Minister and Union Law Minister abdicated their constitutional functions and acted as party pracharaks. The end result is that they stand exposed. The vast resources and influence at the BJP’s disposal could not turn right into wrong. In the conflict between truth and state power, truth and democracy prevailed.

These events are important for another reason. A section of the media was peddling a narrative that the BJP had pulled off canny political stratagems and the Congress should have been more careful. This was a disappointing display of attempting to be more loyal than the king.

Their reluctance to highlight the series of electoral malpractices by the BJP shows a deeper, and a more worrying, bias. It was akin to congratulating a thief for a well-executed theft and blaming the victim for not having installed sufficient alarms. Some news channels had even begun to write obituaries by early evening. But finally, none of that mattered.

This is also a reminder to the BJP. It has spent three years desperately usurping power, controlling the media and persecuting opponents by unbridled misuse of state power. Raids, false criminal cases and hounding everyone who disagrees with the government, appear to have become the new normal. This drama has also exposed where the BJP’s priorities lie. Their ministers run to the Election Commission to display their loyalty to their leaders, instead of performing the functions for which they have been elected. The government and the party apparatus is used only to subjugate, suppress and persecute. In one single night, the BJP crumbled unto itself when it found that it couldn’t bend the democratic institutions to its perverse will.

It would be too much to expect statesmanship from the BJP and for it to congratulate those who have won. But it would be appreciated if its leaders also find the time to govern a country growing increasingly tired of their brand of politics.

North Korean tensions aren’t deterring tourists from Guam,"The number of South Korean travelers in particular has been growing lately because five low-cost airlines started flying to Guam from South Korea, said Antonio Muna, the vice president of Guam Visitors Bureau. This helped boost arrival figures to a 20-year-high in July, Muna said. (Source: AP) The number of South Korean travelers in particular has been growing lately because five low-cost airlines started flying to Guam from South Korea, said Antonio Muna, the vice president of Guam Visitors Bureau.

Tourists haven’t been deterred from visiting the tropical island of Guam even though the U.S. territory has been the target of threats from North Korea during a week of angry words exchanged by Pyongyang and Washington.

Chiho Tsuchiya of Japan heard the news, but she decided to come anyway with her husband and two children. “I feel Japan and Korea also can get danger from North Korea, so staying home is the same,” said the 40-year-old. Won Hyung-jin, an official from Modetour, a large South Korean travel agency, said several customers called with concerns, but they weren’t worried enough to pay cancellation fees for their trips.

“It seems North Korea racks up tension once or twice every year, and travelers have become insensitive about it,” Won said. His company has sent about 5,000 travelers to Guam a month this year, mostly on package tours. The U.S. territory has a population of 160,000, but it attracted 1.5 million visitors last year. One third of Guam’s jobs are in the tourism industry.

Guam is a key outpost for the U.S. military, which uses it as a base for bombers and submarines. The island’s sandy beaches and aquamarine waters make it a popular getaway for travelers from Japan and South Korea. Guam is only about three hours by plane from major cities in both countries.

The number of South Korean travelers in particular has been growing lately because five low-cost airlines started flying to Guam from South Korea, said Antonio Muna, the vice president of Guam Visitors Bureau. This helped boost arrival figures to a 20-year-high in July, Muna said.

The threats came in a week in which longstanding tensions between the countries risked abruptly boiling over. New United Nations sanctions condemning the North’s rapidly developing nuclear program drew fresh ire and threats from Pyongyang. President Donald Trump responded by vowing to rain down “fire and fury” if challenged. The North then threatened to lob missiles near Guam.

Kenji Kikuchi, 39, arrived from Japan last week and planned to leave Tuesday as scheduled. He was aware of the threat from reading the local newspaper and was a little worried. But he said North Korea’s missiles would fall in the water not on Guam. His 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter weren’t concerned.“They talk about it, but they don’t care about it. So they like the sea and the pool,” he said.

The Guam Visitors Bureau has heard reports of cancellations, but Muna said it doesn’t yet have any concrete figures on how many took place. Officials are still expecting a strong August, Muna said. “Japan and Korea make over 90 percent of our arrivals. And they’re much closer to North Korea than Guam is,” Muna said.

The agency has been relaying assurances from the governor and defense officials that Guam is protected and safe, he said. Trump told Guam’s Republican governor the global attention would send more tourists to the island.

“You’re going to go up like tenfold with the expenditure of no money,” he told Gov. Eddie Calvo in a telephone conversation Calvo posted Sunday on Facebook. Trump said he’d been watching scenes of Guam on the news, and “it just looks like a beautiful place.”Calvo replied: “It’s paradise.” “We’ve got 95 percent occupancy and after all this stuff calms down, we’re going to have 110 percent occupancy,” Calvo said.

China’s Belt and Road acquisitions surge despite outbound capital crackdown,"At a summit in May, Xi pledged 4 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity. At a summit in May, Xi pledged 4 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.

Mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries that are part of the Belt and Road initiative are soaring, even as Beijing cracks down on China’s acquisitive conglomerates to restrict capital outflows. Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially linked to President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy totalled $33 billion as of Monday, surpassing the $31 billion tally for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at building a modern-day “Silk Road”, connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa. At a summit in May, Xi pledged $124 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.

The surge in Chinese companies’ acquisition-linked investments in the Belt and Road corridor comes as the volume of all outbound mergers and acquisitions from China has dropped 42 percent year-on-year as of Monday, the Thomson Reuters data showed. Beijing’s move to prop up the yuan by restricting the flow of capital outside the country and clamp down on debt-fuelled acquisitions to ensure financial stability has made it tougher for buyers to win approvals for deals abroad.

Regulators have tightened the screws further since June, reviewing deal agreements in minute detail and ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on overseas buying sprees, including HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group.

The heightened regulatory scrutiny of overseas acquisitions comes after companies spent a record $220 billion in 2016 on assets overseas, buying up everything from movie studios to European football clubs. The scrutiny, however, has not impacted Chinese companies’ pursuit of targets along the Belt and Road corridor, as those investments are considered strategic for the companies as well as the Chinese economy.

“People are thinking in a long-term approach when making investments along Belt and Road countries,” said Hilary Lau, a corporate and commercial lawyer and partner at the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. “The acquisitions are also policy-driven. There are funds allocated by Chinese banks and state funds for Belt and Road deals,” he said.

The number of Chinese deals targeting Belt and Road countries totalled 109 this year, compared to 175 in the whole of last year and 134 in 2015, the Thomson Reuters data showed.

APPROVAL PROCESS

Companies enjoy a relatively smooth approval process for deals along the Belt and Road project as regulators tend to put them in a different basket when reviewing outbound investments, according to lawyers and dealmakers. “If you are doing One Belt, One Road, that becomes the first sentence in the document” to the regulators, said a senior investment advisor at a Chinese company that has acquired several overseas businesses.

“It is a wise thing to point out early on,” said the advisor, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. The largest deal in a Belt and Road country so far this year was a Chinese consortium’s $11.6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties.

Other top deals include the $1.8 billion purchase of an 8 percent ownership interest in an Abu Dhabi oil company by the state-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corp, and HNA Group’s $1 billion acquisition of a logistics company, CWT Ltd, which has not yet closed.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s foreign exchange regulator, said this month that domestic companies would still be encouraged to participate in Belt and Road activities. HNA, which has seen at least two overseas deals hit a hurdle as a result of the crackdown on transferring money, has said it plans to prioritize investments that are in industries and regions mapped out under the Belt and Road initiative.

The belt and road acquisitions are predominantly in energy and infrastructure sectors, said Hilary Lau of Herbert Smith Freehills. “We’ve seen a lot of activities recently in Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The whole Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh corridor is also hot as it’s connecting the East and West,” he said.

Army to get six Apache attack helicopters at cost of Rs 4168 crore,"An Apache attack helicopter from the US Army’s 1st battalion (Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons) An Apache attack helicopter from the US Army’s 1st battalion (Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons)

The Indian army will soon be able to operate Apache attack helicopters as the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) cleared a long-pending proposal for the same, PTI reported. Six choppers will be procured for the army at a cost of Rs 4168 crore. The decision was taken at a meeting of the DAC chaired by defence minister Arun Jaitley. This is the first time that the Army will be able to operate attack helicopters as it has long been demanding its own fleet of such choppers besides the Air Force.

India, in the past, had ordered 22 Apache and Chinook helicopters from Boeing in 2015. The Apache choppers are operated in the armed forces of United States, Israel and The Netherlands among other nations. The Boeing AH-64 Apache can seat a two-man crew and is equipped with nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition, night vision systems, four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons capable of carrying hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The US, which reportedly has more than 800 Apaches in service, first used the chopper during military action in Panama in 1989.

The DAC has also cleared a proposal to procure two gas turbine engines for naval ships at a cost of Rs 490 crore, PTI said.

Former Australia batsman Mike Hussey has likened Virat Kohli’s competitive edge and sheer desire to win with that of former Australia captain Ricky Ponting. He explained Kohli’s aggressive captaincy style matches with what Ponting would try to achieve. “Kohli has been brilliant. I like the way he captains. I like his aggressive nature and his will to win. He had this desire to push his team as far as he could. He set very high standards during training and in the game. I do see some similarities with Ponting. The will to win, that competitiveness,” said Hussey to PTI during an interaction.

The Australian team will be in India next month, following their tour of Bangladesh, from September 17 to October 11 and they will play five ODIs and three T20Is. Hussey reckons the series will be a competitive affair. “It will be a good series hopefully. They play their one-day cricket well. They have some good players and have won some good (ODI) series here over the years, though not in the Tests. The key will be to not rely on any one player. It is not one person that is the key. Everyone needs to know what their job is and perform as well as they can,” said Hussey.

India are currently on a winning spree but Hussey believes victories over Sri Lanka shouldn’t be a benchmark of things to expect from Australia in the series. “I am sure their confidence will be high after the Sri Lanka series. They also have an excellent limited-overs team. However, a ODI series against Australia is different,” claimed the former left handed batsman who had recently claimed he was open to coaching CSK – the IPL side he had once represented.

CSK return to the IPL next season following a two year ban and Hussey expressed delight with the team making a comeback. “I am very excited about CSK being back. I have great memories (of CSK) as a player. Love the franchise. There will be challenges with the team coming back after two years out. They had a fantastic run with Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain. Stephen Fleming did a fantastic job as a coach, plus they had good support staff and good owner that allowed the players their way. These were ingredients to build a successful team. If they do things right, there is no reason why the CSK can’t be successful again,”he said.

Staying in the Tamil Nadu but shifting to TNPL, Hussey spoke highly of the Australian skipper. “Smith has been brilliant. He reads the game well. It obviously agreed with his own batting. Since he has been captain, his form has been incredible as well. He has been an excellent captain as well,” said Hussey.

With numerous youngsters coming through the IPL and domestic cricket, Hussey singled Washington Sundar as a special talent. “Sundar is talented, looks a very good player and KB Arun Karthick is a nice player too, bats very well. The TNPL is bringing to the fore some good cricketers, who can go on to play in the IPL and for India too.”

India vs Sri Lanka: Teardrop island’s sob story,"Sri Lankan captaincy was thrust on Dinesh Chandimal but he suffered a whitewash at the hands of India. Sri Lankan captaincy was thrust on Dinesh Chandimal but he suffered a whitewash at the hands of India.

Dinesh Chandimal stood beside the ropes staring vacantly as Virat Kohli and his colleagues celebrated feverishly having won the Test series. The Sri Lankan captain smiled when cameras panned towards him, but it was clearly a forced smile. Just four Tests into his new role, it seemed he was already feeling the heat.

His is not an unusual plight. Captaining the Sri Lankan team these days is like having a millstone around one’s neck. Or, to use a pop culture reference, it’s the cricketing equivalent of the cursed iron chair of Game of Thrones: no one sits on it comfortably. His predecessor Angelo Mathews too felt the pangs, before he decided to relinquish the uneasy crown. His predecessor, Tillakaratne Dilshan, was reported ousted by Mathews and several other players. Before that, Mahela Jayawardene gave the baton to Kumar Sangakkara, having sworn he would never lead the side after the attack on the team bus in Lahore. Sangakkara, for all his charisma and leadership skills, felt it was getting on his nerves. Rangana Herath was always reluctant.

Captaincy, then, was thrust on Chandimal, the third-most experienced player in the side. This reluctance is strange because Sri Lanka produced one of the finest, and eager, leaders cricket has ever seen: Arjuna Ranatunga. Asked if a Ranatunga was what the Sri Lankan team, in the throes of transition, needed, Sanath Jayasuriya, chairman of the selection committee, said: “Then I’ll be a much relieved and happy man…He’s a once in lifetime leader, so inspirational and charismatic. He comes across as a gruff person, but inside he’s loving and affectionate. But you don’t always get someone like him.”

For much of his reign, the Sri Lankan team was still a ragtag bunch, but still they forged an impression that they couldn’t be easily beaten, or bullied. “When you look at the present team and the team we had in the early 90s, I’d say this team has more talented players, but only that they are taking a lot of time to get adjusted to international cricket. We have to be patient,” Jayasuriya adds.

But as is often the case here, there is no succession plan. On a larger note, here nobody is groomed for anything. Either they do it naturally, or they don’t. “We are learning from our past mistakes and now we are putting in more effort to find players with leadership skills and deputing them with more responsibilities at a younger age. We should also give Chandi a little more time and see if his batting is not affected by captaincy,” he points out. The latter is a more worrying concern and a recurring pattern. Captaincy affected the careers of both Dilshan and Mathews. Naturally, they hope it isn’t the case with Chandimal.

Like Ranatunga, Sri Lanka also need a Dav Whatmore-like coach to mould them into a fighting unit. Of late, this job too has been a bit of a musical chair. The list in the last five years includes Trevor Bayliss, Stuart Law, Rumesh Ratnayake, Geoff Marsh, Graham Ford, Paul Farbrace, Marvan Atapattu, Graham Ford and now Nic Pothas. An irony considering that several Sri Lankan coaches, such as Chandika Hathurusinghe (Bangladesh), have built a steady reputation elsewhere. A stable coach and captain combination could be the first step in resurrecting Sri Lankan cricket.

***

The first time Aravinda de Silva cast his appreciatory eyes on Mahela Jayawardene was during an inter-school match where he was the guest of honour. He was instantly smitten by the youngster who authored languidly classical cover drives like the man himself. “The amount of time he had and the way he judged the length, I haven’t seen too many youngsters blessed like him. I immediately knew he would become a great batsman,”de Silva says.

He indeed became a great batsman, but not all schoolboy prodigies have gone on to scale Jayawardene-like heights. A couple of classic instances are Jehan Mubarak and Upul Tharanga, whose catalogue of international torment is well-storied. “Of course, it involves a lot of hard work, motivation and sacrifice to translate that potential into international cricket. Only a few in fact have made it into the big stage,” he says.

Yet, school and college cricket are romanticised in Sri Lanka like few other cricket-playing countries in the world. Every match is hyped up like an international match, with the steel bands in tow with subsets of fierce rivalries, like Trinity-Antonian in Kandy, or Royal-Thomian (also called the battle of blues) one in Colombo. The stands will be packed with not only friends and relatives and teachers, but also shrewd scouts from Colombo. After the match, deals are brokered.

De Silva snaps into a reverie. “The atmosphere used to be electric with a lot of fun in the stands, and sometimes even fights between fans of opposite sides. But in the end, it was a great day of enjoyment. That’s the foundation of Sri Lankan cricket, and that’s how we have all come through,” he says.

However, the school-college cricket culture is mostly an urban phenomenon, constricted to a handful of cities like Colombo, Kandy and Galle and its suburbs, a reason almost every other cricketer to have represented Sri Lankan are from the three pockets. And they invariably have to come packing to Colombo to ply in the big clubs and train at the Max Cricket Academy to chart their route to international cricket.

Hence, with a view to decentralise Sri Lankan cricket from the capital city, Academy’s High Performance Director Simon Willis says they are chalking out a more equitable model of workload management and manpower. “Now the main centre is here in Colombo, but more coaches and players will be sent to the other centres in Galle, Dambulla and Kandy, to make those centres more independent, so that the system can be accessed by more players. If we do that systematically, we can unearth perhaps more Malingas and Muralis. But there’s no exact timeframe for results to materialise. Five to ten years, or maybe more,” says Willis.

He was initially a bit puzzled by the emphasis on club cricket than provincial tournament. Then he realised, a structural overhaul may backfire. “This has a produced a lot of great cricketers, so changing it massively could be make it counterproductive. So you should look at how it can be made more competitive,” he says.

But how to make it more competitive is the uneasy question that confronts Sri Lankan cricket. Some like Jayawardene and Sangakkara have called for a massive tweaking of the structure and a more consistence selection policy. Players such as Dimuth Karunaratne have urged for more domestic matches – the most a domestic player gets to play is six three-day matches and a four four-day fixture. The corresponding List A numbers are seven while there’s no T20 domestic cricket at all. “We have to play more first-class cricket and then we can find more players who can dominate the game. That’s the thing SLC have to work on for the players,” he reckons.

Fast-bowling coach Chaminda Vaas believes the standard of the pitches should improve. “If we’ve more turners than seaming wickets, we end up producing just the spinners and spinners who could get wickets on bad pitches. Thus our batsmen will become better players of pace bowling as well. I’m not saying we should make only green tracks. There should be a mix of all, like it used to be in our days.” he points out. Jayasuriya too concurs with his former teammate. “We are taking all these suggestions, and trying to restore Sri Lankan cricket. Maybe, we could’ve planned things in a better way in the past. But at least, we have identified where we are lacking,” he says.

Such optimism, though, is rare to find in the salubrious isles.

***

Swivelling his hips and tapping his feet to the undulating bass of the band, amidst a bunch of rapturous school children, Percy Abeysekara, Sri Lankan cricket’s most famous fan, was soaking in the atmosphere. Even at 81, his enthusiasm is unfettered, but the palms can no longer wave the flag continuously. He gives it one of the eager kids, and reclines into the plastic chair, panting intermittently. “Getting old, I don’t know how long I can do this,” he admits.

It doesn’t impel his enthusiasm either that Sri Lankan cricket is in an abyss. It doesn’t bother him, though. “It was like when we started playing Test matches. We used to lose every match. I’m not somebody who supports the team when they’re only winning. In fact, if they’d been winning I wouldn’t have to cheer them,” he says.

He scans the near vacant stands of the Sinhalese Sports Club and breaks into a soliloquy. “If the stands are full and full of music, our boys will win. That’s soul of our cricket. Dance and music. Bring it back and we will win,” he says, before the papare resumes their sprightly music, and momentarily it’s forgotten that Sri Lanka are on the brink of an innings defeat.

A stand full of Percies? “Yeah that’s what I want.” His eyes wander around. Empty stares gaze back at him. That tells the story of Sri Lankan cricket.

"Last two years have taken heavy toll on Andy Murray, says mother","Andy Murray’s first Grand Slam win came at US Open in the year 2012. (Source: AP) Andy Murray’s first Grand Slam win came at US Open in the year 2012. (Source: AP)

The last two years on the relentless ATP Tour have taken their toll on Andy Murray, the three times grand slam champion’s mother Judy told Reuters.

Murray, Wimbledon winner in 2013 and 2016, crashed out of the tournament in the quarter-finals this year as a hip injury got the better of him.

He has not played since and is racing to be fit in time for the U.S. Open, where he won his first grand slam title in 2012. The tournament gets underway later this month.

“The last two years have taken a lot out of him,” Judy Murray, herself a coach who nurtured her son’s interest in tennis from a young age, said at the Edinburgh Book Festival.

“But the tennis calendar is relentless, it’s 11 months of the year, there’s hardly any gaps to have a rest and I kind of feel that it’s all caught up on him.”

The ATP Tour, which runs from the start of January to late November, offers little respite for players, whose ranking can suffer if they miss tournaments.

Asked if Murray, who is set to lose his number one ranking to Rafael Nadal next week, would be playing at the U.S. Open she said: “I hope so, I hope so,” before adding that she does not act as an official adviser.

“I advise him to rest, for sure, but since when do you listen to your mum?” she joked. Asked about seventh-ranked Johanna Konta, who this year became the first British woman to reach the last four at Wimbledon since 1978, Murray said she believed she had great potential.

“The last two years she’s gone from strength to strength and she’s a relative rookie at this level … but you can see (her new Belgian coach Wim Fissette) adding things to her game,” she said, adding that the opportunity for younger hopefuls was great as older well-known players slow down.

“She’s capable of winning a grand slam,” added Murray, who worked with Konta when she captained the British Fed Cup team.

Rajnath Singh says PM Narendra Modi’s remarks on Kashmiris heartwarming,"Union Minster Rajnath Singh. Union Minster Rajnath Singh.

The Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech about reaching out to Kashmiris was a “heartwarming gesture”, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in a signed article that was circulated by the government Wednesday.

“It was heartwarming to see the Prime Minister making his government’s stand clear when he said ‘na gaali na goli’ can resolve the complexities of the Kashmir issue. On the contrary it can only be resolved by embracing the common Kashmiri,” Rajnath Singh said in the article.

Rajnath sought to suggest that ordinary Kashmiris have been victims of machinations of “vested interests” working against peace in the Valley. “The Centre has been consistent in its belief that the common Kashmiri wants to be an active stakeholder in the peace process. They have been made victims by certain vested interests who do not want peace in the Kashmir valley,” he added in his signed article.

Rajnath also underlined that the Prime Minister’s remarks were an appeal to those resorting to violence to adopt democratic means to express their grievances.

Singh, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and has been its Chief Minister, suggested that Modi “empathised” with the families whose children died in the recent hospital tragedy in Gorakhpur.

“He empathised with those affected by the Gorakhpur tragedy and the recent natural calamities like floods and landslides which have affected many parts of the country. This was a reassuring statement to the victims to make from the ramparts of the Red Fort, that even in its celebratory moments, the nation is sensitive enough to not forget those suffering and unable to celebrate,” his article read.

"Get rid of top three BCCI office-bearers, CoA tells Supreme Court","CoA has urged the Supreme Court to remove the top three BCCI office-bearers. CoA has urged the Supreme Court to remove the top three BCCI office-bearers.

In one of the sharpest attacks on Indian cricket officialdom since it took charge in January, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has urged the Supreme Court to remove the top three BCCI office-bearers, stating that their conduct was “unfit” and that they weren’t in a position to “make good” on their undertakings of implementing the Lodha reforms.

While recommending the ouster of acting president C K Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and acting treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary, the CoA has asked for the management, administration and governance of Indian cricket to be entrusted exclusively in their hands till the new set of office-bearers is appointed via fresh elections.

This is the most stinging and significant of the CoA’s recommendations in their fifth status report that was submitted to the Supreme Court Tuesday, three days prior to the next hearing.

The report mentioned that Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke were removed from their posts of the BCCI president and secretary, respectively, through an order of apex court on January 2 and that “it was only fair” the current office-bearers be treated in the “same manner”.

“The current office-bearers of the BCCI have demonstrated scant regard for the directions issued by the Committee of Administrators and continue to flout the same with impunity,” the report reads. It further reports that the actions of the constituent members of the BCCI constituted “wilful disobedience” and demonstrated “overall resistance” to the Supreme Court’s order.

The CoA has also came down hard on the cricket board members for deliberately subverting the court directives during the BCCI’s July 26 Special General Meeting (SGM). They also lambasted BCCI CEO Rahul Johri’s exclusion along with that of the legal team from the last SGM, for which the Committee had show-caused the office-bearers.

“…the office-bearers instead of reprimanding the constituent members who were suggesting that BCCI officials including the CEO leave the meeting, did absolutely nothing. They came up with ingenious answers that CEO left of his own accord. Such a stand being taken by the office bearers is most unfortunate,” it stated.

The CoA directive mandated Johri’s presence at the meeting. The CEO was excluded citing the Supreme Court order that made only the state association/member office-bearers to attend the meeting. But the CoA felt that the decision was “pre-planned and orchestrated”.

The CoA pointed out how during the SGM, the high-court appointed Delhi and District Cricket Association Administrator, Justice (Retd) Vikramajit Sen, took a dig at the BCCI members saying, “There are some things the Lodha Committee had suggested and you are doing everything contrary to that.” The diversion tactics of the BCCI office-bearers also came for flak with the CoA noting, “The totally neutral expression ‘etc’ was treated as an excuse to bring in a series of issues aimed at unravelling the fundamental core of the reforms.”

Over the last six months, the CoA had tried to build consensus among members, informing them that it would be considerate towards one or two practical issues like three-member selection committee and one state-one vote.

But the BCCI SGM on July 26 objected to five points in the Lodha Committee recommendations – “One state-one vote; disqualifications of office-bearers (above 70 years of age and/or completing nine years with cooling-off periods); powers, duties and responsibilities of employers, office-bearers, functionaries, committees etc. (have to be dynamic and have to be decided by the board); number of selectors and constitution of the apex council.

The CoA also mentioned another instance relating to the same SGM which showed up the office bearers’ “impunity” revealing that they failed to communicate the decisions taken during the meeting to the Committee despite directions to that effect.

The CoA also flayed the general body for not adopting the new Conflict of Interest guidelines and the New Fund Disbursement Policy. The status report also spoke about prima facie “instances of malfeasance and misfeasance” of funds in certain state associations and asked for a committee to be appointed for investigation. They also recommended that the Supreme Court appoint an administrator in each state association to usher in reforms.

Four top J&K ministers in Delhi Friday to firm up support for Article 35A,"Jammu and Kashmir state Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. (Source: AP) Jammu and Kashmir state Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. (Source: AP)

The Jammu and Kashmir government is sending four top ministers to Delhi on Friday to explore further “legal support” for the state government in Supreme Court on Article 35A. They are also expected to explain to leaders at the Centre the “devastating implications” in case the constitutional provision is struck down and ensure the Union government backs the state’s stance in the apex court.

“We are going to Delhi on 18th (August) to see what can be done to put up a strong defence to our case,’’ state Law Minister Abdul Haq Khan said. “We will meet people and seek further legal opinion.”

He said the J&K government’s talks with the Centre have been “very fruitful”, and that PDP and BJP, coalition partners in the state, are talking at every level.

Appreciating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s views on ways to resolve the Kashmir impasse in his Independence Day speech, Khan said, “It (the speech) said everything. It gave everyone a lot of hope. So I don’t think there is any reason to worry.”

Khan was referring to Modi’s remarks that the Kashmir problem cannot be resolved through “gaali” (abuse) or “goli (bullets)”, and that change can “only come by embracing Kashmiris”.

Besides the Law Minister, his senior Cabinet colleagues Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu, Horticulture Minister Syed Basharat Bukhari and Information, Food and Supplies Minister Choudhary Zulfikar will travel to Delhi. Drabu was the PDP’s points person in the party’s talks with the BJP, which was represented by Ram Madhav, during the coalition formation.

Drabu and Madhav were also architects of the agenda of alliance between the two parties. He is seen as close to the BJP brass and is valued in Delhi, especially after he brought J&K under the Goods and Services

Tax regime without any major hassle. Bukhari is a former Law minister, while Choudhary is an influential Gujjar leader from Rajouri, and his presence in the group of ministers is said to be important.

Sources said Sangh Parivar outfits campaigning for removal of Article 35A have been trying to rope in the support of Gujjar Muslim population, especially in Pirpanchal region of Jammu, by promising that the Centre will provide Gujjars 14 per cent political reservation if they break away from the position of the Muslim majority in the state.

"Flanked by BJP leaders, Shankersinh Vaghela quits Assembly but ‘not politics’","Vaghela said the top Gujarat BJP leaders were present there as “part of their courtesy’’ towards him. (File Photo) Vaghela said the top Gujarat BJP leaders were present there as “part of their courtesy’’ towards him. (File Photo)

Senior politician Shankersinh Vaghela on Wednesday resigned from the Gujarat Assembly in the presence Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, his deputy Nitin Patel and two other key ministers Bhupendrasinh Chudasma and Pradipsinh Jadeja.

Vaghela later told reporters that he would neither join any political party nor float his own. He, however, maintained that he would not retire from politics. Though he had quit Congress on July 21 and also resigned as leader of the Opposition, Vaghela remained an MLA from Kapadvanj. In the recent Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, Vaghela had voted for BJP and not Congress’s Ahmed Patel, despite a whip.

The senior politician submitted his resignation from the Assembly to Speaker Ramanlal Vora at his chamber.

Vaghela said the top Gujarat BJP leaders were present there as “part of their courtesy’’ towards him. The senior politician said he would be “continuing to work for Gujarat’s GDP… growth, development and progress of Gujarat”. He said that he would continue to work for the development of the state till he was physically and mentally fit, and he thanked the people of Kapadvanj for voting for him in successive elections.

Since Vaghela quit Congress, the party witnessed resignations of six MLAs, including the then chief whip Balwantsinh Rajput, ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections and cross-voting by eight MLAs (including Vaghela) in the polls. Before their resignation from the Assembly, these eight were expelled from Congress for six years.

Commenting on Vaghela’s resignation from the Assembly, state Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki said, “We won the Rajya Sabha seat despite Vaghela’s strong opposition, indicating his leaving the party had no impact. ”

Coming to the aide of Pathankot residents, who have been complaining about nine railway crossings in the city, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has written to Union Railways Minister seeking permission for utilisation and development of the existing local Dalhousie Road Railway Station for arrival and backward departure of trains.

In a letter to the Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Amarinder urged him to accede to his request in order to tackle the congestion at Pathankot, and also to minimise pollution that was adversely affecting the health of local residents, said a government release. Pointing out that ROBs and RUBs were not feasible on this line due to narrow land availability, the Chief Minister sought the railways minister’s personal intervention to allow the state to use the Dalhousie railway station in public interest.

It may be noted that the narrow gauge railway track from Pathankot to Joginder Nagar was inaugurated in 1929, and takes off from the main railway station at Pathankot. With the passage of time, the city has expanded on either side of the track and become densely populated, leading to heavy congestion along the railway track. Besides, there are nine railway crossings on the railway line passing midway through the city and these remain closed during peak hours, resulting in heavy losses to business establishments, while also causing all sorts of pollution, the spokesperson pointed out.

Expired pesticide stock seized in raid on secret godown in Punjab,"The owners of the godown, Rajesh Kumar and Surya Bansal, are on the run. Both have been booked by the police. (Representational Image) The owners of the godown, Rajesh Kumar and Surya Bansal, are on the run. Both have been booked by the police. (Representational Image)

Following strict instructions by CM Amarinder Singh to clamp down on supply of spurious pesticides, Barnala police on Wednesday seized a stock of 5000 litre of expired pesticides from a secret godown in the name of Arjun Agro Chemicals.

The Agriculture Department had no information about this godown. However, two stamps of agriculture development officers were seized from the spot. The owners of the godown, Rajesh Kumar and Surya Bansal, are on the run. Both have been booked by the police.

On Sunday, two shops — Rajesh Agro Chemicals and Arora Agro Chemicals — belonging to the two accused had been sealed in Barnala. The crackdown on these shops led to the godown. The entire stock at the godown was found to be expired and most of the stock had no bills. Even in Mansa “fake” pesticides stock was seized on Sunday. The action comes after farmers complaining of whitefly attack on cotton crop alleged that pesticides had been ineffective. In 2015 as well huge stock of expired pesticides was seized in the state after whitefly attack.

"India can face China, Pakistan but threat is from inside: Farooq Abdullah","Farooq Abdullah said, “India can face China and Pakistan but unfortunately today the threat is from inside not from outside.” (File photo) Farooq Abdullah said, “India can face China and Pakistan but unfortunately today the threat is from inside not from outside.” (File photo)

India could face China and Pakistan but somebody within the country was determined to spoil everything, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said on Thursday without naming anyone.

Addressing opposition leaders, who came together for the ‘Sanjhi Virasat Bachao’ (save our composite culture) meeting hosted by rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister also spoke on the situation in the Valley.

“India can face China and Pakistan but unfortunately today the threat is from inside not from outside.”

“Andar koi chor baitha hua hai jo hamara beda garak kar raha hai (There is a thief sitting inside who is determined to spoil everything),” Abdullah added in an apparent broadside against the Centre.

Talking about Kashmir and Kashmiris, he said some people were trying to question their nationality.

“Who are they to ask us about our nationality? We Kashmiris chose India over Pakistan during Partition because India guarantees equality. And I say it with pride that I am an Indian Muslim,” he said.

“They are talking about unity (uniting the people) but are they creating the atmosphere for it? They talk a lot but lack in action,” Abdullah added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached out to Kashmiris in his Independence Day speech and sought a peaceful resolution to the problems in the Valley.

The Kashmir problem cannot be resolved by either bullets or by abuses. It can be resolved by embracing all Kashmiris, Modi had said.

Expressing grief over the situation in the region, Abdullah said, “We are loyal but it is painful that they are not large hearted.”

An all party delegation came to Kashmir to evaluate the situation there and also gave its report but nothing had been done on that, he added.

Independence notes: Different experiences in Portuguese Goa and British Malabar,"Luis de Assis Correia (left) and M Madhavan (right) (Express Photo) Luis de Assis Correia (left) and M Madhavan (right) (Express Photo)

In the mid twentieth century, India’s struggle for freedom was at its peak, and leading the movement from the front was the Congress with a nationalistic fervour. Apart from the British rule in most parts of the country, there were regions which were controlled by other European powers like the Portuguese and the French.

Amid the Congress’ freedom movement which involved a larger part of the country, there were a few regions which also saw a sudden rise in nationalist politics by parties against the Congress itself. At the stroke of midnight, the freedom finally arrived, largely with the efforts of the Congress. But what did this freedom mean to those who were neither ruled by the British, nor were they close enough to the Congress’ political centre? Far removed from the centre of Gandhian politics and the barbarity of Partition, how did the Independence of 1947 change their lives, if at all?

A Goan Catholic and a native from Kerala narrate what it meant for them to live in the India of the 1940s.

Luis de Assis Correia- “That time in Goa it was a criminal offence to even say ‘Jai Hind’.”

For the inhabitants of Goa, 1947 does in no way ring bells of freedom. Reeling under Portuguese governance until 1961, for the Goans the liberation of India from British rule was an experience far removed from what it was in other parts of the country. Luis de Assis Correia (89), currently a resident of Benaulim in Goa, grew up in a strict Catholic family and went on to join a student’s movement supportive of Subhash Chandra Bose. He recounts his days of sloganeering for India’s independence and then later for organising an overseas movement for Goa’s liberation from the Portuguese.

“I am an old fossil born in Goa, Portuguese India. My birth certificate says that I am a Portuguese of Aryan race. That was the way the Portuguese described the inhabitants of their colonies. I grew up in a Catholic home. My mother was a very strict Catholic. When the Second World War broke out, my father was in the British navy. He was stationed at Tuticurin. In December 1940 he was sent to England, where he passed away.

After my father’s death my family decided to send me to Madras for my education since the war had made things very unsafe. I did not know any English back then since my education was completely in Portuguese and Latin. My family arranged for a tutor to teach me English in Madras.

In Madras, I joined a students’ movement supportive of Subhash Chandra Bose’s INA. That was when I became familiar with the nationalist movement. But after Japan attacked Pearl Harbour and then moved to the Pacific, two bombs were hurled at the Madras harbour and our locality was declared a war zone. We were evacuated and we stayed at a camp in Kudumbakam. They gave us Re. 1 as daily allowance and we would buy coconut water with that money since we could not tolerate the water they served us.

Four days later, our warden came and told me that I would be sent back to Goa through Bangalore. My relatives got me from Bangalore and in Goa I was admitted in class 4. This was 1943.

Four years later India attained Independence. That time in Goa it was a criminal offence to even say ‘Jai Hind’. Three days before August 15, absolute curfew was imposed in Goa. There was no electricity. The Portuguese government banned all kinds of celebrations. I had written a speech on the INA to read out in my school on August 15. The censor board passed it because they hardly knew anything about the INA. They just knew that the Japanese supported the INA and were happy that now Japan would take control from the British. Later however, the police found out and stopped me from reading it aloud.

Because of the curfew in Goa, I got to learn all about Independence and Nehru’s take over and Partition only later from my friends in Bombay. As such though the Partition had no impact on Goa.

After Indian Independence, Portugal became absolutely anti-India. Nehru wanted Goa to be liberated from Portuguese control. He called Goa a ‘pimple on India’s face’. At that time I was completely against the Portuguese PM António de Oliveira Salazar. He had been a dictator for 28 years. He did not want us to get educated at all. Our life was always controlled and censored. We had no freedom of speech. Even wedding cards had to get cleared. We had to explain everyday of our lives to someone or the other.

In 1958 I moved to Kenya to work for a Uganda based company. There I would often go about spreading awareness about the Goan liberation movement. When Goa attained Independence in 1961 I was still in Kenya. We rejoiced there but I could not come home since I still held a Portuguese passport.

However, the liberation of Goa did not make me happy. The people who came to power, the so called freedom fighters, forced out all educated Goans. Many of them have still not come back. The police and army were replaced with the Indian army. They forced their law on us. We all believed that life would improve after Independence. But once we were liberated, Nehru forgot all his promises.”

M. Madhavan- “After Independence, as far as we were concerned there was no change in our lifestyle.”

M. Madhavan (Express Photo) M. Madhavan (Express Photo)

Retired sports journalist, M Madhavan was born in Kannur district which was part of the Madras Presidency back in the 1930s. He moved to Burma six to eight months after he was born as his father got a job in the Burma railways. He came back to Kannur on the eve of the Second World War in 1939, at a time when the fight for freedom was at its peak in India. He recounts his days when political protests had become the best excuse to bunk classes and the rise of the communist movement in the south, which he happened to join as a young school boy.

“I was seven or eight years old when my family came back from Burma. The fear of war was such that we had to come back. That was the time of the independence movement. I remember we used to boycott classes for a political movement if Nehru or Gandhi was arrested. People would go for hartals and we would simply get out of class and go home. I never went for the hartals, but it was a good way to avoid classes.

My family belonged to the landed community. We were not involved in any kind of political agitation. It is not that they supported the British. They just remained neutral. Only the Congress was agitating. Rest of the people were not organising any movement, neither did they know much. However, at home we did discuss about Nehru and Gandhi and would be sympathetic towards their cause.

On August 15, we had a flag hoisting ceremony in our school. People were very happy because most of the leaders who had been arrested were released that day. My school authorities also suddenly turned nationalistic. Before independence, they would be very much against these agitations. They were quite pro-British and would not allow us to go on hartals and all. However, after independence they completely changed.

Though we knew about Partition, we did not discuss it much since we were not exactly affected by it. In my hometown, the relations between Hindus and Muslims were very firm. We did read about all the killings that were taking place in the North. People would talk about it and we would also read in the newspapers. We would also hear about Gandhiji’s satyagraha and many people getting beaten up by the police and still he was continuing, fighting for the cause of India.

During my school days, the Communist movement had just started taking shape and they were growing very strong. The Students Federation of India (SFI) was also coming up then. I was also part of it. But I never did anything apart from following them around. If they asked us to come out of class, we would do so. The SFI was very anti-British. Mostly they would carry out their movement underground. The police would be after them. When my father came to know about me becoming a part of SFI he told me not to go out of my way, or else I might get beaten up. But at that time I was very influenced by my friends and would go ahead with whatever they did.

After Independence, as far as we were concerned there was no change in our lifestyle. The governor of Madras exercised authority over my area. However, rest all his officials were Indians. So the British were barely present in our area even before Independence. For me the British were there somewhere, but I barely knew anything about them. After Independence, we naturally did not feel any difference. We just knew that we were independent now, ruling over ourselves.”

Child Genius’ Indian-origin contestant becomes overnight British sensation,"12-year-old Indian-origin contestant, Rahul. (Source: YouTube) 12-year-old Indian-origin contestant, Rahul. (Source: YouTube)

A 12-year-old Indian-origin contestant on a British television show has become an overnight sensation after he answered all questions correctly. Rahul, whose surname is not being revealed, got all 14 of his questions correct in the first round of the latest series of ‘Child Genius’, a show broadcast by Channel 4.

He has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club – the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world.

However, as neither scientist is recorded as having taken an IQ test, the scores are only estimates.

On the TV show, 20 contestants aged eight to 12 will be whittled down to one winner over the course of a week.

Rahul achieved full marks in a spelling test, correctly reciting the letters in words like garrulous, accouchement, and hyponatraemia (low level of sodium in the blood).

In a timed memory round, he answered 14 questions out of 15 correctly, but did not have time to answer the final question.

“I always want to do the best, and I’ll do that no matter what the cost. I think I’m a genius. I’m good at mental maths, general knowledge and I find it quite easy to memorise stuff,” said Rahul, who cites his favourite language as Latin.

“Most kids want immediate gratification but I also want long-term gratification. If I could play maybe my Xbox now, I’ll be really happy now, but I might be sad later on because I haven’t revised for my test,” he said.

His success in the first round of the show made him an instant social media hit.

One Twitter user joked: “Rahul could negotiate peace between North Korea and the USA.”

While he narrowly lost out in a maths round, he is exempt from elimination due to his high score.

Rahul’s IT manager father, Minesh, and pharmacist mother Komal said their son was in the game to win and their role was to encourage him.

“We are here to win. There’s no two ways about that. We’re all achievers. I used to play table tennis for Barnet council. We’re always trying to better ourselves,” said Minesh.

The show’s finale will take place over the weekend to crown the UK’s brightest child.

"Perks of BCCI officials: 3.23 crore spent on Choudhary and Chaudhry, says CoA","BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary (left) and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry. Express BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary (left) and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry. Express

IN THEIR fifth progress report submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the committee of administrators (CoA) have noted that the BCCI spent a total of Rs 4.62 crore on their office-bearers’ travels over the last two years. That includes Rs 1.71 crore and Rs 1.56 crore — Rs 3.23 cr in total — spent on treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry and acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, along with their respective personal executives, alone. The money the BCCI has spent on daily allowance for their two senior officials itself accounts to Rs 75.07 and Rs 42.05 lakh respectively.

It’s learnt that while the board finances the flights-office-bearers are eligible for business class travel-and hotel stay, they also foot the dining bills for the likes of Choudhary and Chaudhry along with their executives. Other expenses include credit card, ground transport, office expenses and telephone expenses.

Generous allowances

According to the board’s policy, each office-bearer gets Rs 30,000 as daily allowance within India and 700 US dollars when traveling abroad for meetings or official visits. Each office-bearer’s executive assistant gets Rs 10,000 as daily allowance and provided transport facilities while they get 200 US dollars as daily allowance during foreign trips. Chaudhry’s personal executive, Gaurav Virmani, has been paid Rs 25.08 lakh, in all, as daily allowances since 2015.

Incidentally it’s not just the office-bearers who the board caters to. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri gets 500 US dollars per day when abroad, whereas general managers, MV Sridhar and Ratnakar Shetty, have been given 300 US dollars during overseas visits. Sridhar and Shetty, meanwhile, get paid Rs 5000 as daily allowances within India.

There’s also the question of logistics in terms of the multiple visits that office-bearers like Choudhary, Chaudhry and acting president CK Khanna have to make to Mumbai for the various board meetings held at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. While Choudhary is based out of Ranchi, Chaudhry hails from Bhiwani in Haryana while Khanna stays in Delhi. And this is the very reason why the CoA have recommended in their report that the various functions of the board be delineated from the managing committee, which is made up of the office-bearers, and the professional management, which includes the CEO and general managers. And it’s the CoA’s opinion that the daily functioning of the board be conducted by the CEO and other employees of the board to avoid the incessant travel expenses incurred in lieu of the office-bearers’ visits.

“Such delineation of functions, power duties and obligations is also meant to facilitate smooth and efficient functioning of the BCCI because the professional management (full-time employees) are based in the BCCI headquarters at Mumbai whereas elected office bearers and other members of the Apex Council (managing committee) would be based in the different places across the country. The BCCI currently incurs substantial expenses in the form of air travel, hotel stay, ground transport as well as travel and other allowances to the honorary office bearers including when they travel to Mumbai in connection with the discharge of their duties,” the report reads.

Huawei Mate 10 launch slated to happen on October 16: Report,"Huawei has stared sending media invites for the launch of the Mate 10, according to media reports. Huawei has stared sending media invites for the launch of the Mate 10, according to media reports.

Huawei has issued press invites for the launch of its next-generation flagship smartphone, likely to be the Mate 10. The invite doesn’t reveal much, it only shows etched “10” with the words “Meet the device worth waiting for”, according to TechRadar. The event is scheduled for October 16 in Munich, Germany.

A lot has been said and written about the Huawei Mate 10 for quite sometime. In fact, Huawei’s CEO has already confirmed the existence of the flagship smartphone. The executive recently claimed that the company will improve the camera quality in the Mate 10, while also adding a fast charging battery in the smartphone. The company, told Bloomberg in an interview that the Mate 10 will go head-to-head with the Apple iPhone 8, when it launches later this year.

Pretty much everyone seems to believe that the Huawei Mate 10 will have a bezel-less design, similar to the Essential phone and Galaxy S8+. A recent leaked render revealed that the Mate 10 will get a 6.1-inch display and Quad HD resolution. The screen is said to piratically cover the entire front of the phone.Rumor has it that the phone will come with a vertical Leica-branded dual-cameras on the back. Contrary to rumours, Huawei Mate 10 won’t feature a fingerprint scanner embedded in the phone’s display. Instead, the fingerprint scanner will be seen on the back.

The upcoming Mate 10 is shaping to be a powerful smartphone under the hood. A recent post from an industry analyst on Chinese social media platform Weibo indicates that the Mate 10 will be the company’s first smartphone to be powered by the Kirin 970 chipset that will be built on a 10nm process. The phone will run on Android 7.1 Nougat, and will be backed by a 4,000mAh battery.

Of late, Huawei has been focusing on the high-end of the smartphone market in order to better compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung. It’s now the world’s third largest smartphone maker, but the company is struggling to make its presence felt in markets like India and Indonesia.

In his new book, Neel Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human beings by human beings

Title: A State of Freedom

Author: Neel Mukherjee

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Pages: 278

Price: Rs 599

If Neel Mukherjee’s Booker-shortlisted The Lives of Others (2014) was a diachronic dissection of the Ghosh family, spanning lifetimes, in his latest offering, A State of Freedom, he uses his linguistic scalpel for a synchronic cutting open of India’s now and here. Less a novel than a set of five linked narratives, their lengths ranging from a brief eight pages to a novella-length 100, A State of Freedom is probably the most sustained reflection on class in post-Liberalisation India in contemporary fiction. Reminiscent of two monumental works of non-fiction, P Sainath’s path-breaking Everybody Loves a Good Drought, published over two decades ago, and Sudeep Chakravarti’s Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country, published in 2008, Mukherjee’s novel brings back to the discussion table issues that seem to have fallen out of favour with the chatterati and the intelligentsia these last few years.

From the opening narrative’s unnamed protagonist, the Kolkata-born and–bred “tourist in his own country”, whose two decades in “the academic communities of the East Coast of the USA [have] defanged him of the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants”, to the second narrative’s first-person narrator, a London-based designer, also Kolkata-born, who too is appalled at the way in which supposedly educated people like his own parents treat domestic workers in India, to the “servants” themselves, who are the subjects of the three remaining narratives, Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human being by human being in every story.

Yet, as the protagonists of his stories seem to believe, and Mukherjee himself seems to at times, not all human beings are equal, or, more problematically, capable of being equal. In the second narrative, the first-person narrator parenthetically describes his own use of the term “domestic help” thus: “(My mother’s generation still called them servants. My politically correct tag [i.e. domestic help] had not a jot of correlation to their status: their position in the Indian social hierarchy or economy had never changed)”. But this ironic self-deprecatory statement is marred by the statement, a few lines earlier, of the creation of the state of Jharkhand “carved out… after decades of agitation and activism by tribal peoples and backward castes — they had that dreaded Indian distinction, the branding iron of an acronym: OBC, Other Backward Castes — for a separate state…” etc. One notes several things here. First, the bleeding-heart-liberal championing of the underdog (tribals and backward castes); second, the use of the adjective “Indian” (see all the quotes above — Indian ability, Indian social hierarchy, dreaded Indian distinction); and, finally, the egregious error about the expanded form of “OBC”, which stands for “Other Backward Classes” and not “Other Backward Castes”. Is this the narrator’s error or Mukherjee’s? And is the repeated use of the adjective “Indian” to indicate primitive, casteist, sexist, class-biased positions a reflection of the narrators’ views or Mukherjee’s own? Not an easy question to answer.

A central takeaway from this beautifully written novel is that if one is born in middle-class, relatively privileged, urban India (a member of the English-medium class) one can only imbibe democratic and human values, and develop the ability to look critically at oneself, if one lives in the West; remaining in India dooms one to continue one’s horrifically solipsistic middle-class existence, treating everyone who is one’s social inferior with contempt and brutality. Such, for example, are the people who are Milly’s employers — the domestic help/servant who moves from the underdeveloped Naxal-infested jungles of Jharkhand to the highrises of Bombay/Mumbai (where she works for the parents of the second story’s narrator, among others) — one of whom, in Kolkata, is described as having picked up and thrown a 10-year-old boy “down the hole through which the lift goes up and down”. Milly, central figure in the novella-length narrative, is told she “should be grateful for what you have — things are far worse out there” by the tribal Christian woman who had got her a job as a domestic worker.

Mukherjee’s novel strikes all the right guilt-ridden-anti-capitalist-liberal-pinko-lefty chords so beloved of the West’s educated classes: middle-class Indians (who are actually pretty near the top of the class hierarchy, and so, should be seen as rich) are brutal exploiters of innocent tribals; innocent tribals who convert to Christianity end up exploiting their own people; development has only added modern forms of misery and enslavement to India’s traditional heritage of discrimination and violence; the only way out of this seems to be death, whether willed or otherwise. No wonder it has won high praise from Western critics. But for this reviewer, the biases that Mukherjee seeks to lay bare with his cutting prose end up revealing some of his own — and these are not always very pretty.

A magnificently written, marvellously phrased book, with its heart in its right place, A State of Freedom might not be quite what its Western critics claim (“devastating portrait of the inhumanity of the rich to the poor”, and so on) but it is certainly worth the read, if only to discover what it stumbles in attempting as also what it succeeds in achieving.

"Rhetoric over, drive to ease NAFTA impact on workers begins","Trump promised to renegotiate the 23-year-old deal -or walk away from it. Now the time has come. Five days of talks aimed at overhauling NAFTA begin Wednesday in Washington, with negotiations to follow in Mexico and Canada. The United States has never before tried to overhaul a major trade agreement. So analysts aren’t sure what will emerge from the talks. Trump promised to renegotiate the 23-year-old deal -or walk away from it. Now the time has come. Five days of talks aimed at overhauling NAFTA begin Wednesday in Washington, with negotiations to follow in Mexico and Canada. The United States has never before tried to overhaul a major trade agreement. So analysts aren’t sure what will emerge from the talks.

Of all the trade deals he lambasted on the campaign trail as threats to American workers, President Donald Trump reserved particular scorn for one: The North American Free Trade Agreement. The NAFTA agreement with Mexico and Canada was “the worst trade deal in history,” candidate Trump declared. He accused NAFTA of having swollen America’s trade deficit with Mexico, pulled factories south of the border and killed jobs across the United States.

Trump promised to renegotiate the 23-year-old deal -or walk away from it. Now the time has come. Five days of talks aimed at overhauling NAFTA begin Wednesday in Washington, with negotiations to follow in Mexico and Canada. The United States has never before tried to overhaul a major trade agreement. So analysts aren’t sure what will emerge from the talks.

But it’s clear that delivering on Trump’s campaign promises will be difficult. A new version of NAFTA would require approval from a divided Congress. And even an improved NAFTA might not deliver the payoff Trump and his supporters are hoping for: The restoration of millions of lost manufacturing jobs. Economists and trade analysts do see opportunities to improve NAFTA, which eliminated most barriers on trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico. If nothing else, the pact could be updated to reflect the growth of the digital economy.

But a technocratic rewrite is unlikely to satisfy Trump supporters and NAFTA critics who want a revamped agreement to shrink America’s trade deficit and return jobs to the United States. A more aggressive approach _ demanding more made-in-America content for products that qualify for NAFTA’s duty-free status, for example risks imperiling some benefits that Americans think the trade deal provided to them

American farmers, for example, fear losing easy access to the Mexican market. Manufacturing companies have built supply chains that crisscross NAFTA borders; they worry about having investments jeopardized. And Canada and Mexico are sure to respond to any harsh American demands with their own. Plus, the clock is ticking. Next year brings a presidential election in Mexico and congressional elections in the United States. Forging a complex agreement will be even tougher if the political temperature is running hot.

Last month, the Trump administration listed its objectives for the renegotiation. Some of them will meet fierce resistance from Canadian and Mexican negotiators. The administration has riled Canada, for example, by saying it wants to eliminate a dispute-resolution process established under NAFTA. That process lets Mexico and Canada appeal unfavorable rulings by U.S. courts and agencies in trade cases. They can appeal to five-person NAFTA panels, composed of two members from each county in the dispute and a fifth that usually alternates between them. The panels’ rulings are binding.

But the panels have a reputation for overturning U.S. trade decisions. That is especially so in cases involving Canadian softwood timber imports to the United States _ a long-standing source of conflict. America complains that Canada subsidizes its loggers, allowing them to dump cheap timber in the United States. “We lose lots of sales,” says Jason Brochu, co-president of Pleasant River Lumber in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. “It’s not fair to have subsidized lumber come in unchecked.” The ruling panels, he says, lack “a proper dispute-resolution process.” He’d like to see them eliminated.

That idea causes heartburn in Ottawa. Before they could rely on the panels, Canadians “felt they were not getting a fair shake” in US courts and administrative proceedings, says Daniel Ujczo, a trade lawyer with Dickson Wright in Columbus, Ohio. “They see (the panels) as something they earned.” The United States also wants more leeway to slap tariffs on imports that are found to hurt American industry. For now, NAFTA limits America’s ability to use that power in cases involving Canada and Mexico. If America imposes taxes on their exports, would Canada and Mexico retaliate with their own tariffs?

In another attempt to ensure that any revamped pact promotes US manufacturing, the Trump administration wants tougher rules requiring that goods that qualify for NAFTA benefits are actually made mostly inside the three-country free-trade bloc _ and don’t include too many components from, say, China. Manufacturers, which have built supply chains that straddle NAFTA borders, worry that a NAFTA redo will disrupt their operations. Magna International, an auto supplier based in Aurora, Ontario, for instance, has 55 manufacturing plants in the United States, 50 in Canada and 30 in Mexico. Its products, such as car-seat components, can cross NAFTA borders five or six times. If it had to pay tariffs at each border crossing or produce more paperwork to prove where parts originated, Magna’s costs would rise.

If a NAFTA overhaul raises costs, “eventually that cost is going to get to you _ you, the end consumer,” says Scott Paradise, a Magna senior executive.

American consumers have benefited, after all, from low-cost small cars built south of border.

Renegotiating NAFTA is part of the administration’s plan to restore a chunk of the 7 million factory jobs America has lost since US manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. NAFTA lured many manufacturers to Mexico to capitalize on cheaper labor.

But Matthew Gold, a former US trade official who teaches at Fordham University’s School of Law, says robots and competition from China have played a bigger role in wiping out American factory jobs.

“Nothing in the NAFTA renegotiation will bring back that tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs that America lost to automation and to trade with China in the years since we entered into NAFTA,” he says. “While this renegotiation will improve NAFTA, it will be a great disappointment to those who expect the see its impact on their lives.”

President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon said there’s no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president’s recent pledge to answer further aggression with “fire and fury.” In an interview with The American Prospect posted online on Wednesday, Bannon told the liberal publication that the US is losing the economic race against China. He also spoke about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.

Bannon was also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as “losers,” “a fringe element” and “a collection of clowns.” The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “There’s no military solution (to North Korea’s nuclear threats), forget it,” Bannon said. “Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us.”

Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “made a very wise and well-reasoned decision” by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory of Guam. Bannon also outlined his push for the US to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China’s leader to do. Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China. “The economic war with China is everything,” Bannon said.

“And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we’re five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we’ll never be able to recover.” A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Wednesday both sides have benefited from trade.

Asked about Bannon’s comments, Hua said at a regular new briefing, “There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.” Hua appealed for dialogue to “preserve the sound and steady growth of China-US relations.” Bannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House.

The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump’s closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. The president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.

Earlier this week, the president passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he’s a “good person” and not a racist, adding that “we’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.” The latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Mobile videos may help parents stick to infants’ sleep practices,"The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo) The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo)

A mobile programme of informational videos and messages may improve parents’ adherence to safe sleep practices for infants, new research has found. The researchers tested two different types of educational interventions. The first involved nurses teaching new parents about safe sleep practices for infants while still in the hospital. The the second intervention the mobile programme involved delivering information through e-mails, messages and videos.

Following recommended safe sleep practices can reduce the risk of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed; avoiding soft bedding that could strangle or suffocate infants; and using pacifiers, which has been shown to reduce SIDS risk.

“We’d been looking at the prevalence of safe sleep practices for a long time, and I had been getting really energised about doing a study that takes what we know about safe sleep prevalence and tests an intervention that might help improve the adherence to the ‘gold standard’ safe sleep practices,” said Eve Colson, Professor at Yale School of Medicine, Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US.

According to the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, mobile videos for educating new parents on safe infant sleep practices achieved rates of 92.5 per cent for back sleeping and 85.9 per cent for room-sharing without bed-sharing, two of the critical steps towards SUID reduction. These rates were much higher than those for the group who received only the in-hospital intervention on safe sleep practices.

In a clinical trial with 1,263 families, “mothers who received a mobile health intervention with regular text or email messages and videos reported statistically significantly higher rates of placing their infants supine to sleep compared with mothers who received control interventions”, the study said.

"But the Earth moves, and Rohith Vemula is a Dalit","Rohith Vemula’s mother, V Radhika, holds a picture of her son during a protest. (Source: Express Photo/File) Rohith Vemula’s mother, V Radhika, holds a picture of her son during a protest. (Source: Express Photo/File)

To the Vatican, the Earth did not move, to Galileo, it did. In less than half a millennium, truth triumphed as the earth continued with its business, as always, which is to revolve around the sun.

To the local district authorities, to citizens of Telugu country, to the Dalit masses, Rohith’s mother Radhika is a Dalit, her eldest child Nileema is a Dalit, the youngest child Raja is a Dalit, which means Rohith Vemula too ought to be a Dalit.

But after Rohith’s death, the ABVP declared Vemula was not a Dalit, so the RSS dittoed that declaration, as did a host of BJP leaders, and finally, the Union Government.

If anti-nationals are allowed to have their say in India today, why deny that privilege to the ABVP, RSS, BJP, the Union Government? So we should hear them out when they say that since Rohith was fathered by Mani, an OBC, hence he is a non-Dalit.

It’s pointless to argue with deadwood. Let me try, nevertheless. An adoptive girl, Radhika was married to Mani. The man believed Radhika belonged to his caste, Vaddera. After fathering three lovely kids, Mani figured out one day that his wife Radhika was a Mala, a Dalit caste. Almost instantly, Mani turns violent and abusive towards Radhika. In fact, he starts referring to her and behaving as if she’s an ‘untouchable’ — and I deliberately use that word — deploying the filthiest of casteist slurs.

Unable to withstand Mani’s casteist conduct that would often be associated with violence, Radhika along with her three children, returned to her mother, Anjani Devi’s home. The rest, of course, is history. Vemula and his two siblings grow up being doubly cursed by untouchability and poverty.

It indeed is a fine art to argue with people who don’t like to argue because they believe that their word is law; but of course, they are devoid of human sensibility.

Furthermore, a person’s dying declaration is taken as the pure truth. Rohith’s memorable memo to the world, not only to his family, notably speaks about the “fatal accident of my birth”. It is a dying declaration that is the loudest declaration of his Dalit universe that he always wanted to transcend. Only a person totally without any understanding of the sense and sensibility of the English language would miss the meaning; or they are trained pretenders of the truth.

Coming to the Judicial Inquiry headed by A K Roopanwal, a retired judge of the Allahabad High Court. Just look at the language employed by this Vatican enthusiast, appointed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The language matches word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph what the ABVP, RSS, BJP, and the central government have been saying since Vemula made the ultimate sacrifice in search of a just life.

The question is, why have the ruling BJP and the central government got so deeply entrenched in the Vemula case when they know that they are siding with the untruth? The likeliest reason is that the RSS has got involved in this case, embraced mud all over its persona. There is no way the central government will disobey the RSS which has been so badly battered in the Hyderabad University campus.

If the Vatican Church could hide behind the untruth for over 350 years, so can the Narendra Modi-led central government. The tragedy is that even in his death, they will not leave Rohith Vemula alone. For the Sangh Parivar, Vemula’s caste survives into the next life, and ever after. These are the mind games the RSS is playing with Dalits today.

"Wholesale grain market hit by confusion over GST, sales fall by 40 percent","Many retail traders are staying away from the Gultekdi wholesale market. Arul Horizon Many retail traders are staying away from the Gultekdi wholesale market. Arul Horizon

Over a MONTH after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into effect, the grains section of Gultekdi wholesale market has reported 40 per cent lower sales. This dip in sales, said traders, is due to the confusion about whether GST is applicable to branded and registered branded commodities, which has kept retail traders away from the wholesale market.

As per GST rules, the tax will not be applicable to packaged goods without a registered brand, but most retailers are wary of taking the risk. Brands which are officially registered will attract a 5 per cent GST.

Loose food grains have been exempted from the GST ambit, but the problem at wholesale markets is the ambiguity regarding the definition of a ‘brand’. Wholesalers usually pack loose grains in packets with generic names and sell them to the retailers. Majority of grains are sold in such packets, which has led to some confusion about whether GST is applicable to them.

On an average, about 225 vehicles carrying goods come to the Gultekdi market for trade, but of late only about 150 such vehicles visit the market.

Popatal Ostwal, president of the Poona Merchant’s Chamber, said several retailers were avoiding the market as they feared they would have to pay GST on the product. Most of the retail traders will have to make two declarations in a year under the GST composite scheme.

Ostwal said the Chamber has written to both the Centre and the state finance ministry, asking for clarity on the issue, but was yet to receive a response.

Ajit Sethiya, former president of the Poona Merchant’s Chamber and president of the Jaggery Merchants Association, said many retailers had stocked up on commodities, ahead of GST, and they were avoiding visiting the market. Given the lack of clarity, retailers have stopped purchasing from wholesalers and in some cases, wholesalers have stopped selling under brand names. While the government has allowed a two-month moratorium to file returns, retailers are wary about the tax burden.

Another fallout of the GST regime was an increase in the wholesale prices of most food grains, said Ostwal. “The per quintal price has increased by around Rs 300. Our experience is directly opposite to the claims made by the government… that food grains prices would go down post GST,” he said

"Bengaluru’s record rain brought largely man-made floods. Here is how, why","On Tuesday, in a low-lying area of Bengaluru. PTI photo On Tuesday, in a low-lying area of Bengaluru. PTI photo

Is it unusual for Bengaluru to go under in the way it did on August 15?

Like most of the country, Bengaluru receives the bulk of its rainfall in the monsoon months. Over the years, there have been many instances in which parts of the city have been inundated due to heavy rainfall, sometimes as much as 50 mm, in a very short time. On July 28 last year, a heavy overnight downpour dumped 51 mm of rain on the city, resulting in the flooding of many low-lying neighbourhoods, especially in the south and the east.

How much did it rain on Tuesday?

Between 3 am and 8 am on August 15, a thunderstorm accompanied by heavy rainfall struck the southern and eastern parts of the city.

The meteorological observatory at Bengaluru airport recorded rainfall of 128.7 mm during this time, the most in a single day in August in the last 127 years. On August 27, 1890, Bengaluru had recorded 162.1 mm of rainfall. The normal rainfall expected in Bengaluru on August 15 any year is only 5 mm. In fact, the city gets a total of between 130 mm and 140 mm of rain in the entire month of August. On Tuesday, therefore, the city got rain in a few hours what it usually gets in the entire month.

Is this what is called a ‘cloudburst’? What climatic/meteorological factors were in play over Bengaluru that caused this phenomenon?

Tuesday’s rain in Bengaluru, although a case of concentrated high rainfall, was not a ‘cloudburst’ event. A rainfall event is described as a case of cloudburst if a small area of about 10 km x 10 km receives rainfall in excess of 10 cm in an hour. Bengaluru received its 13 cm of rainfall over a five-hour period.

Weather scientists attributed the abnormal rainfall activity to an unusual simultaneous presence of four atmospheric systems. Three upper air cyclonic circulation systems were prevailing over different areas — one over the east central Arabian Sea and adjacent to the Maharashtra coast, the second over the coast of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring areas, and a third over southwest Bay of Bengal over north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh. Besides, there was also a crucial east to west shear zone along the 0.8 degree North latitude at a height of 5.8 km above mean sea level. The sudden downpour on Tuesday can be attributed to their combined impact.

But does this mean the city can do nothing in the face of nature?

Even small amounts of rain can inundate low-lying areas because the lake system that lay at the core of Bengaluru’s drainage has been virtually destroyed by encroachments as the city has grown exponentially. Earlier, lakes in the higher areas of the city would spill into the lakes in the lower areas, creating a natural storm water drainage system. Bengaluru, which had as many as 272 lakes in and around the city four decades ago, has only about 70 now, the rest having been swallowed by rampant real estate construction.

The government itself has reclaimed dozens of lakes to create bus stands, sports stadiums, housing complexes and for institutions like ISRO to set up facilities in the city. Real estate firms have been allotted land for residential complexes along lakeshores.

In July 2016, civic authorities faced public anger for failing to prevent encroachments of stormwater drains and lakes. The criticism forced the authorities to identify 1,000-odd properties around Bengaluru that had encroached on stormwater drains, but the five-day demolition drive triggered more anger — for it was the civic authorities themselves who had authorised much of the construction on the raja kaluves (stormwater drains) and lake beds.

Was Bengaluru the only place in south interior Karnataka that received heavy rainfall on Tuesday?

No. The southern district of Mandya experienced heavy rainfall (133.3 mm), Srirangapatna on the outskirts of Mysore received 110.1 mm, Ramanagara received 75 mm, and Kanakapura on the southern outskirts of Bengaluru got 67 mm of rain on Tuesday. Some flooding was reported in Mandya; the other regions, which are not densely populated, did not report flooding.

Is there a parallel between the situation in Bengaluru and the one that Mumbai faced in 2005, Uttarakhand in 2013 and Chennai in 2015?

No. Although a record for Bengaluru, Tuesday’s rain in the city was nowhere close to these other events. On July 26, 2005, Mumbai received as much as 944 mm of rain in 24 hours, an unprecedented event that claimed several hundred lives and completely paralysed the city. In 2013, some areas in Uttarakhand received torrential rain over three days in June — the worst affected areas saw over 300 mm of rain in that period, and thousands were killed. Chennai city received more than 300 mm of rain in a single day. The Bengaluru event pales in comparison.

"Video: PIZZA in CHAI!!!! Yes, someone actually tried that","The video shows the person swirling the pizza slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish. (Source: Just Pakistani Things/ Facebook) The video shows the person swirling the pizza slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish. (Source: Just Pakistani Things/ Facebook)

Now, we’re huge fans of food experimentation. After all, that’s how things evolve and we can expect new foods to pamper our taste buds. But there are some things that just should NOT be allowed. If the world was divided on the matter of pineapple as an acceptable topping on pizza – and this even had world leaders and A-list chefs weighing in (from Michelin chef Gordon Ramsay to Iceland’s president wanting to ban it totally, there is no end to this dispute) – then this next combination will make you shudder to your deepest core.

In fact, this could even start a World War III – over pizza, no less! Okay, we’re exaggerating a tiny bit, but pizza lovers from around the globe be warned, because once seen, you can not unsee it.

Just stating that we’ve warned you first.

A video is doing rounds on social media that shows someone DUNKING a slice of pizza in a cup of CHAI! Yes, you read it right… It’s blasphemous! It’s sacrilege! Yet, it did happen. The video further shows the person swirling the slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish.

The video was shared on a popular Facebook page known as Just Pakistani Things, and even the page admins warned the video is not for the faint-hearted, and we completely agree.

Watch the video here

Pakistani users have been freaking out since they saw the video and have been abusing the person, who ever decided to insult beloved pizza.

But this not first time, Pakistan went too overboard to make pizza desi. Earlier one pizza company in Karachi decided to launch Nihari pizza and fans went into a meltdown. Just look at with, served with ‘dhaniya patta and nimboo!’

Seriously, what were they thinking!

Another sacrilegious incident happened when a Bangladeshi pizza company decided to top their crust with Biryani! Thankfully it was only an April’s Fool Day prank and people found their peace.

"Govt alone cannot make a New India, change will be powered by every citizen: PM Modi","PM Narendra Modi PM Narendra Modi

Addressing over 200 start-up entrepreneurs in the capital on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government is taking steps to eradicate corruption that had become institutionalised and promised more measures to solve the issues faced by the people. “It is unfortunate that corruption had become institutionalised. Till you make a counter institutional arrangement, you cannot stop it,” Modi said at the ‘Champions of Change’ programme.

The prime minister said the government has already ended the systems of interviews for group III and IV employees in the government, ending the role of middlemen, who used to promise jobs for money. The event was organised by the Niti Aayog.

PM Modi said that as the middlemen are out of work now, they are the ones who are shouting the most about unemployment. Modi further said that only governments and their initiatives will not make a New India and that “change will be powered by each and every citizen of India”.

Urging young entrepreneurs to innovate and suggest solutions to deal with different issues, Modi said he would like Champions of Change event to be an annual feature. He said the different groups of entrepreneurs, which were set up to suggest policy initiatives, could be attached with the relevant ministries on a permanent basis.

The prime minister said his government has taken numerous measures, like introducing self-attestations of certificates and doing away with interviews for lower posts, to ease the life of the common man. Referring to the Padma awards, Modi said that in past the prestigious awards were given on ministers’ recommendation, but the government has now made it open to anyone for nomination.

“Remember how Padma Awards were given earlier? We brought in a ‘small’ change – people can recommend names for awards, unlike the past,” he said. Stressing that the government wants to work together with all citizens towards a New India, Modi said, “Every one of us is equally patriotic and wants India to scale new heights of progress. There is no difference in our love for the nation”.

German FA to refrain from collective fan sanctions,"Fans threw flares and fireworks at each other and torched banners and plastic seating. (Source: Reuters) Fans threw flares and fireworks at each other and torched banners and plastic seating. (Source: Reuters)

The German Football Association will no longer issue sanctions against clubs that affect fans collectively as it looks to open a dialogue with so-called ultra fan groups over stadium safety, the association said.

Germany, which has the world’s highest attendance per match in its Bundesliga, with 42,000 spectators per game, saw extensive crowd trouble on Sunday in Hertha Berlin’s victory at Hansa Rostock in the German Cup first round.

Fans threw flares and fireworks at each other and torched banners and plastic seating. The referee was forced to interrupt the game twice, including once for 15 minutes, as the game teetered on the brink of abandonment.

Last season, Borussia Dortmund’s 25,000-capacity south stand was closed for one match and the club forced to pay 100,000 euros as part of sanctions for fan trouble during a league match against RB Leipzig. Several other clubs have been given similar sanctions.

With the Bundesliga season starting in two days, the football association said its disciplinary body, which often issues sanctions against clubs that include closing a home stand or the entire stadium, will no longer impose such sanctions.

“We do not want for this period of time to issue sanctions such as blocking stands, exclusion of part of the stadium or complete `ghost matches'”, the football association’s chief president, Reinhard Grindel, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Grindel said a dialogue with fan groups has begun but so far ultras had yet to accept an invitation. “The fan representatives at those talks agreed to renew the invitation for the Ultras representatives,” Grindel said.

“We welcome that. We want to go jointly down a path which will lead to transparent and fair measures to protect the positive stadium experience.”

"Govt extends tax break for industry in north eastern, hilly states till 2027","New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo) New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo)

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved Rs 27,413 crore as Budgetary support for reimbursements for industrial units in northeastern and Himalayan states under Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime that used to earlier avail area-based central excise exemptions. The sunset clause under the scheme, which will benefit about 4,284 eligible industrial units in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and northeastern states, has been approved till March 31, 2027.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley, while briefing the reporters after the Cabinet decision, said that there is no provision for exemption under GST law and hence, this scheme for refunds has been approved. “The sunset clause has been extended till 2027 and within the GST Act, each industry will be entitled to the refund mechanism during this particular period (July 1, 2017-March 31, 2027),” Jaitley said.

Industries in the north eastern and Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand under the previous excise regime used to get 10-year exemption, he said, adding that there is a separate residuary period for every industry because of commencement of production and their consequent entitlement of a 10 year exemption. Under the new GST regime, there is no provision for exemption but there is one section under the Act which permits refunds, he said. “Therefore, refund would be permitted through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer),” Jaitley said.

Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) will notify the scheme, including detailed operational guidelines for implementation of the scheme within 6 weeks, an official release said. “Upon repeal of the central excise duty laws, the government has decided to pay a budgetary support equal to the Central share of the cash component of CGST and IGST paid by the affected eligible industrial units. The support shall be available for the residual period (ten years from the date of the commercial production) in the states of north eastern region and Himalayan states. DIPP will notify the scheme, including detailed operational guidelines for implementation of the scheme within 6 weeks,” the release said.

Before the implementation of GST regime, the Centre had allowed area-based excise duty exemptions for industrial units to incentivise production in less industrialised states of north east and J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Tax incentives were also granted by state governments under the industrial promotion schemes.

The area-based reimbursements are expected to be disbursed by the Centre from the 58 per cent share that will accrue from CGST and IGST collections under the GST regime. In October last year, after the GST Council’s approval to the reimbursement method for area-based exemptions, Jaitley had said that the decision regarding the number of exempted entities will be decided by states and the Centre.

States would have to decide on exempted entities as they will reimburse tax to them, he had said, adding that since the tax share will be shared between Centre and states in the ratio of 58 per cent to 42 per cent, respectively, the reimbursement for the area-based exemptions would also be in the same ratio.

“We (Centre) will reimburse only 58 per cent. How the remaining 42 per cent will be reimbursed that has to be worked out. I can’t get 58 per cent tax and reimburse 100 per cent,” he said.

North Korea maps out detailed plan for missile launches to sea off Guam,"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. (File/Photo) North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. (File/Photo)

North Korea offered a glimpse into its plans to fire missiles near Guam in photos released by its state media on Tuesday, as leader Kim Jong Un was briefed on the plans drawn up by the army amid heightened tensions with the United States. Kim was seen holding a baton and pointing at a map reading “Strategic Force’s Firing Strike Plan”, which showed a flight path for the missiles appearing to start from North Korea’s east coast, then flying over Japan and ending near Guam, as Pyongyang announced last week.

The launch location seen in the map appeared to be in the vicinity of Sinpo, the east coastal city that hosts North Korea’s submarine base, said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.

Kim said the location near Sinpo fits with what North Korea outlined last week – that four intermediate-range missiles will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi Prefectures of Japan, fly 3,356.7 km (2,085.8 miles) for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40 km (18 to 25 miles) from Guam.

“Every North Korean must have seen this photo on TV and newspapers. North Korea is showing its confidence, telling the United States: if they want to stop it they can try,” he said. “It also signals that the North has been studying this for a long time and getting ready to act if it decided to.” Tension on the Korean peninsula has risen over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, with North Korea and the United States exchanging a flurry of strong rhetoric, each threatening military action, in recent days.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned on Monday that the U.S. military would be prepared to intercept a missile fired by North Korea if it was headed to Guam, while the North’s leader Kim Jong Un alerted his army that it should always be fire-ready.

In 2013 when tensions ran high as North Korea threatened missile strikes on U.S. Pacific bases, including Guam and Hawaii, it also released photographs of Kim inside his military command centre signing the order to put rockets on standby to attack the U.S. mainland.

The pictures then showed a large chart titled “U.S. mainland strike plan” and it was seen targeting U.S. regions such as Hawaii, Washington D.C., and Texas.

North Korea has never carried out its threats to hit U.S. Pacific bases or mainland.

For the Guam briefing, Kim was seen acting as a commander in chief flanked by other army generals. Among the generals was Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist and one of the masterminds behind North Korea’s missile programme.

The briefing took place in a war room where other maps of operational zones in South Korea and Japan were hanging on a wall right behind the North’s leader. A black-and-white satellite imagery was seen on the left side of him.

Kim received the briefing on Monday when he inspected the command of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) Strategic Force, the North’s Korea Central News Agency said on Tuesday.

He was welcomed by scores of soldiers at the army command, showed photos released separately by state-owned Korean Central Television as well as its official Rodong Sinmun newspaper.

Kim, who praised the army for drawing up a “close and careful plan”, said he will watch the actions of the United States for a while longer before making a decision on whether to go ahead with missile launches toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, the report said.

I will be very excited to step on to the field as vice-captain of India: Rohit Sharma,"Rohit Sharma was part of the Test squad didn’t play in the three Tests. (Source: File) Rohit Sharma was part of the Test squad didn’t play in the three Tests. (Source: File)

Ten years after making his debut for the Indian cricket team, Rohit Sharma was finally in the leadership group when the opener was appointed the vice-captain for the five ODIs and only T20I against Sri Lanka. The right-hander was honoured to get the position and is looking forward to it.

“It’s an honour to be appointed vice-captain. Ten years ago, I was only thinking about playing for India. Being vice-captain now feels really good,” Rohit said at a press conference in Pallekele. Rohit didn’t play a single Test in the visitors’ 3-0 sweep of the hosts but was part of the squad.

“Whenever the opportunity comes, in the first one-day international on August 20, there will be some sort of role I have to play. I’m looking forward to it. Rather than thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment.”

Captaincy is nothing new to Rohit as he has successfully led the Mumbai Indians to three IPL titles in five years. He understands the difference between IPL and international cricket but asserts that the excitement and energy remain the same.

“IPL is a completely different ball game and international cricket is completely different,” he said. “But, yes, the excitement and energy remain the same, so nothing changes too much. In the IPL, I was captain, so I was more in front; here, I have to play a little behind-the-scenes role, but yes, I’ll be very excited to step on to the field as vice-captain of the Indian team.”

Rohit is yet to cement his Test spot and has been in and out of the playing XI. He was looking to make the no.6 position his own in the home season last year but an injury hurt his cause and he was ruled out for the remainder of the long home stretch. He did return for the Lanka tour but the management went ahead with Hardik Pandya.

“Nobody likes to sit out, but it all depends on the team dynamics, and what the captain and coach want, and you got to accept the fact and move forward,” Rohit said. “I kept working on my skills and tried to see where I can improve as a cricketer. You can’t sit here and waste time. All I was trying to do these past three-four weeks was to just improve my skills, see where things are going wrong, and try and strengthen the strengths I have talking to all the coaches there. They’ve been looking after us for a long time and they know what exactly has been going on with each individual. You always try to improve as a cricketer. It was great to watch everyone displaying their skills and winning 3-0 outside India. Great achievement.”

With Sri Lanka going heavy on spin, picking as many as five spinners in their ODI squad, Rohit gave extra importance to the sweep shot during the team’s training session on Wednesday.

“It’s something that the game demands these days, you’ve got to be innovative and play different kinds of shots to get maximum results,”Rohit said. “Like I said, you keep learning every day, so I have been trying to see what I can bring into my armoury. Every addition to your armoury is a good thing, and what better place than coming here and doing it. That’s what training sessions are for – to improve your skills and try and get better as a player.”

Rohit recalled his ten years in international cricket and said the time flew but made him experience various ups and downs. “It’s gone very fast, those 10 years. Of course, there have been ups and downs, but that’s how it is for any sportsman. That’s how it should be, you get to learn a lot more from ups and downs, it teaches you lot many things.

“Every day is a learning day. Today, I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse sweeps. That’s the opportunity I always wait for, to get on to the field and learn something. Initially, in limited-overs, I used to play too many shots at once. Now, I have realised it cannot be just about going out there and slogging every time, you’ve got to understand the situation and conditions. That is something I have learned these few years with the help of so many coaches around. I will continue to learn, you never stop learning. That’s the greatest part about this sport. There’s lot more to do and I look forward to it.”

Passengers sue Boeing for 2016 Emirates crash in Dubai,"The Emirates Boeing 777-300 flying from India crash-landed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in August last year. (PTI Photo) The Emirates Boeing 777-300 flying from India crash-landed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in August last year. (PTI Photo)

Passengers who were aboard an Emirates plane that crash-landed in August 2016 are suing Chicago-based Boeing for an alleged malfunction of the aircraft’s electronics. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court alleges the aircraft’s electronics system prevented the operation of a switch at a critical moment. More than a dozen passengers involved in the lawsuit claim the system didn’t provide any warning to the crew that the switch wasn’t working.

The Emirates Boeing 777-300 flying from India crash-landed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. All 300 people aboard survived, scrambling down emergency slides before flames destroyed the plane. A firefighter was killed battling the blaze.

UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority earlier this month determined there were no mechanical problems leading up to the incident.

A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuit, noting the litigation is pending.

Cabinet okays ministers’ panel for speeding up strategic sale of PSUs,"The CCEA chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved empowering the Core Group of Secretaries to take policy decisions The CCEA chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved empowering the Core Group of Secretaries to take policy decisions

For speeding up decisions relating to strategic sale in state-owned companies, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved setting up of an Alternative Mechanism consisting of the finance minister, Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Minister of Administrative Department. The ministers’ panel will decide on the matters relating to terms and conditions of the sale from the stage of inviting of Expression of Interests (Eols) till inviting of financial bid.

The CCEA chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved empowering the Core Group of Secretaries to take policy decisions with regard to procedural issues and to consider deviations as necessary from time to time for effective implementation of the Cabinet decisions. “The approval will help in speedy completion of strategic disinvestment transactions,” the government said in a statement.

The Centre plans strategic stake sale in companies including Scooters India Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd among others. In the Budget 2017-18, the government has estimated to generate Rs 15,000 crore from strategic sales, Rs 11,000 crore through listing of state-owned insurance companies and another Rs 46,500 crore from minority stake sales through new listings as well as already listed firms.

In the current year so far, the government has raised Rs 4,153.65 through divestment of strategic holdings and income from management of SUUTI investment, as per data from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). The government holds equity in companies including L&T, ITC and Axis Bank through Specified Undertaking of UTI or SUUTI.

The government has raised total disinvestment proceeds of Rs 8,427.59 crore as on August 3, the DIPAM data shows. Through a strategic disinvestment, the government can sell up to 50 per cent of its shareholding of a central public sector enterprise, along with transfer of management control.

While giving its in-principle approval for disinvestment of Air India in June, the CCEA announced constitution of somewhat similar Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism headed by Jaitley to look into five terms of references. The last strategic sale took place in Jessop and Co in 2003-04, when 72 per cent of government stake was sold to Indo Wagon Engineering for Rs 18.18 crore, as per data available with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

"Assam floods: We put her on a banana raft and pushed, thank God she is still alive, says victim","Lily Goswami, ailing, lies on a makeshift cot at Sonari-Kamakhya MV School in Assam, now a flood relief camp. Express photo by Dasarath Deka Lily Goswami, ailing, lies on a makeshift cot at Sonari-Kamakhya MV School in Assam, now a flood relief camp. Express photo by Dasarath Deka

When people of six to seven villages near Jakhalabandha, Assam, fled after the Brahmaputra broke 100 metres of its embankment at Hatimura, Gobinda Goswami, 62, and his family had a difficult task at hand.

His mother Lily Goswami, in her 80s, is bedridden. By the time he could go out in the dark and cut down three banana trunks to make a raft, the water in his house was waist-deep. “We put her on the raft with great difficulty and pushed it until we reached the road. I don’t remember who provided us a handcart to bring her to this relief camp. I thank God she is still alive,” said Goswami.

His mother has been lying on a makeshift cot made by joining two benches of Sonari-Kamakhya MV School, which has become a relief camp since August 12. “She cannot get up, even chew. We are giving her liquid food. She has become so weak that she can hardly speak,” said her daughter-in-law Bharati.

“We could not bring anything. My sister and I have lost all our books, and the certificates I had got in a singing competition,” said Pompi, 12, sitting beside her grandmother. She is in class VII at Hatbor Girls’ High School and her elder sister Bhagyashree in class X, with board exams due in February.

A medical team came to the camp for the first time Tuesday. The doctor wanted the elderly woman taken to a hospital in Tezpur, but her son refused. “I cannot manage, with not a rupee at hand,” said Gobinda Goswami, who used to sell vegetables.

Kalpana Gohain, who came from Dulal-Madhab village, worked as a midday meal cook at Madhab Middle School. “Our kutcha house was washed away in front our eyes,” she said. “My husband lost the small shed where he used to sell broiler chicken. All our papers were in a plastic bag hanging from a bamboo pole, but today my husband went and found our house itself has gone.”

Kalpana and others are helping the local Rainbow Youth Club prepare food for the camp. The club has arranged for two gas stoves, paper plates and plastic glasses. The district administration has provided rice and dal, while other sources too have helped.

On Tuesday, a group of teachers and students from Nowgong Girls’ College came with soap, sanitary napkins, baby food and other items, apart from rice, dal and salt. “We have cancelled our freshers’ union of August 17 and bought these items,” said Shanti Dey, general secretary of the students’ union. “The fund of Rs 35,000 for the event was sent on these items, faculty members contributed an equal amount, and the alumni association Rs 10,000 to make it about Rs 80,000,” said Amiya Patar, who teaches Assamese.

The school has only one toilet unit for 1,200 inmates; residents of Sonarigaon and adjoining Kamakhya village have let the people use their toilets and bathrooms. “After all they are our own people,” said Krishnaraj Hazarika, whose house is next to the school.

Around 9 pm, Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta, the local MLA, arrived and a dozen children gathered around him. “We have lost our books, schoolbags, uniforms. Will the government provide us with these?” said Labanya Roy Choudhury of class VI. “Will I be able to go back to school?” said Utpal Mahanta of class VIII. The women asked the minister how to rebuild their houses.

Kaliabor subdivision of Nagaon district has had no electricity since August 12 midnight. Fearing electrocution, the authorities have shut down supply indefinitely, and candles are the only source of light in this camp.

A Guwahati-based NGO had brought 600 eggs, which the 1,200 inmates shared.

"World Championships: One finalist, a disqualification, many also rans","Davinder Singh Kang made history by becoming the first Indian male to reach the final of the javelin throw at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters) Davinder Singh Kang made history by becoming the first Indian male to reach the final of the javelin throw at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters)

Historic final

Davinder Singh Kang (Javelin)

At London: 84.22 m (Qualification)

80.02 (Final — 12th place)

Season Best: 84.57

Personal Best: 84.57

Though he could not repeat the range he produced in qualifying, only being able to register a best throw of 80.02 metres in the final, Kang made history by becoming the first Indian male to reach the final of the javelin throw at the World Championships.

Languishing At The Bottom

Swapna Burman (Heptathlon)

At London: 5431 points (26th)

Season Best: 5942

Personal Best: 5942

The 20-year-old is one of the athletes who didn’t meet qualifying standards but was selected by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) after she won gold at the Asian Athletics Championships. Swapna, however, finished second last at the London Championships. The AFI justified Swapna’s selection by saying: ‘good performance at (sic) difficult conditions at a young age’.

Middling Performance

Thonakal Gopi (Marathon)

At London: 2 hrs 17:13

Season Best: 2:15:37

Personal Best: 2:15:25

Finished 28th in a field of 71 athletes who completed the 42.195 kilometre event but couldn’t improve on his season best.

Class Difference

Anu Rani (Javelin)

At London: 59.93m (did not reach final; 19th overall in qualifying)

Season Best: 61.86

Personal Best: 61.86

The 24-year-old failed to make the final and was 10th in her group. At the Federation Cup in Patiala in June, Anu registered her personal best, a sign that she has not stagnated. But on the big stage she came a cropper, symptomatic of Indian athletes who peak during the qualification period.

Need For Speed

Dutee Chand (100m)

At London: 12.07 seconds

(32nd in the heats)

Season Best: 11.30

Personal Best: 11.24

Chand’s 12.07 was below par even while accounting for the distraction of the reopening of the hyperandrogenism case and her relatively late invitation from the IAAF for filling up vacant slots after the Indian team was announced.

Star Eclipsed

Neeraj Chopra (Javelin)

At London: 82.26m (15th overall in qualifying)

Season Best: 85.63

Personal Best: 86.48

Since winning gold at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar, India’s brightest athletics star’s form has been on the wane. Both the AFI and the Sports Authority of India failed to ensure Chopra had a coach who could guide him after Garry Calvert – who trained the athlete when he won the World Junior gold – left for China earlier this year.

Running Out Of Steam

Monica Athare (Marathon)

At London: 2 hrs 49:54

Season Best: 2:39:08

Personal Best: 2:39:08

She was 10 minutes slower than her personal/season best which she set in in February. Came in at 64th in a field of 78.

A Hurdle Too High

Siddhanth Thingalaya (110m Hurdles)

At London: 13.64 sec (did not advance from the heats)

Season Best: 13.48

Personal Best: 13.48

Another example of an Indian athlete whose best performance came during the qualifying period but tapered off when it mattered most. He was seventh in his heat at 13.64. In all, 30 athletes were faster than him in qualifying.

One lap, A Huge Gap

Muhammed Anas (400m)

At London: 45.98 sec

(overall 30th in heats)

Season Best: 45.32

Personal Best: 45.32

Though he finished fourth in his heat, Anas didn’t advance as he wasn’t in the first three (automatic qualifying) in his race or the next six fastest across the first round of qualification.

"Key accused arrested, search on for 4 Nigerians in Pune","Following leads obtained during the investigation, police arrested Nigerian national Fortune from Pimple Gurav, and his alleged aides Usman and Mbaeze. (Picture for representational purpose) Following leads obtained during the investigation, police arrested Nigerian national Fortune from Pimple Gurav, and his alleged aides Usman and Mbaeze. (Picture for representational purpose)

The Cyber Crime Cell of the Pune City Police has arrested a Nigerian man who is allegedly the key accused in a racket to clone debit and credit cards. Police have identified the accused as Eremhen Smart (33), a resident of Supragiri College area in Bengaluru. Police have also arrested his alleged aide Irshad Sattar Solanki (28), a resident of Bandrekar Wadi in Jogeshwari, Mumbai.

Last month, police had arrested three Nigerian men — identified as Ogbehase Fortune, Bashar Dakin Gari Usman and Ifeanyi Mike Bbaeze — while investigating a case registered with the Khadki police station, in which Rs 67,000 was withdrawn from a person’s bank account without his knowledge. While some money was withdrawn from an ATM, the rest of the money was transferred to another bank account.

A team led by Inspector Manish Zende of the Cyber Crime Cell zeroed in on a person seen in the camera footage from the ATM kiosk. Police also got details of the account to which the money was transferred, and it was revealed that the account had been used to withdraw cash from other ATM kiosks. Following leads obtained during the investigation, police arrested Nigerian national Fortune from Pimple Gurav, and his alleged aides Usman and Mbaeze. Police also recovered eight cell phones, 20 debit cards and eight blocked cards that had been cloned, Internet dongles, pen drives and a laptop from the trio.

Soon, police launched a search for the key accused — Smart — who was found to be changing his locations frequently. On August 10, police laid a trap and arrested Smart in Bangalore. They recovered four cell phones, two laptops and Rs 1.65 lakh in cash from him.

On August 14, police arrested Smart’s “aide” Irshad Solanki, who allegedly helped him withdraw money from ATMs and “arranged” bank accounts, in which the money was transferred using cloned debit and credit cards. A court has remanded the duo to police custody till August 17.

Virginia city to hold memorial service for woman killed in violence,"Car attack victim Heather Heyer’s mother Susan Bro speaks at her memorial service inside the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. (Source: Reuters) Car attack victim Heather Heyer’s mother Susan Bro speaks at her memorial service inside the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. (Source: Reuters)

A 32-year-old woman killed when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville was to be remembered on Wednesday at a memorial service in this southern US college town. Heather Heyer was killed after hours of clashes on Saturday between white nationalists attending a “Unite the Right” gathering and counter-protesters.

Fall-out from the incident has become the biggest domestic challenge faced yet by President Donald Trump, who was assailed from across the political spectrum over his initial response blaming “many sides” for the unrest.

On Monday, the Republican president bowed to political pressure and denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan by name, but on Tuesday he inflamed tensions again by insisting that counter-protesters were also to blame.

Alvin Edwards, pastor of Charlottesville’s Mt Zion First African Baptist Church, was due to address the memorial for Heyer at the city’s historic Paramount Theater, which opened in 1931 and is located near the spot where she died. Her parents, Susan Diane Bro and Mark Heyer, asked people attending the service at 11 am ET (1500 GMT) to wear purple, her favorite color.

Residents of the usually quiet, liberal-leaning Virginia city were shocked by the weekend violence they said was brought by outsiders.

At a community meeting on Monday night, Edwards called on residents to continue to work to make Charlottesville a less appealing place for white supremacists to protest. “One of the things I want to make sure we do as a community and as a city is that we have to stand up and show the strength that we have in our community,” Edwards said, adding that he was

stunned to be facing Ku Klux Klan sympathizers more than a half-century after the height of the civil rights movement.

White nationalists called Saturday’s rally to protest plans to remove a statue of General Robert E Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army in the US Civil War.

Outside the Paramount Theater on Wednesday morning, artist Sam Welty was chalking a 7-1/2 foot (2.3 meter) high portrait of Heyer on a memorial wall nearby, where many tributes to the slain woman have been written. “The way she lost her life, doing what she did, really stood for Charlottesville. It makes me wish that I knew her,” Welty, 42, said as he worked on the portrait.

“It’s a shame that people who don’t live here had to come and unleash hate and violence and put Charlottesville on the world map for something that it does not deserve.”

James Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who is said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, has been charged with murder, malicious wounding and fleeing the scene. Nineteen other people were injured in the incident.

On her way to work at a Charlottesville insurance office, Stephanie Sherwood, 28, said she had always lived in the city, and had never seen anything like Saturday’s events. “I cannot believe that in 2017 we are still dealing with white supremacists and neo-Nazis,” she said, adding that Trump’s remarks on Tuesday made her very angry.

“He went off the rails yesterday, but I think he really showed who he is as a person,” Sherwood said.

"Rex Tillerson raps some US allies for religious freedom violations, slams IS","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (AP Photo/ File) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (AP Photo/ File)

US allies including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain did not uphold principles of religious freedom in 2016, while Islamic State has carried out “genocide” against religious minorities, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday. Tillerson made the comments at the State Department while introducing the agency’s annual report on religious freedom, required by a 1998 act of Congress. The report is the first to be released during the Trump administration and covers 2016.

Saudi Arabia, Tillerson said, ought to “embrace greater degrees of religious freedom for all of its citizens.” He cited criminal penalties for apostasy, atheism, blasphemy, and insulting the Saudi state’s interpretation of Islam, as well as attacks and discrimination targeting Shi’ite Muslims. The kingdom follows the strict Sunni Muslim Wahhabi school of Islam.

The report said Saudi Arabia has used counter-terrorism laws to target atheists and Shi’ite Muslims. The United States and Saudi Arabia have long been close partners in counter-terrorism efforts and the kingdom was the first stop on US President Donald Trump’s maiden international visit. Tillerson singled out another Gulf Arab state, Bahrain, saying it “must stop discriminating against the Shia communities.”

In Turkey, a NATO ally, “authorities continued to limit the human rights of members of some religious minority groups,” Tillerson said. American pastor Andrew Brunson has been jailed in Turkey since October on charges of being part of a terrorist organization, according to news reports. Tillerson said religious freedom is “under attack” in Pakistan, citing the marginalization of Ahmadiyya Muslims, a minority sect which Pakistan considers non-Muslim.

Tillerson said Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group that has controlled parts of Iraq and Syria, “is clearly responsible for genocide against Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in areas it controls or has controlled.” Tillerson said Iran targeted religious minorities including Baha’is and Christians, and in 2016 executed 20 people on charges including “waging war against God.” He also called out China and Sudan in his remarks.

The Chinese government tortures and imprisons thousands for practicing their religious beliefs, Tillerson said, citing the targeting of Falun Gong members, Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists. And in Sudan, the government arrests and intimidates clergy and blocks the construction of churches while tearing down existing ones, he said.

Tillerson’s decision to introduce the report contrasted with how he handled the State Department’s annual human rights report in March. He declined to unveil it in person, breaking with precedent, and drew criticism he was not giving rights issues adequate attention.

The report did not address Trump’s attempt this year to temporarily suspend refugee admissions and his decision to impose a lower cap on the number of those admissions. The report states that resettlement is a “vital tool for providing refugees protection.” Many refugees admitted to the United States in 2016 were fleeing religious intolerance and persecution, it said.

"China Vice Premier Wang Yang in Nepal, Doklam on agenda","Wang Yang is on a three-day visit to Nepal. Wang Yang is on a three-day visit to Nepal.

China Vice Premier Wang Yang, who arrived here on a three-day official visit heading a 21-member delegation, is likely to take Nepal into confidence on the Doklam issue, official sources said. Yang flew down to Nepal from Pakistan where he was the chief guest at the official celebrations of the 70th Independence Day.

Highly-placed sources said the Chinese side would take Nepal into confidence and it is expected that the country would maintain a neutral stance if the standoff between India and China escalates into a conflict.

Nepal’s Deputy Prime Minister and in-charge of foreign affairs K B Mahara had last week said that Nepal was in favour of the hostilities being resolved through dialogue and that it will remain neutral to the standoff.

Yang will meet Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, PM Sher Bahadur Deuba and other senior authorities during his visit. The Chinese Vice Premier will inaugurate the construction of the erstwhile nine-storey Royal Palace, which China had pledged to rebuild after it was devastated by the earthquake in April 2015, official sources said.

Chants on Sachin Tawar kept getting louder whenever the young sensation went for a raid. When he went in for a raid in the 11th minute of the first half, nobody had expected that he will return to help his side Gujarat Fortunegiants achieve a score of 12-3. It was a super raid that Telugu Titans could not come back from and ended up going down 19-29 in a one sided affair in the Arena by TransStadia in Ahmedabad.

While addressing the media, Gujarat coach Manpreet Singh said that just like any other team, they too have their own raiding machine. “Our team has been performing extremely well. I’m proud of my team’s performance at home. Before the match, I had told Sachin, Sukesh Hegde and Rohit that I want a Super 10 from one of you. And I’m glad that Sachin did it.”

Rakesh Kumar, Rohit Rana and Vishal Bhardwaj had no answer to Sachin’s brilliance and match-winning display of skills. When the referee blew the final whistle, Sachin, who has been giving back to back match winning performances, had scored 11 points from 15 raids. The young 18-year old has been the find of the season and Manpreet believes Sachin’s techniques are what is required at this platform. “His speed, techniques are very good and he is very clear of his targets,” Manpreet added.

With Sachin doing the most of the job, Fortunegiants captain Sukesh Hegde was able to lead and ensure that the defence remains strong. While Sachin took care of the raids for the Gujarat-based team, defenders managed to keep Titans star raider Rahul Chaudhari out of the mat. Suffering their seventh defeat of the season, Titans coach seems dejected with his defence. During the post match presser, he said, “Our defence is very weak and due to this we are not able to execute our plans. Also, it is disappointing to see that a player like Rakesh Kumar unable to guide the team.”

At every moment when the team scored a point, the dugout went wild along with the crowd. Manpreet Singh-coached side is now on a five match unbeaten streak and tops their Zone with 33 points.

Tamil Thalaivas, Haryana Steelers held to an exciting 25-25 draw

In an equally fought contest, debutants Haryana Steelers and Tamil Thalaivas settled for a 25-25 tie, which was the fourth this season. Strong defense from both the teams didn’t let the game slip from either of their hands. However, it was Surender Nada’s excellence in the left corner for the Steelers as he helped them come out from the jaws 0f defeat. The 27-year old Haryana captain scored his fourth High 5 of the season.

While Mohit Chhillar in the right corner struggled against the Tamil raiders, Nada balanced from the other side. In the fifth minute of the match, Surender took Ajay Thakur down with a strong double ankle hold which helped his side take a 6-5 lead. The first half of the match belonged to the defenders as the scorecard red 13-10 at the half way mark.

Both the coaches heaped praises for their defence while they were critical of their raiders for not doing the job for them. “Surender once again proved that he is the best raider of the world. Raiders made plenty of mistakes as the coordination was not upto the mark.If Vikas Khandola had clicked for us, we could have easily made it through,” said Ranbir Singh Khokhar.

But Tamil coach Bhaskaran believed that Ajay Thakur was over confident because of which he end up getting tackled easily. “There is no captaincy pressure, he was just over confident. After getting caught, Ajay began to think what will the coach and fellow players think about him, he was disturbed about that,” Bhaskaran said.

However, the second half belonged to the Tamil outfit. After Vineet’s raid helped Tamil Thalaivas to inflict the first all-out on Haryana Steelers and take a lead of three points. It was Amit Hooda’s late surge that sent Surender Nada out of the mat for the first time as Tamil took a one point lead. In the last two minutes of the game, first Ashish Chhokar made it 25-24 for Haryana before Dong Geon Lee leveled the match at 25-25 with a raid for Thalaivas.

"Bengaluru FC welcome Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with innovative signing announcement, watch video","Gurpreet Singh Sandhu signs for Bengaluru FC. (Source: Twitter) Gurpreet Singh Sandhu signs for Bengaluru FC. (Source: Twitter)

Talented Indian keeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has now signed for Indian Super League (ISL) Bengaluru FC from Norwegian side Stabaek FC for an undisclosed transfer amount. But the Blues did not just announce the big signing, they put up an innovative video to welcome the new member in their family.

The video starts with news of Bangalore on high alert, claiming that a mysterious creature in yellow is on the loose and has been recently spotted on various grounds. “It’s really big, it’s yellow. It’s like a human but it has really big hands,” says a boy on TV.

Guess who the city has been talking about – their new keeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club upload the video from their official Twitter handle saying, “We’ve got him!”

An excited Gurpreet, who became the first Indian player to be signed from a European club, said after signing a one-year contract with Bengaluru that he took up the offer despite having the option of playing for a top flight club in Europe. “I am extremely delighted to have signed for Bengaluru FC. While the experience of playing in Europe was fantastic, lack of game time was an important factor in making the decision of moving back to India. I had an offer from another top-flight club in Europe, but the need to play regularly ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in 2019 was something that was on my mind,” said Gurpreet who arrived in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

“The fact that Bengaluru FC was interested in me was encouraging considering what they have achieved over the last few years. With BFC playing on the continental level this season as well as the next one will provide the perfect platform for me,” he added.

The way back home: Will we ever be the India that was envisioned?,"The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it. The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it.

Reena Kallat Synapse, Single channel video projection, 2011

Studies say that the eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it and no two people see anything exactly alike. We create meaning through a mental bridge that the mind forms to complete gaps.

My video Synapse is an ironic play on legibility, where we witness 14 individuals’ attempts at reading the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist’s clinic. The traditional Snellen (eye chart), meant to measure visual acuity, in this case happens to have been replaced by a variation comprising the fragmented letters of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, which commences with “We the people of India…” Each person tries to make sense of the alphabets before them with hesitations and uncertainties, interrupted recurrently with change of lenses and monotonous questions regarding clarity of vision. Their pauses seem less about the limitations of their vision, and, instead, appear to metaphorically demonstrate an ordinary citizen’s blurred view of the most inclusive document of the nation.

Some of these ideas have preoccupied me for years and I’ve made several works that refer to the Preamble of the Constitution of India to examine our role as citizens vis-a-vis the republic. Through this video I made in 2011, I reflect upon our own limitations in understanding our responsibilities that come along with the freedom promised through the Constitution and how we choose to interpret it. Nearly 70 years after the fundamental principles of the Constitution were first laid down, we are far from having achieved these values. Fulfilling these can, perhaps, only be made possible if we collectively strive towards attaining them rather than allowing ourselves to be divided as a people, by being fooled into believing that these would be provided for.

Samit Das, Bibliography in Progress, 2016

History depends on archaeology and its excavation, on myths and archives. For a long time now, I have been looking at history not just as an unchangeable culture or a particular person’s assumption/ studies, but as a documentation of the growth process of society through a contemporary approach. History should be open for everyone to understand and interpret.

It is the same with art. One cannot be contemporary if one denies history. In the series ‘Bibliography in Progress’, I have looked at the Harappan civilization and I am working with images from the Constitution of India for another set. I attained a copy of the Illustrated Constitution published in 2000/2001, and am looking at the illustrations done by Nandalal Bose and his students. It is difficult to say if we are the India that our Constitution promised — there are various dimensions, and, something might be right according to one person and wrong according to other. All of these point to a multi-layered thought process intrinsic to a democracy.

Venkat Shyam, Freedom, acrylic on canvas, 2016

We have a long way to go before we become the India that was envisioned, where everyone is equal and enjoys liberty and justice. This particular work discusses gender equality and shows a woman walking hand-in-hand with a man. We speak of equality between men and women, but that is hardly a reality. A woman has to carry the burden of household responsibilities, despite whatever work she does outside her home. In this image, she has the globe inside her, representing the universe, but also a scorpion crawling on her, depicting her daily struggles.

LN Tallur, Eraser Pro, bronze, 2012

We are living in times when personal greed is overtaking the ideas that our society was built on. This erasure is, of course, incomplete, dependent as it is on the demands of that hour. For instance, we save things on the computer, but when we want to remove the data from the hard disk, maintaining privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first. The first thought is that when you “delete” the file, the data is gone. Not quite — it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk and can be retrieved. Similarly, we are aware of the values and principles that we have inherited, but are choosing to ignore them.

Riyas Komu, Fourth World, terracotta installation, 2017

The Lion Capital from the Buddhist tradition is one of the best images any nation can have to represent its diversity, multiculturalism and secularism. It represents the four dimensions that India as a country has always upheld, and that is something I have always enjoyed in the symbolism.

We are getting a feeling that this symbolism is crumbling. The four dimensions represent the “unity in diversity” that our Constitution enshrines. Though we do not see the fourth dimension, its presence is there, always unified with the other three and that was the strength of this republic. Conceptually, when this unity breaks, when we are no longer able to rely on the unseen fourth dimension, that’s when the anxieties of the State, and political and administrative processes surface. We’re excluded from these, making it easier for power structures to erase cultural differences and instill ideas of homogenisation in its citizens.

After I recovered, I went to the NCA to start working on my fitness and training. But the coaching staff doesn’t want to work with me at all, Akmal said and added, “When I asked why all those international coaches didn’t want to work with me, they responded that they wanted to prioritize working with players who had central contracts. I said that I too am an international Pakistan cricketer, and if my fitness is lacking – and I admit that along the way my fitness has been found wanting – they should help me.”

"I don’t like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.” ” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.”

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn’t like the word “diet”.

“I don’t like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,” Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: “I don’t recommend any diet”. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym — Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: “Pilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.”

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What’s the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

“I think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,” she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: “All my clients work extremely hard. It’s not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I’m proud of them.”

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: “I don’t believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.”

Iran can’t use nuclear deal to hold world hostage: US envoy Nikki Haley,"US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley (Source: AP Photo) US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley (Source: AP Photo)

US Ambassador Nikki Haley says Iran should not be allowed “to use the nuclear deal to hold the world hostage.”

Haley commented on Tuesday after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with the US and five other world powers could fall apart. Rouhani said Tehran could quickly ramp up and advance its nuclear program if the US continues “threats and sanctions” against Iran.

Haley warned that “the nuclear deal must not become ‘too big to fail.'” She added that “Iran, under no circumstances, can ever be allowed to have nuclear weapons.”

Haley said Iran must be held responsible for launching missiles, supporting terrorism, disregarding human rights and violating UN Security Council resolutions. She plans to visit the UN nuclear agency in Vienna next week.

"How do we run our homes, ask protesting Anganwadi workers","Outside CM Arvind Kejriwal’s house on Wednesday. Express photo by Amit Mehra Outside CM Arvind Kejriwal’s house on Wednesday. Express photo by Amit Mehra

On a hot Wednesday afternoon, 30-year-old Poonam wipes the sweat from her forehead and raises slogans even when her throat is hoarse. She, however, refuses to drink water. One of the anganwadi workers outside CM Arvind Kejriwal’s house on the 50th day of the protest, she says she has nowhere to relieve herself.

Anganwadi workers and helpers have been protesting outside Kejriwal’s house demanding an increase in honourarium, health insurance and pension after retirement among others. “Workers get Rs 5,000 per month and helpers get Rs 2,500 per month for working six days a week… How do we run our homes?” says 33-year-old worker Shashi from Dwarka Mod.

Apart from the commute cost — between Rs 50-Rs 150 — most complain about the lack of toilets. “We go to a park or behind a bus stop. It’s insulting… but what option do we have? The authorities don’t allow us a portable toilet… no one cares,” says Rajni (37), who reaches the protest venue from Shiv Vihar at 9 am and stays until 5 pm.

Anganwadis in the city fulfil a crucial gap in childcare, providing early childhood education and supplementary nutrition to children up to six years and nursing mothers. With the anganwadi strike on for the past 50 days, the centres are shut and children are at home.

On the 50th day of the protest — which fell on the same day as Kejriwal’s birthday — hundreds of workers and helpers sit on the road, laughing as a member of the Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union dresses up like the CM — complete with a muffler over the AAP topi, glasses and a painted mustache. A short skit takes potshots at the happenings inside the Vidhan Sabha, at Kejriwal and the central government.

For 35-year-old Ritu Rani, a worker from Trilokpuri, “the statements of the State and the Centre about women’s safety and respecting women are irritating…” “Are we not women? Where is the sympathy for us?”

A government spokesperson said, “The issues pertaining to increasing their monthly honourarium have been taken care of. But even though the file was sent to the L-G well before the announcement of the Bawana election, some officials and the L-G’s office sat on the file. Now model code of conduct is in place and the issue is stuck,” he said.

Officials added changes in insurance, pension etc, mandated a “change in the Act” which “needs to be done by the Centre”.

Charlottesville violence: Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal unveils resolution to censure Trump,"Charlottesville violence: U.S. President Donald Trump. Reuters photo Charlottesville violence: U.S. President Donald Trump. Reuters photo

Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and some other lawmakers have unveiled a congressional resolution to censure US President Donald Trump for his comments about the violent white nationalist rally in Virginia. “Not even a week has passed since the tragedy in Charlottesville. But on Tuesday, the president poured salt on the nation’s wounds by defending those who marched with white supremacists,” Jayapal said.

“In an unscripted press conference, we saw the real and unfiltered Donald Trump – the logical endpoint for a man who has consistently trafficked in racism throughout his career,” she said. The resolution which is also sponsored by Congressman Jerrold Nadler and Bonnie Watson Coleman would be introduced in the US House of Representatives on August 18.

“The American people expect their leaders to condemn white supremacy in unambiguous terms, Jaypal said. “President Trump not only failed at condemning white supremacists and neo-Nazis, he stood up for them – for that he must be censured. The president’s conduct is un-American and it must stop,” she said.

As many as 47 lawmakers led by Jayapal introduced a resolution urging Trump to strongly condemn white nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other hate groups responsible for the violence. It also urged Trump to remove all individuals from the White House and the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, who support white supremacists.

Meanwhile, Senators Mazie K Hirono and Maria Cantwell wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions urging him to create an interagency task force to address the tragic increase in hate crimes that has stricken the US. The recent outburst of violent racism and domestic terror activity by white supremacist organisations and individuals in Charlottesville, Virginia, has made the senators call for action even more urgent.

“President Trump’s reluctance to quickly and directly condemn the hate, bigotry, and racism of the white supremacists and members of the Ku Klux Klan that gathered in Charlottesville was deeply alarming to us and to millions of Americans,” the Senators wrote. “In light of the horrific attack and hatred demonstrated this weekend in Charlottesville, we urge you to act quickly to address the alarming rise of hate in our country,” they said.

‘Unite the Right’ march had been organised to protest against the proposed removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee, who commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Violence broke out after they were confronted by anti-racism groups and later a car ploughed into one group of anti-racism protesters.

Trump had blamed both sides including the “alt-left” for the deadly violence.

After exiting the ring, Corbin realized the amount of damage Mahal had absorbed and bolted back to the squared circle to cash in his Money in the Bank contract. The Lone Wolf handed the contract to the official, and the bell rang as soon as a staggered Mahal used the ropes to struggle back to his feet. However, Cena began to stir on the ring apron, so Corbin knocked him down with a firm punch to the face. The distraction allowed Mahal to sneak up behind The Lone Wolf and roll him up for the shocking pinfall.

In one of the most jaw-dropping moments in SmackDown LIVE history, Corbin’s Money in the Bank contract opportunity evaporated in mere seconds. Mahal heads to The Biggest Event of the Summer with his WWE Title in tow, while Corbin’s match with Cena this Sunday just got far more personal.

"Kevin Kisner licks PGA wounds, regroups for Wyndham Championship","Kevin Kisner was the last man standing with a chance to catch winner Justin Thomas at the PGA. (Source: USA Today Sports) Kevin Kisner was the last man standing with a chance to catch winner Justin Thomas at the PGA. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Kevin Kisner has had little time to wallow in disappointment after last week’s PGA Championship and will return to action at the Wyndham Championship on Thursday.

Kisner, who started the final round at Quail Hollow leading before finishing equal seventh, went home to South Carolina for three nights before arriving at Sedgefield Country Club late on Wednesday afternoon.

He will not even have time for a practice round, before teeing off on Thursday.

With a heavily-pregnant wife and a three-year-old daughter, Kisner, 33, said he has had little time to mope.

“The best part about having a family is they don’t really care,” he said.

“We’ve been hustling and bustling Monday and Tuesday at home to get everything done to get back up here.”

Kisner was the last man standing with a chance to catch winner Justin Thomas at the PGA.

“When we walked off the tee at 18 we asked the walking official what (Thomas) made on 18. We knew (then) we had to make (eagle) two to have a chance.”

That was no easy task on a 500-yard par-four, but Kisner went for it, despite having mud on his ball and knowing the odds of holing out were astronomical.

His five-iron, however, found the creek left of the green, leading to a double-bogey.

“It’s always great to be in the hunt,” he said. “You get to re-evaluate things you can do better next time you’re there.”

Kisner is now focused on this week’s event, formerly known as the Greater Greensboro Open, which dates back to 1938 and whose list of champions reads like a who’s who of golf, led by eight-time winner ‘Slammin’ Sammy Snead.

There will be no defending champion for the second year running, following Kim Si-woo’s withdrawal with a back problem, 12 months after 2015 winner Davis Love was also ruled out through injury.

World number nine Henrik Stenson heads the field, with the Swede needing to reach his 15-tournament PGA Tour minimum, having spent most of the summer playing in Europe.

Stenson has compiled some solid results lately, finishing equal 11th at the British Open and equal 13th at the PGA Championship.

“It hasn’t been great but hasn’t been poor,” he said of his form. “Lingering some where in-between, not hitting full form but still good enough to produce some decent scores.”

Stenson, 41, is already eyeing next year’s majors and is looking to add to the British Open he won in 2016.

“There’s another three majors out there and I’d love to win another one,” he said. “That’s my mind(set) for the back nine of my career.”

The Wyndham is a last chance saloon for many players, with only the top 125 on the FedExCup points list advancing to the playoffs that start next week.

Barcelona acknowledges interest in Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele,"Liverpool’s American owners are not wavering in their stance on Philippe Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team.

Barcelona is still after Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund forward Ousmane Dembele. Coutinho put in a transfer request last week, but Liverpool has said that he is not for sale after rejecting two offers for the Brazil international from Barcelona.

Dembele has been fined and suspended from team training by Dortmund, and is reportedly refused all contact with the club since Barcelona made a bid reported to be worth 105 million euros ($124 million), including add-ons.

“I recognize that they are two players that we really want to come, but their clubs are the ones who have to decide if we can make these signings”, Barcelona sporting director Robert Fernandez said Thursday.

Barcelona is trying to reinvest the 222 million euros ($262 million) it received from Paris Saint-Germain when the French club signed Brazil striker Neymar.

Liverpool’s American owners are not wavering in their stance on Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. “Nothing new,” Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said Thursday. “Nobody told me anything different.”

Coutinho will not be in the squad for Liverpool’s league match against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with the club saying he has a back injury.

So far, Barcelona has been limited to convincing Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande to part with Brazil midfielder Paulinho for 40 million euros ($47 million).

The 29-year-old Paulinho signed a four-year contract on Thursday, three days before Barcelona opens the Spanish league season against Real Betis.

Paulinho was considered a disappointment when he played for English club Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Guangzhou in 2015. He said at his presentation at Camp Nou that he had recovered his confidence in China.

“My first season in Tottenham was very good. In the second I couldn’t play consistently,” Paulinho said. “Perhaps it wasn’t my best season. Things didn’t go as I would have liked. But that is the past. I accepted the challenge of playing in China and I won back both my desire and confidence there.”

Paulinho will be tasked with strengthening a Barcelona midfield that took a step back last season, a decline that stopped it from defending its Spanish league title.

Voices of Partition: A Dhaka Hindu and a Kolkata Muslim recount what Independence meant to them,"Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo) Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo)

The Radcliffe Line cut through the heart of the subcontinent and was clearly the biggest cost of Independence. As the line cut through lives across India and the newly-created Pakistan, there emerged bone chilling accounts of deaths, violence and suffering from the North West and Eastern quarters of India.

However, there was a significant difference between the way Partition took place in Punjab and in Bengal. While the former represented a sudden cataclysmic division of territories, the latter was a long drawn slow process lasting even several years after independence.

Accordingly, the partition of Punjab was way bloodier than what its counterpart in the East witnessed. Though less dramatic, the partition of Bengal, however, was no less disturbing. Less about blood, the division of Bengal was more about displacement and the crisis of migration and property loss, that went on for the next several years.

An estimated 30 lakh Hindu refugees had entered West Bengal by 1960 as close to 7 lakh Muslims left for East Pakistan. The refugee influx in Bengal was also accompanied by the fact that the government was less prepared to rehabilitate them, resulting in huge housing and sanitation problems for the millions, most of whom were owners of large property back in East Bengal.

If the incoming Hindu population faced the bitterness of displacement on one hand, then the Muslims who stayed on in West Bengal were equally distraught. Overnight their homeland had turned unfamiliar with questions over their plans for leaving being raised too often as a reminder of their uneasy presence in India. While on one hand the political elite of the country unfurled the Tricolour, announcing to the world India’s achievement of freedom, what did independence mean to those in Bengal and Punjab, stuck in the aftermath of a line being drawn across their homeland? Here are two voices that help us get a sense of the insecurity and pain.

Basanti Roychowdhury: We never thought we would stay permanently

Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo) Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo)

“The word swadhin (independence) was something we barely understood. We just knew that Pakistan was getting formed and the Muslims would kill us,” says 85-year-old Basanti Roychowdhury as she reminisces over the days of horror she went through in her teens. A migrant from East Pakistan, Roychowdhury is currently residing with her son and his family in Kolkata. Daughter of a well-off zamindar in Dhaka (currently in Bangladesh), she recounts that for her, 1947 and the years preceding were all about the fear of Hindu-Muslim riots, her father’s hatred towards the nationalist leaders and the uncertainty about whether or not they would have to leave their palatial home.

“Our house was beside Buriganga river. It was a huge house. The surroundings were so beautiful. There was greenery all around. From the window in my bedroom, we could see paddy fields, all green around. There were barely any construction around. I could never imagine leaving Dhaka. My parents would come to Kolkata during vacations, but I hated going anywhere from Dhaka.

My father was a zamindar and we were more or less well off. The house was huge. I have been told you can still find it on Wikipedia. It was called Rooplal house.

When I was in my early teens one my brothers died out of typhoid. The grief of his death led to my mother falling very ill, and during this same time another brother of mine also caught typhoid. We were in fact planning on taking my brother and mother to Calcutta for his treatment. During this time, there were discussions of Pakistan being formed and a date being fixed. Everything was so uncertain, we were scared that we might have to leave our house. But my father was very hell bent that he won’t leave the house in Dhakha.

This was the time when Dhaka saw a large number of Hindu-Muslim riots. Ours was a Hindu locality so it was not that bad. But the Muslims would attack us frequently. We were very scared of Muslims and when they would attack. I have heard they had attacked our house once before I was born. This is why we had a large number of guards. I have heard that the Muslims had arrived at house in a bus, but before they could enter they had been pushed back. After that incident, they had never attacked the house.

I had once seen a large number of Muslims gathered on the other side of the river and crying slogans, about to attack us. I used to shiver with fear on hearing this cry. I was just 6-7 years old then and would start crying every time I heard them shout. The servants would pick me up and all my brothers would stand on guard on the stairs with guns in their hands.

On August 15, we were so scared all day because Pakistan was being formed. There was no happiness about anything at all. There was just fear. The Hindus were so scared as if we were getting finished now. There was no joy of the British leaving. There was just fear of Pakistan. Flag hoisting had taken place at night. I had seen the flag hoisted on my terrace on waking up. All the houses had flags hoisted. We had to hoist it, otherwise the government would suspect us of being anti-nationalist. We were very upset on seeing the flag. We were scared that we would be under the Muslims now.

My father was also very scared. Yet he did not want to leave. He felt that no one would know him in Calcutta. In Dhaka, he had the pride of being rich and well known and he did not want to leave that.

He used to hate Nehru and Gandhi. He was anyway pro-British, most zamindars were pro-British during those days. He used to hate all this rhetoric around the freedom struggle.

My elder brother on the other hand was very involved in the freedom struggle and was very anti-British. He was a student that time, doing his graduation in commerce. Alongside he would be secretly involved in nationalist politics. During that period, the younger generation was very stirred up to free the nation and my brother was also involved in it. He was arrested by the police once. My father had to somehow free him. My sister-in-law used to tell me that my brother used to get guns and arms and hide it under the bed. Generally the police would never suspect members of Zamindar families. But he was caught in a meeting once and got arrested.

We were in Dhaka during Partition and came to Calcutta in August 28 or 29. When we came here we never thought we were going to stay permanently. We had thought of going back after the treatment of my brother and mother. But once we came here people started pouring in heaps and bounds from East Bengal and so we decided to stay on.

When we first came to Calcutta, first of all there was the sadness of leaving our country. Then there was the grief of leaving that huge house and living in a small hut in Calcutta. The Calcutta house appeared like nothing more than a hut to us then. I missed the greenery of Dhaka and still miss it often.”

Dr. Hossainur Rahaman: Jinnah’s name could not be uttered in the house

Dr. Hossainur Rahaman (Express Photo) Dr. Hossainur Rahaman (Express Photo)

“Muslims are expected to fast each year during the month of Ramzaan, but I have fasted only once in my life and that was on the day of Partition. Such was my grief at Bengal being divided,” remembers 83-year-old Dr Hossainur Rahaman who has been residing in Park Circus in central Kolkata for the past several decades. A retired Professor of History from Chandannagar college and belonging to a family of “old school Congress supporters”, Rahaman recounts how his majority Hindu locality turned into a Muslim habitation overnight during Partition and how his father was pressed about leaving India soon after.

“Growing up, we were five sisters and four brothers. Now I am left with one sister. My eldest sister, Dr. Anwara Khatoon was the first female Muslim doctor to have passed out from Calcutta Medical College. She was quite a well known name in Calcutta.

As a young boy, I never joined politics. But I was well known as a follower of Nehru and Bose. My family was very much old school Congress supporters. In my school days I had a library in my home which I named “Netaji library” and had works of Gandhi and other Congress leaders in it. On the other hand, my father was in ardent opposition to Jinnah. I remember once my brother had gone to see Jinnah giving a speech and when he came home my father gave him a harsh scolding. He made it very clear to my brother that Jinnah’s name will never be uttered in the house.

The area in which I grew up, only 2 or 3 houses were occupied by Muslims. Rest all were Hindus. I was close to just one Muslim family. We were very friendly with the Hindus and did not for once feel that they were different from us in anyway.

On August 15, I was in Parbatipur in present day Bangladesh. I had no idea at that moment about whatever was happening at home. I came back home 2-3 days later. I reached Sealdah station and took a bus from there towards Ballygunj. The bus was absolutely empty. When I was about to get down at Park Circus people around me started screaming. “Jaben na, Jaben na, eita Muslim para (Dont go here, this is a Muslim area)” I was quite surprised but I got off and went home. When I reached home everyone was surprised that I came all alone. When I went out later to meet my friends I was shocked to see that everyone had left and suddenly this area had become a Muslim locality.

I was aware of the announcement of Partition but not about the riots. Once I came back home I became aware of what all had taken place. There was a temple at Kareya road right behind my house. My father got news that Muslims were about to destroy the temple. My father immediately took out his rifle and warned everyone that he would shoot down anyone who would try to touch the temple. Hindus had stayed at our house for a long time as well to hide from the riots. Hindus never attacked our house because my sister was a very important person in Calcutta that time.

I have a significant memory of a relief camp in Brabourne College. My sister was the only lady doctor there and I went with her there. I used to wait outside while she tended to the patients all day long.

After the riots, my father was asked over and again if we would leave. But he decided to stay on. Despite the fact that my sister was offered a job at Dhaka college and one of my brothers was offered a position in the post commission at Karachi, we never for once thought of leaving India.

"One million South Sudan refugees now in Uganda, United Nations says","UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi (L) and David Shearer, Special Representative for South Sudan. (Source: Reuters Image) UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi (L) and David Shearer, Special Representative for South Sudan. (Source: Reuters Image)

The number of South Sudanese refugees sheltering in Uganda has reached 1 million, the United Nations said on Thursday, a grim milestone for what has become the world’s fastest-growing refugee crisis. Ugandan officials say they are overwhelmed by the flow of people fleeing South Sudan’s civil war and the UN refugee agency urges the international community to donate more for humanitarian assistance. An average of 1,800 South Sudanese citizens have been arriving daily in Uganda over the past 12 months, the UNHCR said in a statement. Another one million or more South Sudanese are sheltering in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Congo and Central African Republic.

The number of people fleeing jumped after deadly fighting again erupted in South Sudan’s capital, Juba, in July 2016.

“Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,” the statement said.

“With refugees still arriving in their thousands, the amount of aid we are able to deliver is increasingly falling short.”

A fundraising summit hosted by Uganda in June raised only a fraction of the USD 2 billion that Ugandan officials have said is needed to sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.

Most of the refugees are women and children fleeing violence, often along ethnic lines, since the world’s newest country erupted into violence in December 2013.

Ugandan refugee officials have repeatedly warned the influx is straining the country’s ability to be generous to the refugees, who often are given small plots of land for building temporary shelters and planting crops when they arrive.

The largest of the settlements hosting refugees from South Sudan, Bidi Bidi, is roughly 230 square kilometres.

The World Food Program cut food rations for some refugees amid funding shortages in June.

The UN says at least USD 674 million is needed to support South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year, although only a fifth of that amount has been received.

The money is needed to provide basic services, including stocking clinics with medicines and putting up schools. Aid agencies say classroom sizes in the few available schools often exceed 200 pupils, and other children have dropped out because the nearest schools are located miles away.

“The funding shortfall in Uganda is now significantly impacting the abilities to deliver life-saving aid and key basic services,” the UNHCR statement said.

Fighting persists in parts of South Sudan despite multiple cease-fire agreements. Rebel forces said Tuesday they had reclaimed their stronghold of Pagak in the northeast, less than a week after being pushed out by government forces.

Both sides have committed serious rights violations, including murder and rape, against civilians, according to UN investigators.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger’s latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger’s agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa’s Shakuntala — a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‘husband,’ gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing – the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa’s story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves — how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen’s Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‘symbols, myths, magic.’ (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger’s favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‘rape,’ for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence — emotional, physical and sexual — against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‘misremembered’) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

Turkey asks Germany to extradite coup suspect- foreign minister,"“We sent a diplomatic note to Germany after the news regarding the presence in Germany of the FETO suspect Adil Oksuz, who is currently at large,” Cavusoglu told broadcaster TRT Haber in an interview. REUTERS/Umit Bektas “We sent a diplomatic note to Germany after the news regarding the presence in Germany of the FETO suspect Adil Oksuz, who is currently at large,” Cavusoglu told broadcaster TRT Haber in an interview. REUTERS/Umit Bektas

Turkey has asked Germany to extradite a theology lecturer suspected of playing a major role in last year’s failed coup, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday.

Turkey sent a diplomatic note requesting the extradition of Adil Oksuz, who the government says was the “imam” of air force personnel who last year bombed parliament as part of the attempt to topple the government.

Authorities say Oksuz was detained near an Ankara air base hours after the coup attempt, only to be released by a judge two days later and has been on the run since. Turkish media have reported that he has been spotted in Frankfurt and Ulm and given a temporary residence permit by Germany’s Baden-Wurttemberg state. “We sent a diplomatic note to Germany after the news regarding the presence in Germany of the FETO suspect Adil Oksuz, who is currently at large,” Cavusoglu told broadcaster TRT Haber in an interview.

FETO is the government’s label for supporters of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen who authorities say was behind the coup attempt. Video footage released after the coup attempt showed Oksuz and businessman Kemal Batmaz, another alleged ringleader in the coup attempt, arriving at Istanbul’s main airport two days before the attempted putsch.

Authorities say the men were returning from a visit to the United States where they allegedly met Gulen. The cleric, who denies involvement in the attempted putsch and has condemned it, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

Batmaz remains in detention after his arrest in the immediate aftermath of the failed coup.

More than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000 have been suspended in the crackdown that following the attempt. Journalists and opposition figures have also been targeted.

The scale of the crackdown has strained ties with some of Turkey’s allies, such as Germany, which have voiced concern that President Tayyip Erdogan may be using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.

Ankara says such measures are justified by the threat to democracy now posed by Gulen, a former Erdogan supporter. More than 240 people were killed in the coup, most of them civilians. (Reporting by Ece Toksabay and Dirimcan Barut; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Dominic Evans)

New-age patriotic Bollywood movies,"As India celebrates 70 years of Independence today, indianexpress.com brings to you a list of new age Bollywood movies that not only offer a fresh take on patriotism but also make you feel proud of the sacrifices that the leaders of the country made during the freedom struggle. What better way to reminisce those fond memories than binge-watching these movies.

Rang De Basanti



This 2006 Aamir Khan film shed light on the struggles of our nation's freedom fighters through a different lens. The plot revolved around a British filmmaker inviting five young post-independence men to star in her film. The movie also connects India's struggle for freedom to the present day's scenario of corruption when one of the boys' friend dies in a fighter plane crash.

Mangal Pandey: The Rising



Released in 2005, this Aamir Khan film tells the poignant tale of Mangal Pandey, the sepoy who started the popular mutiny of 1857.

Gadar: Ek Prem Katha



This 2001 action drama starring Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel and Amrish Puri, was set in the time of the Partition of India in 1947. The beautiful love-story between a Sikh truck-driver and a Muslim girl fleeing to Pakistan was appreciated by fans and critics alike, especially because it was testimony to the fact that love can blossom even in an atmosphere of hatred.

Swades: Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker weaved magic with this 2004 film. The lead character Mohan, who works at NASA, realises the lack of basic facilities in a small Uttar Pradesh village named Charanpur and he decides to build a hydroelectric plant there. It also portrays the feeling of belonging to one's nation through Mohan deciding to shift his job from the US to India.

Lagaan



Another Aamir Khan gem, this 2001 release was set in the Pre-Independence era and remarkably portrayed how a cricket match became a metaphor for the entire Independence struggle. The plot revolves around a match played by a team of hard-working village men who are promised an end to high taxes (Lagaan) if they win. The film was a commercial and critical success and even went on to be nominated for the Oscars in the Best Foreign Film category.

Sarfarosh



Released at the time of Kargil War, this 1999 film is about an Indian police officer's quest to stop cross-border terrorism. Written and directed by John Matthew Matthan, Sarfarosh starred Aamir Khan, Naseeruddin Shah and Sonali Bendre among others.

Border



J.P. Dutta's 1997 outing was based on the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Starring an ensemble cast of Sunny Deol, Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Khanna and Jackie Shroff in pivotal roles, the film depicted the hardships faced by soldiers placed at the L.O.C."

Juan Martin del Potro advanced to the second round of the Western & Southern Open with a 3-6, 7-6 (1), 6-0 upset of 10th-seeded Tomas Berdych on Tuesday.

The 30th-ranked del Potro shook off a first-set loss, jumping out to a 4-1 lead in the second set before settling for a win in the tiebreak, which he led 5-0 and clinched with an ace. He built on his momentum by rolling through the third set against the Wimbledon semifinalist, improving to 12-0 in first-round matches this season.

Berdych was playing his first match since withdrawing from last week’s Rogers Cup in Montreal with a rib injury.

Ninth-seeded David Goffin became the first seeded man to be knocked out in Cincinnati, falling to Nick Kyrgios, 6-2, 6-3 in a first-round match. Kyrgios will meet qualifier Alexandr Dolgopolov in the second round after Dolgopolov defeated Kevin Anderson 6-4, 7-6 (6).

In women’s first-round action, Karen Khachanov beat Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 1-6, 6-3, and Ashleigh Barty beat Varvara Lepchenko, 6-4, 6-4 in a matchup of two qualifiers.

Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez said on Wednesday he was delighted to have signed striker Joselu from Premier League rivals Stoke City.

The former Spain Under-21 international, who has also played at Real Madrid, Celta Vigo and Hoffenheim, has signed a three-year deal, with local media reporting the transfer fee at around 5 million pounds ($6.44 million).

Joselu scored four goals in 27 league appearances for Stoke before going on loan to Deportivo La Coruna last season. “We have known Joselu since his days at the Real Madrid academy, and we know that he has the potential to do well for us,” Benitez said in a statement.

“Obviously he has experience of English football and the Premier League and that was another thing we took into consideration. We think if we can exploit his full potential he will be a good signing for us.”

Joselu joins a host of other close season signings at Newcastle, including Christian Atsu, Florian Lejeune, Jacob Murphy, Javier Manquillo and Mikel Merino.

Air quality in Delhi this August worse than that of last year: CPCB,"Delhi and surrounding areas see the best air quality in the months of July and August because of the rain. Delhi and surrounding areas see the best air quality in the months of July and August because of the rain.

Delhi’s air quality has suffered more in the first two weeks of August as compared to the same time last year, data collated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows. Moreover, Delhi is the second most polluted city among the neighbouring ones including Gurgaon, Faridabad, Agra and Ghaziabad.

However, Ghaziabad, where air quality monitoring was started only this year, is the most polluted with an average air quality of 126.7 as compared to Delhi’s 112.

Delhi and surrounding areas see the best air quality in the months of July and August because of the rain.

According to a report prepared by CPCB in March last year, the cities of Varanasi and Faridabad are the most polluted in winters, with the air quality index regularly showing the severely polluted warning sign. Delhi is at number three, as per the report.

In monsoon months, however, the pollution in these cities goes down considerably. Delhi, though, still sees higher pollution as compared to the others.

Rainfall has the capability to dissolve several pollutants and wash away particulate matter and dust and that is one of the reasons behind lower air pollution levels.

Higher pollution levels

A comparison of CPCB data from August this year and August last year in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Agra shows that while pollution levels have increased in the first three cities, Agra is the only one that has managed to buck the trend.

In 2016, Gurgaon was the least polluted with an average AQI of 54.1. It has grown to 63.5 between August 1 and August 15 this year. Agra, in 2016, recorded an average AQI of 79.5. This time, however, the value is 56.6.

Delhi and Ghaziabad did not see a single good air quality day (where AQI value is below or equal to 50) in the 15 days. Agra saw six such days, Gurgaon saw two and Faridabad one.

According to officials at CPCB, Delhi’s pollution levels could be a result of two things — thick concentration of vehicles and better air quality monitoring.

“Emission from vehicles is not washed away very easily by rains. And in a high-density area like Delhi there are very few areas that act as a sink for air pollution. Also, the quality and network of air quality monitoring is much better in Delhi as compared to in other areas. Most of these places only have one or two stations. In Delhi, there are around 20 stations managed by different agencies,” said a senior official. The emergence of Ghaziabad as a high-pollution zone does not surprise experts.

“Small industries , many of them illegal, and brick kilns, generate a lot of pollutants in the area. Construction dust is also a major factor,” said the CPCB official.

"China urges US, North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on threatening each other","China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer. China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer.

China has urged the United States and North Korea to “hit the brakes” on threatening words and work toward a peaceful resolution of their tense standoff created by Pyongyang’s recent missile tests and threats to fire them toward Guam. The dispute has also raised fears in South Korea, where a conservative political party today called for the United States to bring back tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula.

In a sign of growing concern on the part of Pyongyang’s only major ally, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to “stir up an incident on their doorstep,” according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.

“The most important task at hand is for the US and North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an ‘August crisis,'” Wang was quoted as saying in yesterday’s conversation.

The ministry quoted Lavrov as saying tensions could rise again with the US and South Korea set to launch large-scale military exercises on August 21.

“A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula’s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods,” Lavrov was quoted as saying.

China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer, although relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated amid the North’s continuing defiance of China’s calls for restraint.

In recent months, China has joined with Russia in calling for the US to suspend annual military drills with South Korea in exchange for Pyongyang halting its missile and nuclear tests as a first step toward direct talks.

Today, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, continued a visit to China following talks the day before with his Chinese counterpart that touched on North Korea

Neethanae, the second single from Ilayathalapathy Vijay’s upcoming film Mersal, was released on Thursday. Oscar-award winning musician AR Rahman has composed and sung the romantic number with Shreya Ghoshal.

It’s worth mentioning that Rahman has crooned for Vijay after a gap of 10 years. Vijay’s last film that had Rahman’s music was Azhagiya Tamil Magan that came out in 2007. Lyricists Vivek has penned Neethanae.

The song was a sort of tribute to the victory of jallikattu protests in Tamil Nadu that made international headlines. The second song is a duet between Vijay and Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The makers earlier in the day had even released a 30-second teaser of the song.

The filmmakers are gearing up for a grand audio release function that will take place in Chennai on August 20. The event will also mark Rahman’s 25 glorious years in the world of music. Rahman made his debut as a music director with filmmaker Mani Ratnam’s classic Roja, which released on August 15 in 1992. Buzz is that he will perform live at the event to celebrate the milestone in his career.

Mersal is one of the most-awaited films down south this year. It is also the most-expensive film in Vijay’s career. He plays three different roles in the movies, including a villager and magician. While the third role is still kept under wraps.

While Nithya Menon, Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha play the female leads, SJ Suryah, Sathyaraj, Kovai Sarala and Vadivelu among others will be seen in pivotal roles. The film directed by Atlee is bankrolled by Sri Thenandal Films.

Saradha Scam: PMO refers Trinamool MP’s petition to CVC,"In his petition, dated 7.6.2017, Ghosh alleged tampering of evidence in the Saradha scam case by police officers including Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar — the then head of SIT (Commissioner of Bidhannagar). (File Photo) In his petition, dated 7.6.2017, Ghosh alleged tampering of evidence in the Saradha scam case by police officers including Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar — the then head of SIT (Commissioner of Bidhannagar). (File Photo)

Following a petition from suspended Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh, which alleged “tampering of evidence” by top police officers in the Saradha scam case, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has referred the matter to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

In his petition, dated 7.6.2017, Ghosh alleged tampering of evidence in the Saradha scam case by police officers including Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar — the then head of SIT (Commissioner of Bidhannagar). He had also named Director General of Police Surajit Kar Purkayastha, who was then the IG (Law and Order), for allegedly attending a meeting of agents from the Saradha Group of Companies.

When contacted, Purkayastha said: “I have no idea about this.” According to official communication dated August 2, undersigned by the undersecretary, government of India, S P R Tripathi (a copy of which is with The Indian Express), Ghosh’s petition has been forwarded to the CVC for “appropriate action”.

“I have received a copy of the order,” Ghosh told The Indian Express. The Saradha ponzi scam broke out in 2013, when the umbrella group of around 200 companies failed to pay its investors.

"Maharashtra’s new Rs 1,300 crore plan to make roads pothole-free","Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period. Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period.

UNVEILING a new plan to fix the persistent problem of potholes across state roads, the Maharashtra government is now aiming to improve road surfaces permanently, moving away from the reactive system of pothole repairs.

While the state Public Works Department (PWD) spends crores of rupees every year to repair potholes, most resurface soon after. To resolve this problem, the government has now decided to award annual maintenance contracts for 50,000 kilometres of roads in the state.

“This is a complete shift from the sporadic repair contracts that were being awarded previously. It will enhance accountability and ensure road quality throughout the year,” said Ashish Kumar Singh, Principal Secretary, Public Works Department.

Singh said that his department had already floated tenders to award the maintenance contracts.

Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period.

According to the government’s estimates, the contract would cost Rs 1,300 crore in all. But it is banking on handsome savings on the recurrent expenditure on pothole repairs, besides the economic benefits from a more dependable road infrastructure network.

For more accountability in the repair work, the government has imposed a condition that those who are awarded the maintenance contracts would have to compulsorily use mechanised methods to fix bad patches. Contractors will also be required to upload real time photos of potholes and bad patches being repaired.

Senior sources said that the earlier practice had been to award repair contracts for individual bad patches, which made monitoring the repair work challenging.

Under the new plan, the number of contracts will be fewer, making the monitoring process more manageable, one of them added.

The whole idea is to make roads pothole-free and more durable, said another.

Meanwhile, the department is in the process of awarding construction of another 10,000 kilometre of roads, totalling Rs 30,000 crore, under the hybrid annuity model.

The department has proposed to pay 40 per cent of the cost of such contracts in biannual instalments within two years of completion of the work, while the remaining payments would be made in phases over 15 years.

"NY Times editor testifies in Sarah Palin defamation case, says they did not apologise to her","James Bennet, editorial page editor of The New York Times, leaves federal court on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017, in New York. (Source: AP Photo) James Bennet, editorial page editor of The New York Times, leaves federal court on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017, in New York. (Source: AP Photo)

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin’s lawyer seemed to be fishing for an apology as he grilled an editorial page editor at The New York Times in a federal courtroom on Wednesday. Attorney Kenneth Turkel questioned Times editorial page editor James Bennet over his role in the creation of a June editorial about gun control after a shooter opened fire on Republican lawmakers in Virginia, wounding US Rep. Steve Scalise.

The editorial, titled “America’s Lethal Politics,” was corrected twice after some readers complained that it appeared to blame a political action committee belonging to Palin, a former Republican vice presidential candidate, for “political incitement” before the 2011 shooting of then-Arizona US Rep. Gabby Giffords.

Turkel noted that the Times never mentioned Palin, who was not in court Wednesday, by name in its online corrections or in a statement Bennet issued after the editorial was published. “Did you apologize to her?” the lawyer asked Bennet.

“We did not apologize to her,” Bennet responded at a Manhattan hearing called by US District Judge Jed Rakoff to help him decide by the end of August whether the lawsuit can proceed to a stage that would let Palin’s lawyers obtain emails and other potential evidence from the Times.

The subject of an apology has arisen before. In her lawsuit, Palin’s lawyers complained that the newspaper had “an unwavering refusal to issue a meaningful apology to Mrs. Palin.” The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, also said the Times failed to “issue a public apology to Mrs. Palin for stating that she incited murder.”

In court papers, the Times said the editorial “does not attribute any conduct to Mrs. Palin.” The piece originally accused a Palin political action committee of distributing a map depicting Democratic lawmakers beneath crosshairs.

Read | Sarah Palin sues New York Times for tying her PAC ad to mass shooting

Later, the newspaper issued a correction noting that the map actually showed electoral districts, not people, in crosshairs. The Times also said in the June 16 correction that the editorial “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting.”

During testimony, Bennet cited deadline pressures as he explained that he did not personally research the information about Palin’s political action committee before approving the editorial’s publication. He said he believed the editorial was accurate when it was published. He said he began working on correcting the editorial at 5 a.m. the following day after reading complaints from readers. “We were scrambling, I will say, a little bit,” Bennet said. “I was doing 10 other things that day.”

Turkel attempted to discredit Bennet, suggesting that he might have been influenced by the fact that Palin last year had endorsed an opponent of his brother, US Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat.

India ahead of China on Retail Development Index in first half of FY17,"Seven new global brands entered the country during the first half of 2017 and investments into the segment touched USD 200 million. (Representational) Seven new global brands entered the country during the first half of 2017 and investments into the segment touched USD 200 million. (Representational)

India has surpassed China in the global Retail Development Index in 2017, indicating growing prominence of the country as a preferred retail destination for global brands, says a report by real estate consulting firm CBRE South Asia.

Seven new global brands entered the country during the first half of 2017 and investments into the segment touched USD 200 million, said the India Retail Market View Report. Besides, it added, international brands already present in the country also expanded their presence.

Several hypermarkets, including Big Bazaar which opened new stores in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, expanded their presence, it said, adding that clothing retailers such as Max and Pantaloons were also active during the review period. “Our ranking on the 2017 Global Retail Index for developing countries, as well as continued investment by private equity players, is a demonstration of the sustained preference of international brands to set up, or expand their operations in India,” CBRE Chairman, India and South East Asia Anshuman Magazine said.

The brands which opened their first store in India during the first half of 2017 include Kate Spade, Scotch & Soda, Pandora and Selected Homme while those who expanded operations were H&M, Jack & Jones, US Polo, Taco Bell and Forever 21, among others.

In terms of rental for the retail space, areas such as Connaught Place, Khan Market, and South Extension in the Capital and Park Street and Elgin Road in Kolkata witnessed appreciation. While rentals in most other high streets remained stable, some high streets such as Linking Road in Mumbai and MG Road in Pune saw a marginal dip in rentals.

Taiwan says Chinese aircraft conduct more drills near island,"China conducted air exercises near Taiwan over the weekend , the latest in a series of such exercises near Taiwan and Japan in the past several weeks. (AP/File) China conducted air exercises near Taiwan over the weekend , the latest in a series of such exercises near Taiwan and Japan in the past several weeks. (AP/File)

Chinese military aircraft conducted a third day of training near Taiwan on Monday after doing close flybys of the island over the weekend, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense said. Two Chinese military transport aircraft flew through the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, then took different courses before returning to base, the ministry said.

China has been increasingly asserting itself in territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. It is also worried about Taiwan, which it claims as its own, but which is run by a government China fears is intent on independence. Taiwan’s military closely monitored the Chinese aircraft and the situation was under control, the ministry said.

“Our military has monitored the movements of the Chinese aircraft from the beginning to the end and were prepared for any contingency based on our rules of engagement,” it said in a statement. After the two aircraft flew through the Bashi Channel, one took a northeasterly direction and passed over waters near Japan’s Miyako island to Taiwan’s north before returning to its base, the ministry said.

The other flew in a southeasterly direction before it too returned to base the way it had come. China’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the past three days of drills.

China conducted air exercises near Taiwan over the weekend , the latest in a series of such exercises near Taiwan and Japan in the past several weeks. China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be a renegade province, and has never ruled out the option to regain control of the island by force if necessary.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old — who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made — will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‘Descent’ in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

“There is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,” Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, “Beauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.”

"Bangladesh: JMB militant planning to attack Dhaka rally killed, says police","Fire seen following a blast as Bangladeshi policemen try to flush out suspected Islamist radicals who have holed up in a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo) Fire seen following a blast as Bangladeshi policemen try to flush out suspected Islamist radicals who have holed up in a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo)

An Islamist militant was killed in a suicide blast during a counter-terror raid at a Dhaka hotel as he was plotting to attack a rally taken out to pay homage to Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, police said today. The police said Saiful Islam, an operative of the outlawed Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) group, was under surveillance for the past two days and was killed in operation ‘August Bite’.

The elite SWAT team shot the militant when he triggered to blow the the door of his hotel room and tried to trigger another bomb, police chief AKM Shahidul Haque told reporters. “He attempted to trigger a second bomb prompting police to fire shots as he also set off his suicide vest,” he said. Witnesses said that up to a kilometre of road was blocked for the anti-terror operation.

Another official familiar with the development said the police had kept a vigil on the militant following a tip-off he was planning to attack a rally on the National Mourning Day.

On August 15, thousands of people take out a procession in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of the assassination of the ‘Bangabandhu’, who was killed along with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. His daughter and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina survived as she was touring abroad. Black flags dominated the skyline in Dhaka today.

Hasina’s government blames the JMB for a number of deadly attacks in Bangladesh. Several foreigners, bloggers and rights activists have been targeted by the group in recent years. In one of the deadliest attack in Bangladesh, five gunmen stormed an upscale cafe in Dhaka in July last year and killed 22 people, 18 of them were foreigners.

The Islamic State claimed the brutal attack but the government has insisted the group has no base in the country and the attacks were carried out by homegrown militant groups like the JMB.

"Gylfi Sigurdsson move can fund future Swansea transfers, says Paul Clement","Everton says it has signed Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea for a club-record fee, further strengthening the team’s attacking options to compensate for the departure of striker Romelu Lukaku. (Source: AP) Everton says it has signed Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea for a club-record fee, further strengthening the team’s attacking options to compensate for the departure of striker Romelu Lukaku. (Source: AP)

Swansea City can use the funds generated from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s move to Premier League rivals Everton to sign two or three more players, manager Paul Clement said ahead of Saturday’s home game against Manchester United.

Iceland midfielder Sigurdsson, who played a key part in the Welsh club avoiding relegation last season, completed his move to Everton on Wednesday with British media reporting the fee to be around 45 million pounds ($57.96 million).

“I spoke to them (chairman and owners) last night about what we will do moving forward. Funds are available to strengthen the squad,” Clement told reporters on Thursday.

“It’s a big challenge, no question. We hope we can potentially bring in two or three players to strengthen us in various positions.”

Swansea have been linked with multiple players as they look to avoid another relegation scrap and Clement says that the club are keen to bolster the squad quickly but will not pay massive fees.

“We have multiple targets because things do not always come off, you have to move to other players in that situation,” he said. “We have to move swiftly, time is important but we will not panic. Sometimes the deals can be better in the last days.

“We have to make sure any player we bring in comes at the valuation we want, we will not pay over the odds. We have cast the net wide… you have to look far and wide for good value.”

Swansea were held to a goalless draw at Southampton while United beat West Ham United 4-0 on the opening weekend of the season. However, Clement is confident that his team can come out on top against Jose Mourinho’s side, as they have recorded two wins and a draw in their last five league games against United.

“(We’re) Excited, what a nice first game back at the Liberty. We had a good game at Old Trafford but we are different and so are they,” Clement said.

“They have started well and brought in some good players but we are confident because of what we did last season and our record against them is quite encouraging. We are looking forward to it and expect a really good atmosphere.”

Pattern visible on ‘love jihad’ in Kerala: Kiren Rijiju,"Kiren Rijiju (Source: ANI) Kiren Rijiju (Source: ANI)

A pattern is “visible” on ‘love jihad’ in Kerala, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said today and added that the Supreme Court’s order has “given some kind of legitimacy” to the NIA probe into the matter. The apex court had yesterday ordered the NIA to probe a case of conversion and marriage of a Hindu woman to a Muslim man, as the investigative agency claimed it was not an isolated incident but a “pattern” emerging in Kerala.

The Kerala High Court had earlier annulled the marriage, terming it as an instance of ‘love jihad’. When it is said that some women have reportedly accepted on camera that they have been lured into it (inter-religion wedding), a pattern is visible in the issue, said Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs. “The move of the NIA on this so-called ‘love jihad’ is being given some kind of legitimacy by the judgement you have heard, which has come from the honourable Supreme Court,” he told reporters when asked about the issue.

Rijiju, however, refused to comment on the case before the Supreme Court. “When the case is being investigated, I would not prefer to make a comment which will lead to some political twist on the issue. For us, this is not a political issue. This is an issue which local people have felt that there is something behind the whole pattern,” he said. “There is a pattern which is visible. But, If I make a comment, as I said, because I am from Home Ministry, people may twist this issue into some different angle. So, despite some pattern being visible I would not like to offer any comment from my side,” he said.

Asked about the reported comments of National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah that India faced a threat from within, the minister said the country is capable of dealing with any internal or external threat. “There are certain issues in our country which include internal threat. But that is not to the extent that the nation has to worry. India is capable of dealing with any internal or external threat,” he said.

Rijiju was speaking on the sidelines of an event organised by National Service Scheme (NSS) and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan. Earlier, in his address to the gathering, he said the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is becoming normal “because our government is committed to tackling the challenge.” The nation faced challenges from various quarters, but the NDA government in the last three years tried to “keep the country safe” for it to progress, the minister said.

Davinder Singh’s journey: Graduating from varsity to international football,"Constantine included Davinder Singh (above) in the squad for the tri-nation series against Mauritius and St Kitts, which begins in Mumbai on Saturday. Constantine included Davinder Singh (above) in the squad for the tri-nation series against Mauritius and St Kitts, which begins in Mumbai on Saturday.

Davinder Singh does not remember the breakfast menu. Rather, he couldn’t identify half of the items. For the last 10 years, the first meal on a match day was either a parantha or oil-soaked aloo-puri. But the elaborate spread on offer at a Singapore hotel wasn’t even his biggest shock. “The team meetings,” the 22-year-old says. “There used to be a small black board inside our changing room and the coach explained the strategies on it. Suddenly, I was watching videos and the coach was analysing me just like they do it on television,”Davinder said after returning from U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers last month.

The right-back doesn’t even get into the game play bit of it. The culture shock has been massive, and understandably so. A couple of months ago, Davinder was slugging it out on hard, uneven surfaces in the remotest corners of the country, playing inter-varsity tournaments for Punjabi University. Now, he is on the cusp of making his senior India debut.

After an impressive under-23 debut last month, chief coach Stephen Constantine included Davinder in the squad for the tri-nation series against Mauritius and St Kitts, which begins in Mumbai on Saturday. It’s the first time a player has been fast-tracked from a university team straight into the national squad, bypassing all the levels in between. And, as per the records available, it is also just the third time a player from the university ranks has made it to the national team – midfielder Eugeneson Lyngdoh and former striker Abhishek Yadav being the other two.

Yadav, incidentally, is now the chief scout. “I come from the university system. There are some really good players who play at that level but are lost since there wasn’t a system in place,” Yadav says. So Constantine and Yadav decided to cast their net wide. Scouts were packed off to Midnapore, roughly three hours from Kolkata, and Karaikudi in Tamil Nadu. Their brief was simple – strong players, especially in defence, who tackle hard and have strong aerial abilities. A list of 40 players was drawn, who were then invited for under-23 trials in Mumbai last month.

Forty became eight and eight were finally reduced to three. Suddenly, Davinder was in the India squad. “Davinder fit the bill. It wasn’t like we were looking for players in specific positions. He just was the kind of player who had the necessary attributes,” Yadav says. Davinder’s first taste of international football came in an Under-23 match against Singapore last month, and he was a fish out of water. His debut lasted 20 minutes and he came on as a second-half substitute in the second game. “The pace was too much to adjust, fitness wasn’t a problem. I drifted out of my position often, and couldn’t track back,” he says.

In those 65 minutes, though, Davinder showed he was just the kind of player Constantine likes in his defence – a strong and fearless tackler. After benching him in India’s defeat to Syria in the U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers, Davinder was handed his first start against Qatar. The impact was immediate. It turned out to be one of India’s finest defensive performances in recent times, despite losing 0-1 eventually. That was followed by another credible show against Turkmenistan, a match India won 3-1.

Come Saturday, Davinder might just become the 31st player to make his international debut in Constantine’s second stint as coach. He’s still pinching himself. “This isn’t a normal route, I know. Players spend years at various clubs before they are even considered,” he says. “I just hope to prove I belong here.”

China: Former head of Chinese news agency investigated for suspected graft,"The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.

The retired former head of an important state-run Chinese news agency has been put under investigation for suspected graft, the ruling Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog said on Wednesday. Liu Beixian, editor-in-chief of the China News Service until retiring in February 2015, was suspected of “serious discipline breaches”, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a statement. It provided no other details and it was not possible to reach Liu or a legal or family representative for comment.

The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and is designed to serve as a news source for Chinese communities in places like Hong Kong and self-ruled Taiwan. It is separate from Xinhua, China’s national official news agency.

Liu began working at the China News Service in 1983 and was its Hong Kong bureau chief from 1997 to 2000, according to his official resume, a period that coincided with the handover of the former British territory back to Chinese rule.

President Xi Jinping has mounted a sweeping campaign against deep-rooted corruption since taking office almost five years ago, jailing or meting out lesser punishments to hundreds of thousands of officials.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella condemns Charlottesville violence,"Microsoft executive Satya Nadella. (File/Photo) Microsoft executive Satya Nadella. (File/Photo)

India-born Microsoft executive Satya Nadella has condemned the violence at the white-nationalist rally in Virginia, saying there is no place in our society for the bias, bigotry and senseless violence. “Microsoft values diversity, and asked employees to empathise with “the hurt happening around us,” Nadella said. “There is no place in our society for the bias, bigotry and senseless violence we witnessed this weekend in Virginia provoked by white nationalists,” he said in a note sent to his employees at the Redmond-based company.

“It is an especially important time to continue to be connected with people, and listen and learn from each other’s experiences,” Nadella said in the memo, apparently sent to senior managers, the Seattle Times reported.

“As I’ve said, across Microsoft, we will stand together with those who are standing for positive change in the communities where we live, work, and serve. Together, we must embrace our shared humanity, and aspire to create a society that is filled with respect, empathy and opportunity for all,” he said.

His note comes as several high-profile executives, including the leaders of Intel and drugmaker Merck, quit a government advisory panel, some in protest of President Donald Trump’s initially subdued response to the violence.

‘Unite the Right’ march had been organised to protest against the proposed removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee, who commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Violence broke out after they were confronted by anti-racism groups and later a car ploughed into one group of anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville.

Trump had blamed both sides including the “alt-left” for the deadly violence.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbeurg also criticised Trump over his response to the rallies.

“I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights, Cook said in an email to his staff accessed by ReCode.

In a Facebook post, Mark Zuckerburg said, “there is no place for hate in our community. That’s why we’ve always taken down any post that promotes or celebrates hate crimes or acts of terrorism — including what happened in Charlottesville.”

“With the potential for more rallies, we’re watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm. We won’t always be perfect, but you have my commitment that we’ll keep working to make Facebook a place where everyone can feel safe,” he said.

"N K Amin, from encounter-accused officer to ‘outstanding performer’","N K Amin in court in 2010. File photo N K Amin in court in 2010. File photo

On Independence Day, Tapi (Gujarat) SP Narendra K Amin tweeted: “I and other ranks may have recd… May be an auto SMS but the concerns and cares 4 us by govt is unique in the Indian history.THx MY GOVT.” With the tweet he attached an SMS, purportedly sent from ‘MyGov’ on Independence Day, which is quoted as: “… PM Modi salutes your bravery, valour & sacrifices. Thank you for keeping 125 crore Indians safe.” Amin’s Twitter page has a picture of him shaking hands with PM Narendra Modi.

Amin has been vocal ever since he came out on bail after spending about eight years in jail in the encounter cases involving the deaths of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Ishrat Jahan. On August 31 last year, the day he was to retire, the state government extended Amin’s service and that of deputy SP Tarun Barot for one year, which ends this month. Now, their extension has been challenged in the Supreme Court, which raised questions about the decision Wednesday.

The government has been claiming the decision is well within the state laws and based on the officers’ “outstanding performances”. The challenge has come from retired IPS officer Rahul Sharma on the ground that the appointment is illegal and that the two officers are facing serious criminal charges.

Amin was alleged to have been involved in disposing of the body of Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s wife Kausarbi in 2005. The CBI case is that although Amin was not part of the Gujarat ATS, which carried out the encounter, he was in constant touch with other accused including officers D G Vanzara and R K Pandian. On August 2016, Amin was discharged by the special CBI court in Mumbai on the ground that “there was no sufficient materials to frame charges against him.”

In the Ishrat encounter, Amin was accused of firing at her and her companions in June 2004. He is out on bail in that case.

In its defence of the extension of Amin’s service, the government filed an affidavit Wednesday reiterating that his performance has been “outstanding.”

Recently, Amin was in a fresh controversy after Congress MLA Punabhai Gamit alleged Amin approached him to join the BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, a charge denied by Amin who has threatened legal action for defamation. “I challenge puna Gamit and Shaktisinh to prove their allegation or else ready to face the CONSEQUENCES thereof to drag and defame SP Tapi,” Amin tweeted.

Also, a journalist from Tapi approached Gujarat High Court seeking an FIR against Amin on the ground that he was confined at the SP office and stripsearched. The court asked the IG (Surat) to probe the allegation.

Amin, an MBBS, joined Gujarat police in 1996 as DSP. In 2007 he was arrested by the CID (crime) in the Sohrabuddin encounter and was in jail until 2015. Last year after the announcement of several promotions, he moved the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking elevation as an IPS officer; the case is pending.

Singapore: Man gets $3 million compensation after bad reference denies him new job,"A Singapore court has awarded a man S million in compensation after an unflattering reference from his former employer. (Representational Image) A Singapore court has awarded a man S million in compensation after an unflattering reference from his former employer. (Representational Image)

An Indian-origin man in Singapore has got 4 million Singaporean dollars ($2.9 million) in damages from his previous employer after a scathing reference letter by them cost him the chance to get a new job.

Ramesh Krishnan had accused AXA Life Insurance Singapore of defaming him while providing references on his work performance in 2012, the Strait Times reported on Tuesday.

Justice George Wei noted on Monday that the stands of both parties had been “polar opposites” when it came to damages. Ramesh had sought 63 million Singaporean dollars, while AXA urged he should be awarded only a nominal sum of 1 Singaporean dollar.

Krishnan lost his initial defamation suit in 2015, but the Court of Appeal later ruled that AXA had breached its duty of care to him, the report said. The court had also noted AXA’s breach of duty led Prudential Assurance Company Singapore not to hire Ramesh.

When the firm in which Krishnan had applied for a job asked AXA for the reference, it wrote back saying: “He showed a very poor 13th month persistency rate” — meaning that many of his clients did not stick with their policies — and “we are very concerned as to whether the clients have been provided with proper advice”.

The Court of Appeal said this would have given the mistaken impression that Ramesh was not competent, and did not square with the evidence that he was one of “AXA’s best financial services directors” and it had earlier persuaded him not to resign. “People must know that justice is served. Somebody must go out there and make a point,” said Ramesh, after the ruling.

Napoli win 2-0 with disputed penalty as Nice finish with nine,"Napoli, Nice, Indian Express. (Source: AP) Napoli, Nice, Indian Express. (Source: AP)

Napoli scored from a disputed penalty to beat Nice 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League playoff on Wednesday as the French side had two players sent off in quick succession late on.

Former European champions Celtic were helped by two own goals as they thumped Astana 5-0 at home and a late goal from Wissam Ben Yedder gave Sevilla a 2-1 win at Istanbul Basaksehir in torrential rain.

Olympiakos came from behind to beat Rijeka 2-1 at home with a last-minute goal from Jacques Alaixys Romao in another of the ties.

Italian sides have been beaten in the playoff ties for the last three seasons, but Napoli are well-placed to end that run after their win against Nice, who have never played in the group stage and were missing forward Mario

Balotelli with a hamstring injury.

Dries Mertens put Napoli ahead in the 13th minute when he raced onto Marek Hamsik’s chipped pass and thumped the ball into the far corner.

Jorginho converted a penalty in the 70th after Christophe Jallet tripped Mertens, although replays suggested it happened just outside the penalty area.

Nice were reduced to nine men in the 79th minute when Vincent Koziello was given a straight red card for a studs-up challenge on Piotr Zielinski and Alassane Plea was given a yellow card for protesting — his second of the game.

Napoli played their usual flowing football and Arkadiusz Milik squandered a chance for a third when he let the ball go under his foot with the goal at his mercy.

OWN GOALS

Celtic remarkably scored five goals despite managing only three shots on target, according to UEFA statistics.

Yevgeni Postnikov turned Tom Rogic’s cross into his own goal just after the half hour and Scott Sinclair steered the ball beyond Aleksandr Mokin to give Celtic a 2-0 halftime lead.

Sinclair struck again on the hour after the referee surprisingly waved play on following a clash of heads near the halfway line.

James Forrest drilled home a fourth and Igor Shitov deflected a fifth into his own goal.

Sevilla gave new coach Eduardo Berizzo a valuable win in his first competitive game in charge when Ben Yedder flicked in Jesus Navas’s cross with six minutes to play.

“Our opponents are a technical side. If you give them the ball, they make life hard for you. In the second leg we need to dictate the play more,” said the Argentine.

Rijeka, who last season broke Dinamo Zagreb’s run of 11 successive Croatian titles, are still in with a fighting chance of making the group stage for the first time after losing 2-1 to Olympiakos.

Brazilian striker Heber scored his first goal for Rijeka in the 42nd minute but Vadis Odjidja levelled with a thumping finish and, after Rijeka had left back Leonard Zuta sent off for a second booking, Romao headed the winner.

The second leg will be played in Rijeka’s tiny stadium which has a capacity of less than 9,000.

Nigerian Anthony Nwakaeme volleyed a spectacular goal from outside the area as Israeli champions Hapoel Beer Sheva, also looking for a first group stage appearance, beat Maribor 2-1.

Shir Tzedek converted a penalty in first-half stoppage time to give his side a slender lead to take to Slovenia next week.

Grigor Dimitrov rallies past Juan Martin del Potro at Cincinnati Open,"Grigor Dimitrov will face Yuichi Sugita. (Source: Reuters) Grigor Dimitrov will face Yuichi Sugita. (Source: Reuters)

Grigor Dimitrov rallied from a 4-1 second-set deficit for a 6-3, 7-5 win over Juan Martin del Potro and reached the Western & Southern Open quarterfinals on Thursday.

The seventh-seeded Dimitrov had to tighten up his game to pick up his first career win in six matches against Del Potro. Dimitrov improved to 15-13 in his last 28 matches after opening the season 16-1.

“I played pretty sloppy for the first three games,” Dimitrov said of the second set. “It was all my fault. I just thought if I stayed with him and made the right decisions, I would have a chance.”

Dimitrov will face Yuichi Sugita, who advanced with a 6-7 (0), 6-3, 6-3 win over Karen Khachanov.

David Ferrer reached his first ATP Masters 1000 quarterfinal in his last 11 tries with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Pablo Carreno Busta.

Second-seeded Simona Halep became the tournament’s first quarterfinalist with a 6-4, 6-3 win over 15th-seeded Anastasija Sevastova. The straight-set win was her second in two matches, but it hadn’t been as easy as it looked, she said.

“I’m not playing my best tennis, but winning when I’m not playing good is a plus for me,” Halep said. “I’m really happy about it.”

It’s the fifth straight year Halep, No. 2 in the rankings, has at least reached the W&S quarterfinals. She was runner-up to Serena Williams in 2015.

Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Carla Suarez Navarro.

"After a dozen years with UP, Piyush Chawla to join Parthiv Patel’s Gujarat","Piyush Chawla claimed that he is excited to join his new side which has won 3 trophies in the past 3 years. Piyush Chawla claimed that he is excited to join his new side which has won 3 trophies in the past 3 years.

UTTAR PRADESH leg-spinner Piyush Chawla is all set to shift base for the upcoming domestic season. After spending nearly a dozen years representing his home state of Uttar Pradesh in all domestic competitions, the leg-spinner will be part of Parthiv Patel’s Gujarat team who will be looking to defend their Ranji Trophy crown from last season.

Chawla, 28, has been around the Indian cricket scene for well over a decade but has played in just three Tests between 2006 and 2012 and taken 7 wickets. And most of his 386 first-class wickets came in the nearly 100 matches he played for Uttar Pradesh. Chawla will be the second UP cricketer to move west to Gujarat after another mainstay, RP Singh, made a similar shift two years ago.

Chawla though like RP didn’t cite any issue with his home team for taking the decision to move. “I had a word with Parthiv (Gujarat captain) and expressed my intention to play for Gujarat. There is no specific reason of me leaving UP. I have explained my point of view to the UPCA and they got my point,” Chawla told The Indian Express explaining the shift.

Chawla broke into the Indian team when he was still only 17 and was touted to be a future star while making his debut against England at Mohali in 2006. But he’s somehow never lived up to that early hype and has since been overshadowed by a number of other spinners, including fellow leg-spinner Amit Mishra. It is only recently, however, that he’s slipped out of the reckoning, coming to the fore more during the IPL season after season for two-time winners Kolkata Knight Riders. Considering how young he is—he’s the same age as Ravindra Jadeja and two years younger than R Ashwin—it’s unlikely that Chawla has given up on a possible India recall.

And it’s not surprising to hear him mention the more spinner-friendly pitches in the western part of the country as having been one of the key reasons behind the move. Gujarat play mostly at Valsad and Surat, which have seen spinners dominate proceedings.

Chawla only played two Ranji games for UP last year and managed all of two wickets. But he’s expecting to play a more integral and significant role for his new team as a professional player. A role, he feels, like RP who was one of the stars of Gujarat’s Ranji win last season. UP’s failure to win a major trophy over the last decade could well have been another factor behind Chawla turning professional.

The presence of Kuldeep Yadav, who’s now emerged as a major future hope for India, in the UP squad meant that Chawla was no longer the primary spinner.

“As a player it’s quite exciting to join a team which has won 3 trophies in the last 3 years. It’s not that I was not happy in UP but something was missing. I want to add value to the team. When you go as a professional you have that added responsibility on your shoulders. The pressure is different, which often enhances your performance,” he added.

Indian gets 4 million Singaporean dollars from former employer in Singapore,"Justice George Wei noted on Monday that the stands of both parties had been “polar opposites” when it came to damages. (File/Photo) Justice George Wei noted on Monday that the stands of both parties had been “polar opposites” when it came to damages. (File/Photo)

A 47-year-old Indian-origin Singaporean has received a hefty compensation of over 4 million Singaporean dollars from his previous employer after a scathing letter of reference by them cost him the chance to join another company. Ramesh Krishnan, described as “one of AXA’s best-compensated advisers”, had accused the company of defaming him in 2012 when providing references on his work performance, The Straits Times reported. Krishnan lost the defamation suit in the High Court in 2015, but the Court of Appeal later ruled that AXA had breached its duty of care to him, the report said.

Justice George Wei noted on Monday that the stands of both parties had been “polar opposites” when it came to damages. Krishnan had sought 63 million Singaporean dollar, while AXA urged he should be awarded only a nominal sum of 1 Singaporean dollar.

Starting from April 2011, this included a commencement allowance of 675,000 Singaporean dollars, and an initial monthly salary of 65,625 Singaporean dollars for the first 12 months and 43,750 Singaporean dollars for the following months till July last year.

He also looked at loss of future earnings between August last year and July next year at a discounted rate.

An AXA Singapore spokesman said on Monday it is seeking legal advice on the judgment.

“Providing for and protecting our policyholders is our top priority and we remain committed to ensuring that our appointed representatives are fit and proper and meet the competency, financial soundness and integrity standards required by us and the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore),” the spokesman was quoted as saying.

Ramesh said: “People must know that justice is served. Somebody must go out there and make a point”.

"Dalit woman’s nose ‘cut’, husband beaten up in Madhya Pradesh village","Inspector Bagri said that she had sustained an injury to the nose, and police were waiting for the medical report. (Source: Google map) Inspector Bagri said that she had sustained an injury to the nose, and police were waiting for the medical report. (Source: Google map)

A 35-year-old Dalit woman’s nose was allegedly slashed and her husband was beaten up by two members of an upper caste family at Renvjha village in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Narendra Singh (32) and his father Sahab Singh beat up the woman’s husband on Monday when he refused to go to their house and do some work, inspector R S Bagri of Surkhi police station said.

When the woman was taking her husband to a hospital, Narendra and Sahab attacked her too, the police officer said. Madhya Pradesh Women’s Commission (MPWC) chairperson Lata Wankhede claimed that the woman’s nose was cut.

Inspector Bagri said that she had sustained an injury to the nose, and police were waiting for the medical report.

The incident came to light on Wednesday when the woman went to a camp organised by the MPWC in the area to hear complaints of violation of women’s rights, and narrated her ordeal to Wankhede.

The MPWC chief told reporters that the accused, who wanted to make the woman and her husband “bonded labourers”, had cut the woman’s nose.

She had directed the police to arrest the accused and take strict action in the case, Wankhede said.

Bagri said the police registered a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC and also under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and were looking for the accused who were absconding.

“The woman is being treated at a hospital. We are waiting for doctor’s report about the injury to her nose. If the report confirms serious injury to nose and internal injuries, harsher sections will be slapped against the accused,” the inspector said.

Diet tips: The right food habits during monsoon,"Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups during the rainy season. Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups during the rainy season.

Rainy Season is when chances of stomach infection can increase due to faulty eating habits. One can reduce the chances of such health complications easily by making a few alterations to their daily diet, says experts.

Mehar Rajput, Nutritionist and Dietitian at FITPASS, and Aditi Sharma, Chief Dietitian at Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad, dole out tips on how one can take care of infection:

* Include garlic, pepper, ginger, asafoetida, jeera powder, turmeric and coriander in food as it help enhance digestion and improve immunity.

* Should prefer boiled water during rainy season because germs are present in water. Have medium to low salt food and avoid heavy salty food as they are responsible for high blood pressure, promoting bloating and water retention.

* Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups. But be careful about the fish and prawns. Avoid too much of fish and meat this season with heavy curries.

* Include warm dal or soup in your diet. Add spices like turmeric, clove, black pepper and sauf in it.

* Consuming hot soups during monsoon can reduce inflammation and help fight infection.

* Avoid taking food and vegetables in raw form. Like raw sprouts, they can cause indigestion and lead to gastric problems.

* Turmeric is not only a great antibiotic but is also known to have anti-inflammatory and healing properties which can really help in reducing inflammation in the digestive system.

* Sauf water can be consumed after every meal in order to help you digest food and reduce the chances of gastric problems.

US talks tough on trade deficit as NAFTA discussions begin,"The operation came as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs and could complicate efforts to secure a common stance. The operation came as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs and could complicate efforts to secure a common stance.

The United States drew a hard line for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday, demanding major concessions aimed at slashing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada and boosting US content for autos. At the start of talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump’s top trade adviser, Robert Lighthizer, said Trump was not interested in “a mere tweaking” of the 23-year-old pact, which Trump has threatened to scrap without major changes.

“We feel that NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,” Lighthizer, the US trade representative, said at the start of the talks, which reflected Trump’s relentless criticism that NAFTA has caused massive US manufacturing job losses.

Lighthizer put Mexico and Canada on notice that the United States would use its clout as their biggest export customer to wring concessions, saying the United States wanted substantially tougher rules of origin, including a requirement of “substantial US content” for autos.

He also signaled a fight over NAFTA’s trade dispute settlement system for changes that would allow more anti-dumping duties against Canada and Mexico, saying this provision should “respect our national sovereignty.”

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland suggested earlier this week that her country could walk away if the United States insisted on scrapping the “Chapter 19” trade dispute settlement system that requires the use of binational panels.

In her opening statement, Freeland took a swipe at the US fixation on cutting its trade deficits, saying: “Canada does not view trade surpluses or deficits as a primary measure of whether a trading relationship works. US-Canada-Mexico trade has quadrupled since NAFTA took effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015.

MEXICO: NAFTA HAS TO “WORK FOR ALL PARTIES”

Lighthizer blamed NAFTA for a direct loss of 700,000 US manufacturing jobs since the pact took effect in 1994, a period that coincides with increasing automation across all industries that has allowed more output with fewer workers.

Auto industry groups have warned against changing the pact’s rules of origin, which govern how much of a product’s components must originate from NAFTA countries. They said the pact has allowed them to build a competitive North American supply base that has helped boost exports of US-assembled vehicles globally.

The pact also has massively boosted US farm income by increasing agricultural exports to both Mexico and Canada. “We do not want them to use us as a trading tool and to do harm to the agricultural sector in all three countries,” the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall, told a news conference on Wednesday. Corporate chief executives have been sounding “do no harm” warnings on NAFTA for months.

Trump’s relationship with business executives became a high-profile issue this week as he disbanded two business advisory councils after several CEOs quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence at a rally in Virginia on the protesters who opposed white nationalists as well as the white nationalists themselves. Canadian and Mexican officials at the NAFTA talks on Wednesday declined to weigh in.

Asked if there was concern that the political upheaval around Trump could impact the NAFTA talks, Mexico’s finance ministry undersecretary, Vanessa Rubio, said: “These are internal issues of the United States.” Freeland refused to be drawn into the US political furor during a news conference before she returned to Ottawa.

The first round of NAFTA talks, which will last until Sunday, are expected to focus on consolidating the proposals and demands from all three countries. The long list of US demands could make it difficult for negotiators to reach agreement on modernization plans that also are expected to include new chapters on digital and energy trade, and environmental, labor and currency standards.

Both Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo pushed back at the US demands and defended NAFTA. Guajardo said NAFTA should be modernized to produce more trade among its participants, not less, and needed more than one winner. “For a deal to be successful, it has to work for all parties involved. Otherwise, it is not a deal,” Guajardo said.

Guajardo later told a news conference that it was “too soon” for the three countries to begin narrowing their differences. He said it was not a good idea to add country-specific content requirements to the agreement.

Mexico is keen to maintain preferential access for its goods and services to the United States and Canada, where nearly 85 percent of its exports are shipped. Its NAFTA priorities also include greater integration of the continent’s labor markets and energy sectors.

Weighing heavily over the talks is the 2018 Mexico presidential election. Mexico has urged all sides to complete the negotiations before the campaign ramps up in February to avoid having them become a political punching bag.

Anxiety surround Charlottesville residents after violent rally,"Local residents of Charlottesville sit together, pay their respects and cry at a vigil where 20 candles were burned for the 19 people injured and one killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter protesters at the “Unite the Right” rally organized by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters) Local residents of Charlottesville sit together, pay their respects and cry at a vigil where 20 candles were burned for the 19 people injured and one killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter protesters at the “Unite the Right” rally organized by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters)

A disquiet anxiety has surrounded the residents of Charlottesville, many of whom are Indian Americans, after a rally of white supremacists ended in violent clashes with counter-protesters and claimed the life a 32-year-old woman. While normalcy seemed to have returned to the city by afternoon yesterday, residents grappled with shock and fear following a day of violence when a car rammed into a crowd peacefully protesting against the rally by white supremacists.

The city in the US state of Virginia has a significant Indian and Indian-American population, but there was no report of anyone from the community being injured in the violence on Saturday. Two police officers monitoring the demonstration died following a helicopter crash near the protest site and 19 others were injured, though, unofficial figures could be high.

“It’s still difficult for us to understand and grapple with the reality that such a thing has happened. This is not what the city is about,” Sankaran Venkataraman, said Senior Associate Dean for Faculty and Research, MasterCard, Professor of Business Administration at the University of Virginia. Venkataraman has lived in Charlottesville, which is about 120 miles southwest of Washington DC, for nearly 20 years.

His daughters’ friend had gone to the downtown to take part in the counter protest to the white supremacist rally on Saturday. She has returned with a broken leg. “(The violence) doesn’t represent any of the views or characters of the people here. We are progressive people who believe in diversity and inclusiveness. “For something like this to happen is a shock to us. The notions of racism, hatred, bigotry are completely antithetical to the views of most citizens of Charlottesville,” Venkataraman, who recently returned from Tamil Nadu, said.

The Virginia university, closed for summer, is set to open in two weeks and students, a sizable number from outside the US, including India, would start arriving next week. “I am sure there’s a sense of anxiety among students here,” Venkataraman added. Vilas Annavarapu, an Indian-American and student of political science at the university, was among the few who stayed back at the campus to attend to their training classes.

Annavarapu is also an office-bearer of the Indian Student Association at the varsity. It has about 300 active members. While he did not leave the campus on Saturday, he had a scary encounter with white supremacists on Friday night when hundreds of them had a surprise rally inside the campus. “They came like right there,” Annavarapu said, pointing to the place inside the campus where the gathering happened. “It was frightening,” he said.

“Frustration I think, would be an accurate word to describe the general sentiment,” Annavarapu said. “From an intellectual standpoint, I’ve always understood that being a person of colour, I will have to be more careful when I walk down the streets. But I don’t think I’ve ever felt as threatened as I have over these past two days.” The protesters were openly carrying guns, including AK-47, reports said.

Annavarapu feels the election of Donald Trump, who has a following among the white supremacists, as the US president has encourage the far-right groups. “It’s not like these views are anything new, it’s just that now people feel as if they have the authority to come into public and wave them around, as if they’re not doing anything wrong. I understand that they have free speech, but that doesn’t give them the right to incite violence,” he said.

For Larry Goedde Jr, a guitar technician by profession, it was a harrowing experience. His faced was banged on the concrete street by one of the white supremacists on Saturday, causing several bruises to his face. “I was just crossing the street and this pickup truck rolled up on me. And they just slammed me down face first, stomped me and then just drove,” he said.

Goedde, who recently returned to his home town after 11 years in Montreal, said many others faced similar situation. “I wasn’t the only one that described this scene. When I went to the ER (emergency room at the hospital) last night, it was full of people. Like with injuries. All of the staff were just, they were tired. They were covered in blood,” he said.

Goedde, however, said the city residents have maintained their cool. “It’s unbelievable. The only people that they (police) were willing to protect was the white supremacist. They had no intention of ever protecting any other… If you weren’t holding an assault rifle, and if you didn’t have a swastika on you, they were not interested in protecting you. And that’s not hyperbole. I just saw it over and over again”.

For eminent Indologist and resident of Charlottesville Daniel J Ehnbom, it was terrible experience. “The principle blame is with the neo-Nazis, because they deliberately set up to make trouble and they did. It’s a very sad thing for Charlottesville. People are still shocked,” Ehnbom said.

“The town and the university have a long way to go to heal this. There is a lot to be done about race relations, racism,” the author of the Indian Miniatures asserted. “The fact that this manifest itself in (Thomas) Jefferson’s hometown is horrifying,” Ehnbom said, referring to the third president of the United States and the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.

Viswanathan Anand starts badly in St. Louis Rapid,"The Indian ace was pegged back by an opening round loss against Hikaru Nakamura of United States. (Source: File) The Indian ace was pegged back by an opening round loss against Hikaru Nakamura of United States. (Source: File)

Former world champion Viswanathan Anand failed to change gears and suffered two losses on the opening day of St. Louis Rapid and Blitz chess

the tournament, a part of the Grand Chess Tour.

Having done brilliantly for a joint second place in the just-concluded Sinquefield Cup at the same venue, Anand needed a change of guard for the faster version of the game.

The Indian ace was pegged back by an opening round loss against Hikaru Nakamura of United States and then suffered another debacle against Levon Aronian of Armenia in the third round.

The second round had ended in a draw for Anand against Lenier Dominguez of Cuba. Anand could muster just one point under the rules from three games here and will have to come back much stronger in the remaining six rounds of this USD 150000 prize money tournament.

A win in rapid is worth two points here while a draw fetches half a point. In the blitz however, standard one point will be awarded for a win and half for a draw. After the end of the first day and three rounds, Fabiano Caruana of United States, Le Quang Leim of Vietnam, Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Aronian emerged as co leaders on four points each.

However, the highlight of the day was legendary Russian Garry Kasparov’s come back to competitive fold after a gap of 12 years. It was shortly after the last game of Linares 2005 when the Russian, the strongest ever player on the planet then, decided to hang his boots.

The comeback announcement had already invoked massive enthusiasm in the fans and players alike and when he sat down to play his first move, it was incidentally with the other Russian Sergey Karjakin.

The game ended in a draw. Kasparov troubled his former small-time protege Hikaru Nakamura before taking another draw. In the third game of the day too, Kasparov was held to a draw by Dominguez but said he was extremely satisfied on day one of his return.

With four leaders on four, Kasparov, Dominguez, Nakamura and Karjakin have an identical three points for a shared fifth spot. Anand and David Navara of Czech Republic are currently at the bottom having one point each.

The second day will see Anand clashing with Kasparov, which will revive more than 25 years of rivalry.

Standings after round 3: 1-4: Levon Aronian (Arm), Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus), Le Quang Leim (Vie), Fabiano Caruana (Usa) 4 each; 5-8: Garry Kasparov, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Sergey Karjakin (All Russia), Hikaru Nakamura (USA) 3 each; 9-10: V Anand (Ind), David Navara (Cze) 1 each.

Giovanni Simeone signs for Fiorentina,"After moving to Genoa, Giovannni Simeone found himself as a reserve to Leonardo Pavoletti but got his chance. (Source: Twitter) After moving to Genoa, Giovannni Simeone found himself as a reserve to Leonardo Pavoletti but got his chance. (Source: Twitter)

Giovanni Simeone, son of Atletico Madrid coach and former Argentina captain Diego, has signed for Fiorentina, the Serie A club said in a statement.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity and what I wanted,” the 22-year-old forward said after his move from Genoa. Simeone, whose father was renowned as a bruising midfielder, scored 12 goals in 35 appearances for Genoa in his first season in Serie A.

Since making his professional debut for Buenos Aires club River Plate four years ago, Simeone has had a number of highs and lows in his career to date.

After a promising first season, he was unable to hold down a regular place and spent the 2015-16 season on loan at smaller neighbours Banfield, where he scored 12 goals in 31 appearances.

He showed more of his potential at the under-20 South American championship in 2015, where he was leading scorer with nine goals as he helped Argentina win the title.

After moving to Genoa, he found himself as a reserve to Leonardo Pavoletti but got his chance — and took it — after the first-choice forward was injured.

"After disease, the flood: In vicinity of Gorakhpur, families on highway with their children, cattle","A villager carries his calf near the flooded highway Wednesday. Express photo by Vishal Srivastav A villager carries his calf near the flooded highway Wednesday. Express photo by Vishal Srivastav

Already fighting disease, villagers of eastern Uttar Pradesh found themselves at the mercy of floods Wednesday as they had to to take shelter on the roadside with their children and cattle.

Flood water started rising suddenly early morning on the outskirts of Gorakhpur and Maharajganj as many embankments developed cracks. By the end of the day, roads as well as villages were submerged.

“We did not get time to take out our belongings. Last night, some people came shouting that the embankment has broken. We ran with whatever we could, some with a charpoy, some with grain. Some tried to save their cattle but most of it wqas washed away in flood,” said Ram Pyare Yadav, 60. “We have to ensure food for ourselves as well as our animals.”

He is from Jungle Dudhi village on Pharendra-Maharajganj Road, which is under water. Villagers have made a temporary shade using plastic bags and bamboo sticks. Over 1,000 families of his village have been affected, he said.

“Everything happened so fast that we did not get time to even go back for more belongings,” said Leelavati, 37, settled on the roadside with her two children. “Water from the river Rapti often enters our houses but this time it has destroyed everything. Even our grain, stored in tanks for the rest of the year, is soaked and we are trying to dry it.”

At Mujahana village, one side of the road with huts and hand-pumps are all under water. On the other side the fields are flooded but the water is yet to reach huts as some of the villagers have blocked the culvert leading there.

“Udhar to sab ghar doob hi gaya hai, agar culvert khol diya to idhar bhi sarae gaon doob jayenge,” Valmiki Kumar argued with district administration officials.

Said sub-district magistrate R B Singh, who reached the spot, “There are 10 villages that have gone under after water was released from Nepal yesterday. Eighty per cent of the water is from Nepal and only 20% is because of the rainfall here. We are undertaking rescue operation with the help of SSB and NDRF.”

Said Rajesh Kumar, SSB inspector, “Some of the people in pucca houses have refused to move out. We are trying to convince them to leave.”

In Gorakhpur, Jafar colony near Tiwaripur was submerged Thursday following a leak in the Domingarh dam.

At least 33 deaths people have died of flood-related causes in Uttar Pradesh so far. The floods have affected 22 districts, 1,623 villages and a population over 12.80 lakh in the eastern Uttar Pradesh. According to government figures, 996 of these villages are cut off.

According to State Disaster Management Department data, 10 of the 33 deaths were reported in the last two days.

Happy Friendship Day 2017: Spoil your friends with these gifts,"This Friendship Day, gift that special person in your life something awesome. You can thank us later. (Source: Thinkstock Images) This Friendship Day, gift that special person in your life something awesome. You can thank us later. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Certain days in the calendar are set aside to celebrate special people. And it is only fitting that we celebrate the contributions of our mothers and fathers in our lives. Apart from them, there are also those who we choose to be a part of our lives, who stay with us through thick and thin and who provide us with a comforting hug whenever things look bleak — friends. As it is often said, friends are the family we choose for ourselves and while we speak to them almost every day of the year, there is specific day on which we intend to spoil them rotten — Friendship Day. This year Friendship Day is on August 6, and if you are running out of ideas on what to gift your best friend, don’t worry we’ve got you covered.

Here are some gifting ideas for your friends.

For the creative and the imaginative souls, books it is

(Source: Thinkstock Images) (Source: Thinkstock Images)

We all have that friend who sheds copious tears when a fictional character dies, and who cancels plans at the last minute because they have to finish the book. Sure you have fought with them all year round, and cribbed hard when they stood up on you, but make peace this Friendship Day and gift a book. Book lovers will tell you nothing gives them greater joy than a new book.

Power bank, for the night-long conversations continue undisturbed

(Source: Thinkstock Images) (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Call it a boring choice all you want, but in this day and age when we carry our phone chargers with more diligence than a water bottle, power banks are a saviour. Also, remember the number of times the line went dead just when you were coming to the interesting bit of your story because your friend’s phone ran out of charge? Remember how that hurt? It’s time to change that.

Plant for those who want a pet

(Source: Thinkstock Images) (Source: Thinkstock Images)

We all have that one friend who really, really wants a pet. And though gifting a pup or a kitten is a great idea, it is also a lot of work that said friend may not be equipped to handle. So start with something simpler and stationary, maybe? Gift a plant and let them get into the habit of watering it everyday. If you see they are doing fine, get them the pup they have been eyeing for next year.

Funky sunglasses for that ‘cool’ friend in the group

(Source: Thinkstock Images) (Source: Thinkstock Images)

A good pair of sunglasses can effectively change the entire look and we all have that friend who can really carry them off. Choose your pick according to the gender and their preference, but a pair of funky eye sunglasses makes for a great gift.

A pair of great speakers for the parties that are lined up

(Source: Thinkstock Images) (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Let us begin by saying a par of speakers is an investment. Sure, you and your friends like similar kind of music (and if you all don’t, haven’t you forced the other to sit through each other’s favourite song?) and for all the future fun parties you both have planned in your heads, having a good pair of speakers is a must for that.

Quirky eye masks for the sleepyheads

Eye masks are quirky, fun and very useful. And believe us they make great gifts. Most of us have a friend who loves to sleep and will tolerate no disturbance, so for them get these fun eye masks and see their face light up in joy. Believe us.

‘Jail bharo’ agitation: 700 farmers held in Haryana,"The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” (File Photo) The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” (File Photo)

Nearly 700 farmers have been arrested so far owing to a ‘Jail Bharo’ agitation in Haryana that began on August 9 to push for farm loan waiver. The agitation will continue on Monday, the concluding day of its current phase.

The farmers, in groups, have been courting arrests at mainly four places Pipli (Kurukshetra), Karnal, Uklana (Hisar) and Sirsa, apart from other regions in the state.

The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” Farmers are demanding crop price as suggested by the Swaminathan Commission report, which had recommended 50 per cent profit over and above the cost of production.

Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) state unit acting president Karam Singh Mathana told The Indian Express on Sunday that the most of the farmers courted arrests during the stir are still lodged in jails. BKU state president Gurnam Singh Chaduni is lodged in Yamunanagar jail since August 9 when he had led a group of farmers to offer arrest at Pipli.

“We are forced to court arrest because the farmers are still facing economic crisis even 70 years after Independence,” said Rakesh Bains, spokesperson of BKU, while addressing a group of farmers who had reached Pipli to court arrest under the movement on Sunday. “The farmers have produced foodgrains for the country but they are still facing tough times for their livelihood. Earlier, the farmers had helped in bringing Green Revolution but now they are gearing up for a Kisan Revolution,” he added.

According to Bains, thousands of farmers in 21 other states apart from Haryana have also participated in the ongoing Jail Bharo agitation by offering court arrests. “If the government doesn’t make clear its policy on the issue of farm loans, the farmers will be forced to launch a bigger agitation,” he warned.

"To boost Congress cadre’s morale, Ahmed Patel to hold meetings across state","The party has divided the entire state into four zones — North, East, Central and South.

After emerging victorious in the closely-contested Rajya Sabha elections from Gujarat, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel will hold a series of meetings of party workers across the state to boost their morale ahead of the Assembly elections in the state.

The party has divided the entire state into four zones — North, East, Central and South. Ahmed Patel, who is the political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, will remain present in each of these meetings, which will also be attended by the 43 Congress MLAs who voted for him in the Rajya Sabha polls.

The first such meeting will be held next week in Surat, where party workers from Surat, Bharuch, Navsari, Valsad, Dang and Tapi will be present. Surat unit leaders of the party has planned to book an indoor stadium for the meeting as they expect that a large number of Congress workers will attend the meet.

“We are delighted that such meeting is going to take place in Surat. Local Congress leaders will felicitate all the elected MLAs and Ahmed Patel. Party workers from the entire south Gujarat will be present at the meeting, which is being organised to boost the morale of party workers ahead of the Assembly elections. Similar meetings will be held in Vadodara and other parts of the state,” said AICC member Kadir Pirzada.

With South Gujarat being a tribal belt, the party is working hard to win the tribal voters back to the Congress.

Following his victory in the Rajya Sabha elections, which he termed as the “toughest election contest” of his life, Patel said that his party will now aim to win 125 of the 182 seats in the next Assembly elections. The Congress has been out of power for nearly two decades in the state. Recently, the party had suffered a huge setback with the exit of senior Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela and over a dozen MLAs.

Tales from princely states: A Kashmiri Pandit and a Jodhpur resident recollect being stuck between India and Pakistan,"A N Pandita (left) and S K Rathi (right) (Express Photo) A N Pandita (left) and S K Rathi (right) (Express Photo)

The pampered Indian princes of the British Raj were perhaps the biggest liability of the politicians across the subcontinent. As the date of Independence drew near, the question over the 500-odd chiefdoms and states was the toughest one to deal with. By the late 1930s, the Congress had made clear their intention of integrating the states into the Indian union. But the process was far from being that simple. Mollycoddled by the British for decades now, and exploited by them simultaneously, for many of the princes the departure of the British was seen as the ideal moment when they could make a choice of autonomy, announcing independent statehood on the world map. Then there were others who were caught in the tussle between the newly born dominions of India and Pakistan.

However, the discretion of choice over India, Pakistan or independent statehood lay in the hands of the political elite, the affluent princes. What did that choice mean to the ordinary folks residing in these states, far removed from the high drama of nationalist discourse and very often unaware of what course their homeland’s politics was about to take?

Often referred to as ‘paradise on earth’ Kashmir lay in a location strategic for both Hindustan and Pakistan. With a Hindu king ruling over a predominant Muslim population, the fate of Kashmir was one of the toughest to come to terms with. A direct result of the chaos that the fight over Kashmir led to was the first Indo-Pakistan war that took place barely weeks after independence. A.N. Pandita, who was 19 at the time of the war, recollects the days when caught between the nationalist thirst of India and Pakistan, his largely peaceful childhood home had overnight turned into a space distraught with the fear of being attacked by the either of the two sides. The 89-year-old recollects:

I was born in a village called Rahama in Kashmir. It was a huge village with only seven Kashmiri Pandits residing in it. People in the village were either involved in farming or worked with the forest department. I was a free child. I loved playing with my friends, most of whom were Muslims. I loved eating arcots and would climb trees in pursuit of the same.

We were a well-fed family. But in 1941 we met with a huge tragedy. One of my brothers passed away and it was a huge setback to the family. The grief over his death resulted in my father’s illness and we moved to Baramulla city where a number of our relatives lived. We lived in district headquarters there and I finished my education there.

The early 1940s were the years of the Quit India movement. I remember when we saw Englishmen coming in from Delhi to our city, we would follow them around and doodle ‘Quit India’ in chalk behind their vehicles. We were told that the English would get scared when we would sing Vande Mataram in our school and college.

When Partition was announced, the country split into two. While we were hearing about the deaths and violence in Punjab, Kashmir was suddenly attacked by Pakistani bandits. The attacks first took place in Muzaffarabad. People from there started pouring into Baramulla. As the refugees kept coming in we moved from the city to our village in Rahama.

The next two-three days we were given refuge by a land tiller who was Muslim. I vividly remember the hours spent hiding in his house. We could hear cries of ‘Pakistan zindabad, Hindustan Murdabad’ outside.

One day, at around 4 am, we saw from the attic the Pakistani soldiers approaching the house. We were extremely scared that we would be killed. My uncle had a two-month-old daughter who was with us then. She lay in her mother’s lap and started crying at this moment. My aunt attempted to shut her up by covering her mouth with her hand, so that we do not get discovered by the men. In the process the little girl died. The following day a politician from the National Conference visited us. My father suggested to him that the best solution at this moment was to turn into Muslims. We came out and told everyone that we were Muslims. We visited a Maulvi and sang the phrase ‘la illah ila allah muhammad rasulullah’ which was considered to be the formula for converting to Islam. We learned the kalima and became Muslims for a good 10-12 days. I was also given a Muslim name- Muhammad Maqbool.

Two days later when we went back to Baramulla, the city was in a horrific state. All shops and houses were looted. Kashmiri Pandits there too had turned into Muslims. We were kept in a rehabilitation camp and were forced to sing slogans of ‘Pakistan zindabad’.

Few days later we got news of the Indian army coming in. We were all very happy on seeing the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani army soon started fleeing. However, now the Muslims were scared. They started running away and some came to our home for shelter.

Finally after all this chaos, Kashmir did accede into India. Par aaj ka Kashmir, woh Kashmir nahi raha, woh bhaichara nahi raha (But today’s Kashmir is no longer the Kashmir of the past, that brotherhood is no longer there).

Pandita moved to Delhi during the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in 1990 and currently resides Ashok Vihar with his wife, son and daughter-in-law.

Dr. S.K.Rathi of Jodhpur: ‘There were no celebrations in Nagaur’

The case of Jodhpur was far more curious. A Hindu king ruling over a majority Hindu population decided to join Pakistan at one point. An affinity towards Pakistan was based on the fact that Jodhpur shared a border with the country and that also Jinnah had tried to lure him with some special facilities. Dr S K Rathi, currently a resident of Kota, was a school boy living in Nagaur, part of the Jodhpur state, when India became independent. He recounts, often with a lot of effort, the atmosphere in his village when the British decided to leave and Jodhpur became part of India.

I spent my childhood in Nagaur. My father was a businessman and was also involved in money lending. We had two houses in Nagaur and one in Vasni which was situated a few kilometres away. During those days we had no electricity in our village, nor did we have pukka roads and proper water supply.

Vasni had a Muslim majority, while in Nagaur Hindus were in majority. I had many Muslim friends in Vasni. Muhammad Akbar was a very special friend of mine. We grew up together. We used to play gilli danda and kancha and he also taught me to ride the bicycle.

Growing up we never saw any Englishmen, but somehow knew that they ruled over India. When we were in class 8 or 9 we learnt that they were about to leave. Our teachers used to ask us to line up and raise slogans in praise of Nehru and Gandhi so we would do that. Later, we were told that the English had left and now only Indians ruled.

Only political people knew whether we would go to India or Pakistan. We were ordinary people and we did not know anything and neither did it matter to us back then. We knew that many of the Muslims from Vasni had left for Pakistan. One of our neighbours also left for Pakistan and after he went we never spoke. They were not sure if they were safe so they left. Later their houses were sold off at very cheap rates.

On August 15 when the country became independent there were no celebrations in Nagaur, neither did we get to know anything.

We saw a lot of celebration only once Jodhpur joined India. There was a huge function in school and that is how we got to know. Some political leaders had come and they distributed sweets among the students.

Independence did not really have any impact on our daily lives. Na pehle koi problem tha, na baad mein koi sudhaar aayi (neither did we have any problems before, nor did we see any improvement later).

Donald Trump again blames ‘on both sides’ for Charlottesville,"President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)

A combative President Donald Trump insisted Tuesday “there is blame on both sides” for the deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, appearing to once again equate the actions of white supremacist groups and those protesting them. The president’s comments effectively wiped away the more conventional statement he delivered at the White House one day earlier when he branded members of the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as “criminals and thugs.”

Trump’s advisers had hoped those remarks might quell a crush of criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. The president’s retorts Tuesday suggested he had been a reluctant participant in that cleanup effort. During an impromptu press conference in the lobby of his Manhattan skyscraper, he praised his original response to Charlottesville and angrily blamed liberal groups in addition to white supremacist for the violence. Some of those protesting the rally to save a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee were “also very violent,” he said.

“There are two sides to a story,” he said. He added that some facts about the violence still aren’t known.

His remarks were welcomed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who tweeted: “Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth.” Democrats were aghast at Trump’s comments. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said on Twitter that he no longer views Trump as his president.

“As a Jew, as an American, as a human, words cannot express my disgust and disappointment,” Schatz said. “This is not my president.”

As Trump talked, his aides on the sidelines of the lobby stood in silence. Chief of staff John Kelly crossed his arms and stared down at his shoes, barely glancing at the president. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders looked around the room trying to make eye contact with other senior aides. One young staffer stood with her mouth agape.

When asked to explain his Saturday comments about Charlottesville, Trump looked down at his notes and again read a section of his initial statement that denounced bigotry but did not single out white supremacists. He then tucked the paper back into his jacket pocket.

Violence broke out Saturday in Charlottesville, a picturesque college town, after a loosely connected mix of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists assembled for the largest gathering of its kind in a decade. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a man plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.

Trump, who has quickly deemed other deadly incidents in the US and around the world acts of terrorism, waffled when asked whether the car death was a terrorist attack.

“There is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism?” Trump said. “And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer and what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.”

Trump said he had yet to call Heyer’s mother, said that he would soon “reach out.” He praised her for what he said was a nice statement about him on social media. As Trump finally walked away from his lectern, he stopped to answer one more shouted question: Would be plan to visit Charlottesville? The president’s response was to note that he owned property there and to say it was one of the largest wineries in the United States.

England unsure what to expect as pink-ball cricket arrives,"The demands on pink balls, which must last 80 overs, are much greater than those on white balls, which are used for shorter forms of the game. (Source: AP) The demands on pink balls, which must last 80 overs, are much greater than those on white balls, which are used for shorter forms of the game. (Source: AP)

England’s cricketers admit they will be taking a leap in the dark when the country hosts its first day-night test, with a pink ball, against the West Indies this week.

Few England players have any experience with the ball, which will be the centre of attention when the first test gets under way at 1300 GMT at Edgbaston on Thursday.

England seamer Stuart Broad said it would be a “step into the unknown” and that bowlers will have to “figure out what’s going on”.

Earlier this week, he said he had only ever bowled a single delivery with the new ball, and England will have had just one session with the ball under lights before play starts.

Broad’s new-ball partner Jimmy Anderson may be slightly better prepared, having taken two wickets for Lancashire with the pink ball in a one-off round of County Championship matches in a trial of its use earlier this season.

The experiment received a mixed reception, with some players reporting that the ball went soft earlier than its red equivalent.

While red balls are dyed, waxed and lacquered, white and pink balls rely on paint to provide colour. The demands on pink balls, which must last 80 overs, are much greater than those on white balls, which are used for shorter forms of the game.

Manufacturers say the new balls should be easier to pick up in all conditions and England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow said on Tuesday that fielding sides may benefit. “With a red ball it is not perfect, to be quite honest,” he said.

“If you are stood at second slip, third slip, gully, point, fine leg, deep backward square, you are actually picking a maroon ball up out of a multi-coloured background, which is the crowd,” he told Sky Sports on Tuesday.

“You never know, coming out of a dark background, it might actually be easier to see a luminous pink ball than it would a gloomy red one. I am sure it will be a learning curve, for the batters and the bowlers ”

The Edgbaston game will be cricket’s fifth day-night test, but the first played with a Dukes ball, the make traditionally used in England.

The other four tests – three in Australia and one in Dubai – all used a Kookaburra, and the rival manufacturers fought their own battle this week over the merits of their respective balls.

“This (day-night test) is an experiment and people will expect miracles, but I think you have to give it a bit of time,” Dukes owner Dilip Jadojia told the Independent news site. “I think the colour is perfect, but if there are lessons to be learnt then they’ll be learnt.”

Mayweather and McGregor will fight in smaller gloves,"The bout is set to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on August 26. (Source: Reuters) The bout is set to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on August 26. (Source: Reuters)

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor will fight with smaller gloves, though not nearly as small as the ones McGregor is used to wearing.

Nevada boxing regulators on Wednesday gave the two fighters an exemption to a rule requiring 10-ounce gloves, approving 8-ounce gloves for the Aug. 26 bout. Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada Athletic Commission to request the waiver.

Commissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.

Under Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.

Commission Chairman Anthony Marnell led the way in approving the smaller gloves, but not before chastising the two camps for using the issue as a pawn in social media to try and sell tickets for the event.

Suresh Raina’s trainer from Amsterdam to be part of UPCA,"Suresh Raina will soon begin preparing for the domestic season with UP team. (Source: Instagram) Suresh Raina will soon begin preparing for the domestic season with UP team. (Source: Instagram)

Suresh Raina has had numerous practice stints in Amsterdam to stay fit and keep himself ready for the rigorous duties of the domestic cricket or when the opportunity to play for India comes up. But, for now, the second one looks a distant possibility having been overlooked for the ODI and T20 series against Sri Lanka. His last ODI came in October, 2015 while he played a T20I after, in February this year, against England.

The left handed middle order batsman was training at the National Cricket Academy until recently while remaining hopeful of a berth in the India squad for Sri Lanka but with that not happening, Raina will switch his attention to getting ready for the domestic season with Uttar Pradesh. And to stay fit and healthy, Raina can bank on the experienced trainers who he had been working with in Amsterdam. The season begins with the All India Buchi Babu Cricket Tournament.

“With the new season around the corner, I am determined, hungry and eager to play the highest form of the game for India,” the 28-year-old Raina had told PTI. “It is wonderful to be able to train with total intensity with the Dutch national team since I want to hit the ground running when the domestic season starts with a series of tournaments across the country in Chennai, Chandigarh and Hyderabad,” he said.

In a picture shared on Instagram, Raina and the rest of the staff dined ahead of the upcoming season. He wrote, “Looking forward to the @upcacricket camp starting tomorrow. Very excited to have @behrooz.9 and @hng.nguyen onboard for training the team and bringing the complete fitness regime from #Amsterdam to all the way in #Kanpur. Thank you so much @rajeevshuklaoffl for having this all organised and making it possible. #FitTeam #FocusedTeam #Camp #cricket #Kanpur #UPCA #GreenPark #ranjitrophy #firstclassseason #Excited #committed”.

"As NAFTA talks begin, Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda looms large","US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP Photo)

As the United States, Canada and Mexico kick off negotiations on Wednesday to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, the biggest uncertainty is whether a deal can pass President Donald Trump’s “America First” test. Trump has blamed NAFTA for shuttering U.S. factories and sending U.S. jobs to low-wage Mexico. The test will be whether negotiators can prove that a new NAFTA agreement can alter that course. The call from the U.S. business community in the run-up to the talks has been “do no harm” amid concerns that a new agreement will unravel a complex North American network of manufacturing suppliers built around NAFTA.

Trump, who made trade a centerpiece of his presidential campaign as he promised to reinvigorate the manufacturing sector, pulled the United States out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact shortly after taking office in January. But he has since backed off other trade threats, including declaring China a currency manipulator and tearing up NAFTA, which he regularly calls a disaster.

U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade has quadrupled since NAFTA took effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015.

Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington who was involved in the first NAFTA negotiations, said that in the previous NAFTA talks there was a political commitment from all sides to reach a deal. That is not the case now, he said.

“The question … is, What will Trump accept as a success in these negotiations?” said Burney. “To me that is the biggest wild card of all.” Robert Holleyman, a former deputy U.S. trade representative during the Obama administration, said the “toughest nut to crack” in the talks will be whether changes meet Trump’s goals to reduce the $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.

“We know where he wants to make changes to NAFTA. Whether those changes lead up to something that actually reduces the trade deficit with Mexico is wholly unclear,” Holleyman said.

NAFTA renegotiations will be a major test of Trump’s ability to meet his campaign promises to restore U.S. manufacturing jobs. Although he has inherited a strong economy that has added 1.29 million jobs this year, his promises of an ambitious legislative agenda have been derailed by the failure of a healthcare bill and the lack of a detailed plan for tax reform.

Weighing heavily over the talks is the upcoming 2018 Mexico presidential election. Mexico has urged all sides to complete the negotiations before the campaign ramps up in February to avoid it becoming a political punching bag.

AN “AMBITIOUS” FIRST ROUND

This week’s talks will be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo. Each side is expected to make remarks at the start of the talks being held at a historic Washington hotel.

The first round of meetings, which is expected to last until Sunday, will largely be administrative and focus on merging proposed texts from all three sides, according to a senior U.S. trade official, speaking to reporters on the eve of the talks.

The official said the sides were aiming for an “ambitious” first round of talks.

The United States has made lowering the $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with Mexico its top priority in the NAFTA talks, although trade experts argue that such a goal will not be achieved through trade deals but rather by boosting savings.

It also wants to strengthen NAFTA’s rules of origin, which specify how much of a product’s components must originate from NAFTA countries.

One of the most contentious issues in the talks is likely to be over the “Chapter 19” mechanism requiring the use of binational panels to settle anti-dumping and anti-subsidy disputes, which the Trump administration wants to eliminate because the rulings often go against the United States.

Canada’s Freeland suggested on Monday that Canada would walk away from the talks if the United States insisted on scrapping the mechanism.

Mexico has said its NAFTA goals are free access for goods and services, greater labor market integration and a strengthening of energy security.

Taramani review: This Andrea Jeramiah film deserves to be watched,"Despite its shortcomings, Taramani has a lot working in its favour. Despite its shortcomings, Taramani has a lot working in its favour.

Taramani movie cast: Andrea Jeremiah, Vasanth Ravi, Anjali

Taramani movie director: Ram

Taramani movie rating: 3.5

There is a Tamil phrase that Director Ram uses in the movie — “Mozhangalukum mottai mandaikum mudichu podrathu”. It indicates an unlikely relationship between two things at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The love story in Taramani’s is a bit like that. On one hand we have the stylish, sophisticated, modern Althiya Joseph (Andrea Jeramiah) and on the other there is the conventional Prabhunath (Vasanth Ravi) who is new to city and its urbane culture. Taramani follows Altheya and Prabhu capturing the multi-edged intricacies in contemporary romance through their stories.

Taramani is complex, heavy and a tad along. But at the same time it is also empowering. The movie demolishes every kind of stereotype out there – at times with subtlety and at times through a loudspeaker. The beauty of Taramani’s script does not lie in the pronounced moments but in the small things; like when Althea finds her husband with someone; little do we expect him to be homosexual. Similarly, when her five-year-old son is seen with a white stick like thing in his mouth, we are almost certain that it is a cigarette (Althea drinks and smokes, what else would it be?) — only to find out that it is a lollipop. Many such ‘expectations’ are pleasantly broken and that makes Taramani enormously effective.

We also have the loud reminders that this is a man’s world. After a break up, a colleague invites Altheya to a party. When she refuses, the colleague asks “are men the only people allowed to drink after a break up?” Altheya smiles for an instant, realising that she was momentarily lost in a stereotype herself. Though overdone at places, these clichéd lines work due to its relatability.

For a film that has been in the making for three years, Taramani feels fresh – thanks to Director Ram’s voiceovers and dialogues. Witty and powerful, it is his narrative that keeps you engrossed through the movie’s length. There is a sequence where Prabhu returns some cash to a lady in thousand rupee notes. As Prabhu leaves, a voice over says demonetisation was announced that night and we do not know if the woman managed to get the notes exchanged, ending it cheekily with a ‘Jai Hind’. His satirical political/social comments provide much needed relief to the intensity on screen and also save the movie from feeling dated.

Vasanth Ravi gives an impressive debut as Prabhu but Andrea steals the show with a remarkably understated performance. As an independent single mother, her portrayal is rooted in reality. It is also a small delight to hear the English dialogues sound natural and not contrived, as it is generally in Kollywood.

The movie, however, does lose its focus a bit in the middle and takes its own time to get back on track. The staging and the cinematography is unimpressive while the music works in patches. A few story arcs are fantastical. It would have more emphatic had it been streamlined a bit, it tries to say too much. Also, for a story that doesn’t really ‘judge’ anyone, the male lead gets a character certificate too many times.

But despite its flaws, Taramani’s voice is genuine; and for that, the movie deserves to be watched.

PMPML’s latest steps draw fire from commuters,"Mundhe said the decisions “were taken in the interest of commuters and PMPML’ Mundhe said the decisions “were taken in the interest of commuters and PMPML’

AlREADY under fire from commuters for doing little to encourage them to use PMPML buses, the transport body on Wednesday took several steps that further angered the commuters. It decided to increase the monthly pass rate by 17 per cent, hike the fine for ticketless travel by Rs 200 and scrap the weekly pass plan. “There is something wrong with the… PMPML. It has been continuously taking anti-commuter decisions,” said Jugal Rathi, who heads the PMP Pravasi Manch, a commuters’ organisation. However, Mundhe said all the decisions “were taken in the interest of commuters and the PMPML”.

Rathi pointed out that the organisation had earlier supported the efforts being made by PMPML chief Tukaram Mundhe to ensure discipline in the transport body’s functioning and crack the whip against errant employees. However, Rathi said the three decisions announced today, and an earlier one about increasing the daily pass rate from Rs 50 to Rs 70, would only discourage commuters from using PMPML buses and force them to take private vehicles.

“As per my information, 35,000 commuters were using daily passes before the hike. After the hike, the number of daily pass commuters have reduced to 15,000,” he said.

Rathi claimed the three decisions announced by Mundhe on Wednesday would also hit the commuters hard.

“Why has the PMPML increased the monthly pass rate from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,400? In fact, the rate should have been reduced so that more and more commuters can use PMPML. If using PMPML buses becomes costlier, people will opt for private vehicles, which will further clog the already clogged Pune roads,” he said.

Rishikesh Marale (21), a Puneite, said, “I was thinking of giving up my two-wheeler because of the increasing number of two-wheeler accidents on city roads. But this news, about the PMPML hiking pass rates, is certainly discouraging”.

On the transport body’s decision to increase the fine amount from Rs 100 to Rs 300 for ticketless travellers, another commuter said, “Every day, I travel by PMPML buses and every day, there are arguments on board the buses. This is because ticket checkers rush inside the jam-packed buses… when a commuter has not even travelled one kilometre… and the conductor has not reached him. This leads to arguments on buses. A commuter should be fined only when he deboards the bus without a ticket…”.

Rathi said the PMPML has closed down several pass centres as well. “… They are making pass centres inaccessible. At least 15 pass centres have been shut down,” he said.

Explaining the steps taken by PMPML, Mundhe said, “The earlier decision regarding increasing the pass rate from Rs 50 to Rs 70 and the latest decision, to increase the monthly pass rate, brings some kind of parity… For instance, if a commuter uses a daily pass of Rs 70 for 30 days, the amount comes to Rs 2,100, which showed the wide gap with the Rs 1,200 monthly pass plan”.

Mundhe also denied the claim that the number of daily pass users had gone down drastically after the hike.

“By 6 pm today, we have over 19,000 daily pass users…the conclusions drawn by the commuter body are wrong,” he said. Mundhe also supported the decision to increase the fine amount, saying it would act as a deterrent to those who “deceive PMPML”.

On pass centres being shut down, he said centres that had only a few commuters had been shut down.

“All the decisions are taken in the interest of commuters and the PMPML. We have to look after the needs of PMPML buses and its staff as well,” said Mundhe.

"Apologise to salesman for wrongful arrest, Delhi court tells police","The policemen claimed that though they had passed on the instructions, it was not complied with. The policemen claimed that though they had passed on the instructions, it was not complied with.

Law calls upon the state to provide monetary compensation in cases of illegal detention by police. However, a city court has gone a step further and asked Delhi Police to tender a written apology to a salesman who was wrongfully arrested by its personnel.

Surender Kumar, who was a salesman at a footwear showroom in Shakthi Nagar — within the limits of Roop Nagar police station — was arrested for not complying with a police circular to install a CCTV camera in the shop. However, the court said it was the showroom owner and not the salesman who was required to carry out the instructions.

Discharging Kumar, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Dharmender Rana awarded him a compensation of Rs 28,800 and asked the DCP (north) to tender a written apology. “In order to win back the confidence of victim Surender in the established institutions of this great democratic nation, this court would prefer to move a step ahead of the traditional approach of awarding only monetary compensation… This court is of the considered opinion that… a written apology from the district head of police, i.e. DCP North, acknowledging follies of his subordinates… would go a long way in not only healing the wounds of the victim but also upholding the cherished motto ‘Shanti Seva Nyaya’ of Delhi Police”, the order said.

Of the compensation amount, Rs 27,800 was awarded under Section 250 CRPC as the court found no ground for the accusations against Kumar. The court said this will be borne equally by the personnel concerned — ASI Kesar Singh, SHO Roop Nagar, Inspector Ram Niwas and ACP Niyati Mittal Kashyap. Rs 1,000 was awarded under Section 358 for groundless arrest. This will be shared by ASI Singh and the SHO, the court said, adding that the amount will be deducted from their salary.

The matter pertains to a circular issued by ACP Sarai Rohilla on June 28, 2016, “making it obligatory upon owner of any commercial establishment… to install good quality CCTV cameras… within a period of two months from the date of publication of said notification”.

The policemen claimed that though they had passed on the instructions, it was not complied with.

Kumar was charged under IPC Section 188, arrested and granted bail. But the court found that the said circular imposed the obligation on the “owner”. “The difficulty in detection of the real culprit would not grant a license to… nab a poor salesman, who, owing to his professional constraints and socio-economic status, assumes silence about his employer’s misdeeds…,” the court said, censuring police.

Britain’s most advanced and biggest warship, the 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, berthed for the first time at its home port of Portsmouth on Wednesday. The 280-metre (920-foot) vessel entered the harbour on England’s southern coast at 0610 GMT, greeted by thousands of spectators. HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy, according to the Ministry of Defence.

“Today we welcome our mighty new warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to her home for the very first time,” said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. “She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role.”

The ship is currently undergoing sea trials. It cannot yet deploy planes, but flying trials from its deck are due to begin in 2018. It took eight years to build HMS Queen Elizabeth, with construction taking place in six cities and involving 10,000 people.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in says no military action without Seoul’s consent,"South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. (Source: File) South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. (Source: File)

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday there will be no military action upon the Korean peninsula without Seoul’s consent and that the government would prevent war by all means. “Military action on the Korean peninsula can only be decided by South Korea and no one else can decide to take military action without the consent of South Korea,” said Moon in televised comments. The president was making an annual speech to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the nation’s liberation from Japanese military rule that began in 1910 and ended in 1945.

“The government, putting everything on the line, will block war by all means,” Moon said.

Previous presidents before Moon, who took office in May, have traditionally made North Korea the core of their speeches, mainly focusing on policy to engage Pyongyang.

Moon also urged the North to come to the dialogue table, saying sanctions against Pyongyang aim only draw it out to talks.

“I call upon the North Korean government: without international cooperation and co-existence economic development is impossible,” said Moon. “If you continue on this path there will only be international isolation and a dark future.”

Tension on the Korean peninsula has increased in recent months over concern that North Korea is close to achieving its goal of putting the mainland United States within range of a nuclear weapon.

North Korea and the United States exchanged threats of military action last week, with Pyongyang saying it will develop a plan to fire missiles to land in waters near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.

Earlier on Tuesday, North Korea said it would keep fire-ready regarding its Guam plans while watching the actions of the United States for a while longer.

"Taiwan suffers massive power cut, affecting millions of households","Power had been fully restored across the island by Wednesday, local media said. (Source: Google Maps) Power had been fully restored across the island by Wednesday, local media said. (Source: Google Maps)

Taiwan suffered a massive power blackout on Tuesday evening that hit businesses and residential homes, affecting close to seven million households on the heavily industrialised island amid sweltering heat. The outage left millions of homes without power and hit offices and factories on the island of nearly 24 million people, but appeared to have a limited impact on businesses, including some of the world’s leading technology manufacturers.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple Inc, said its operations were not affected, as did electronics manufacturer Pegatron Corp. ChipMOS Technologies Inc said the outage had not had a big impact on its operations. Its shares fell 2 percent in early trade, lagging a flat broader market.

Power had been fully restored across the island by Wednesday, local media said. Residents complained as temperatures hovered around 32 degrees Celsius (89.6°F), while the blackout caused havoc as restaurants and small businesses were left without power, traffic lights stopped working and elevators stalled.

The power outage was caused by a human technical error at state-owned gas supplier CPC Corp that affected the operations of a state-owned Taiwan Power Co power plant in northwestern Taoyuan, the two companies said at a news conference on Tuesday evening. Taiwan Power Co’s outage at its Taoyuan plant caused six generators to stop working, resulting in a massive blackout across Taiwan, the company said.

President Tsai Ing-wen apologised on her Facebook page for the blackout, describing electricity supply as a national security issue. Relevant government departments needed to quickly explain why a single event could cause such large damage across the country’s electricity system, she said. “We must reform the system. I will make this an important point for thorough inspection reforms in the future.”

Taiwan’s Minister of Economics Affairs Chih-Kung Lee had offered to resign over the incident, which was accepted by Premier Lin Chuan, the government said. Lee’s formal resignation letter was expected later this week, it said. If Lee steps down as expected, he will do so just over a year after assuming office.

CPC Corp said it accepted responsibility for the outage and was investigating the cause. The blackout was the country’s most severe since the 1999 Jiji earthquake, Taiwan Power Co said.

"Indian men’s hockey team beat Netherlands 2-1, win series","India straightaway sought to put pressure on the home team and the positive intent worked. (Source: Hockey India Release) India straightaway sought to put pressure on the home team and the positive intent worked. (Source: Hockey India Release)

Gurjant Singh and Mandeep Singh scored a goal apiece as a resolute Indian men’s hockey team overcome world No. 4 Netherlands 2-1 in an exciting encounter in Amsterdam.

Led by Manpreet Singh, the team last night featured nine players from the junior team, but still, beat an experienced Netherlands squad through goals from Gurjant (4th minute) and Mandeep (51).

India, thus, won the three-match series. India straightaway sought to put pressure on the home team and the positive intent worked as they drew first blood through a penalty corner awarded in the fourth minute.

While it was Varun Kumar who attempted the drag flick which was padded away by the Dutch keeper, Gurjant was quick to pick up the rebound and work his reverse stick magic to put the ball high up into the net and score his first international goal for the men’s side.

India continued the strong attack as they made forays into the striking circle. Armaan Qureshi made a great attempt to take India’s lead to 2-0 with a shot on goal but it went slightly wide.

Though the Dutch tried to make amends when they won a penalty corner in the early minutes of the second quarter, the flick was brilliantly saved by India goalkeeper Akash Chikte. That didn’t deter the Dutch side who attempted a full press and even put India under pressure by winning three more PCs, but they could not make the opportunities count with Chikte staying up to the challenge.

With a 1-0 lead, the third quarter saw Netherlands make desperate attempts to come back into the game but India absorbed the pressure well, only to execute a stronger defensive structure that kept the Dutch from scoring.

The final 15 minutes saw India increase their intensity in attack with Gurjant winning a PC, but it was saved. The following minute saw Sumit win a PC for India, and this time they tried a different variation that worked like magic with striker Mandeep deflecting into the goal to double

India’s lead to 2-0.

Soon after, the Dutch won a PC but debutant goalkeeper Suraj Karkera was up to the task to defend. With final three minutes remaining, Dutch forwards made three strong shots on goal but an alert Karkera kept them from converting. However, Saander de Wijn through a PC scored in the 58th minute but that didn’t stop India from walking away with a 2-1 win.

“I think we played well in all departments to win against the Netherlands. They are a very experienced team with more than eight players with over 100 International Caps. So, to beat them we had to come up with something special.

“I am very happy with the way the entire team performed as one unit especially the players making their debut. They showed no sign of nervousness and played with a lot of confidence,” said an elated skipper Manpreet after the series win.

CAG offers Bofors files for review: MoD to House panel,"The source said that the government told the PAC that it would collect all reports related to the issue and get back to the panel with its response. The source said that the government told the PAC that it would collect all reports related to the issue and get back to the panel with its response.

The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has told the Defence Ministry that it may come and scrutinise 30 volumes of its files related to the Bofors gun deal, Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra told the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday, sources said.

The Defence Secretary, consequently, has asked for a month’s time to return to the PAC to submit Action Taken Notes (ATN) on two paragraphs of the CAG report that had highlighted alleged irregularities in the purchase of the guns.

Incidentally, the Ministry hasn’t submitted the ATN to the PAC in the last 27 years since the CAG report was made public in 1990 — an issue on which PAC member BJP leader Nishikant Dubey as well as sub-committee chairman BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab had repeatedly questioned the Defence Ministry.

“The question that was asked today to the Defence Secretary was that when will they submit the ATNs. The Defence Secretary sought time till mid-September. The ministry had earlier sought time till mid- August,” said a source.

The source said that the government told the PAC that it would collect all reports related to the issue and get back to the panel with its response.

The sub-committee, which has no Congress member, had taken up the issue around two months ago and sought the ministry’s response on Para 11 of CAG report of 1989 and Para 9 of CAG report of 1990 on which the ministry had not submitted ATNs for last 27 years.

When the government argued that it didn’t have the relevant files to respond to these paras and suggested that the paras should be omitted from the record, an apparently irked PAC asked the Ministry to explore options to access the related files.

As the issue has repeatedly been raised by the PAC sub panel, bringing the focus back on the three-decade-old controversy, a section in the Congress has voiced its displeasure — the PAC is headed by senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.

The question on the Bofors issue came up towards the end of the meeting whose listed agenda was presentations by the Defence Ministry on the issue of non-compliance of ATN on the review of procurement for the Kargil war based on a 2001 CAG report.

Suspected Islamist militants kill 18 in attack on Burkina Faso restaurant,"Burkina Faso has been targeted sporadically by jihadist groups operating across Africa’s Sahel. (Source: Reuters) Burkina Faso has been targeted sporadically by jihadist groups operating across Africa’s Sahel. (Source: Reuters)

Suspected jihadists killed at least 18 people and wounded several during a raid on a restaurant in Burkina Faso’s capital overnight but security forces shot dead both attackers and freed people trapped inside the building. “This is a terrorist attack,” Communications Minister Remi Dandjinou told a news conference on Monday. He said the toll was provisional because the security operation was still underway.

Burkina Faso, like other countries in West Africa, has been targeted sporadically by jihadist groups operating across Africa’s Sahel. Most attacks have been along its remote northern border region with Mali, which has seen attacks by Islamist militants for more than a decade. A Reuters witness saw customers running out of the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in central Ouagadougou as police and paramilitary gendarmerie surrounded it amid gunfire.

A woman said she was in the restaurant celebrating her brother’s birthday when the shooting started. “I just ran but my brother was left inside,” the woman told Reuters TV as she fled the building.

Earlier, authorities had suggested that three assailants had been killed, but the minister later revised down that figure and gave the death toll of victims as 18. Thirty people were killed when gunmen attacked a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in an incident claimed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). AQIM and related Islamist groups were largely confined to the Sahara desert until they hijacked a Tuareg rebellion in Mali in 2012 and swept south. French forces intervened to prevent them taking Mali’s capital, Bamako, the following year, but they have since gradually expanded their reach, launching high-profile attacks on Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.

A new al Qaeda-linked alliance of Malian jihadist groups claimed an attack in June that killed at least five people at a luxury Mali resort popular with Western expatriates just outside Bamako. African nations launched a new multinational military force to tackle Islamist militants in the Sahel last month, but it will not be operational until later this year and faces a budget shortfall.

At least 37 die in jail riot in southern Venezuela,"At least 37 people died in an hours-long jail riot in Venezuela’s southern state of Amazonas, officials have said. The prosecutors’ office said an investigation had been launched into “the deaths of 37 people” in the facility in the town of Puerto Ayacucho. Governor Liborio Guarulla had earlier tweeted that a “massacre” took place with at least 35 corpses counted. Prosecutors said 14 officials were wounded in the violence which ran from Tuesday into early yesterday, but did not say if any were among the dead.

Two prison-monitoring groups, A Window to Freedom and the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory, said the 37 killed were all inmates. “This is the worst riot we’ve had in a preventative detention facility,” Carlos Nieto of A Window to Freedom told AFP. “In this one, detainees are only supposed to be held for up to 48 hours, but there were prisoners who have been there for years,” he said. The jail was holding 105 prisoners at the time of the riot, Guarulla said.

The deadliest riot in a prison in Venezuela was in 2013, when 60 people died and more than 150 were wounded in a facility in Uribana, in the western state of Lara. At the end of last year, the country had 88,000 detainees, more than double the official holding capacity of 35,000 places, according to A Window to Freedom. So some 33,000 convicted prisoners were being kept in preventative centres like the one in Puerto Ayacucho, alongside people awaiting trial, Nieto said.

Britain seeks Brexit without borders for Northern Ireland,"There should be no border posts between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, Britain said in an early attempt to resolve one of the most complex aspects of its European Union exit. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File There should be no border posts between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, Britain said in an early attempt to resolve one of the most complex aspects of its European Union exit. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File

There should be no border posts between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, Britain said in an early attempt to resolve one of the most complex aspects of its European Union exit. Some 30,000 people cross the 500 kilometre border every day without customs or immigration checks, testing negotiators who have to work out how to tighten controls without inflaming tensions in a region where around 3,600 people were killed before a peace agreement in 1998.

The British government said in a paper due to be published on Wednesday that it wanted a seamless and frictionless frontier without “physical border infrastructure and border posts”, arguing that new customs arrangements it proposed on Tuesday would allow the free flow of goods.

The issue of how the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will fare is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence over whether it should be part of Britain or Ireland.

“Both sides needs to show flexibility and imagination when it comes to the border issue in Northern Ireland,” a British government source said.

Britain put forward two options for future customs arrangements with the EU on Tuesday, the first would involve no customs border at all, while a second detailed ‘highly-streamlined’ customs checks.

However, the idea met with scepticism among some of Britain’s soon-to-be former EU partners, with one EU official describing the idea of an invisible border as ‘fantasy’.

“We have some very clear principles. Top of our list is to agree upfront no physical border infrastructure — that would mean a return to the border posts of the past and is completely unacceptable to the UK,” the British source said.

FRICTIONLESS TRADE?

The EU has repeatedly warned that Britain cannot expect to maintain the benefits of the European single market after Brexit, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier saying in July that “frictionless trade” with the EU was not possible.

However, the British government also said it wants to maintain a Common Travel Area, a pact that allows free movement between the United Kingdom and Ireland for British and Irish citizens.

And it rejected the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea that separates England, Wales and Scotland from Ireland and Northern Ireland as “not constitutionally or economically viable.”

Northern Ireland sold 2.7 billion pounds ($3.47 billion) of goods into Ireland in 2015, according to official figures, and many businesses have complex supply chains that involve crossing the border multiple times during the production process.

Commenting on the advance briefing of the position paper, the Irish government said it was “timely and helpful” and that it hoped enough progress could be made to move talks forward.

“Protecting the Peace Process is crucial and it must not become a bargaining chip in the negotiations,” the Irish government said in a statement, in reference to the Good Friday Agreement which was signed on April 10, 1998 after multi-party talks and led to the creation of an elected assembly in Belfast.

The border is one of three priority issues that the EU is insisting must be dealt with during the opening rounds of talks before moving on to Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.

The first two rounds of divorce talks in Brussels have made limited progress, prompting the EU to warn the next phase – which Britain is keen to get to – could be delayed unless Prime Minister Theresa May’s team come armed with more detail.

But pro-EU campaign group Open Britain said the government’s proposal lacked specifics.

“They don’t outline how a frictionless or seamless border can be achieved when the UK leaves the EU and won’t reassure anybody about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland,” Labour Party lawmaker Conor McGinn said.

"Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani theft: Cash and valuables worth lakhs stolen, passengers are suspects","Thieves are suspected to have got off at Ratlam. (Source: File photo) Thieves are suspected to have got off at Ratlam. (Source: File photo)

They struck some time in the dead of the night, after the clock had ticked over from Tuesday to Wednesday. By 5.30 am, as some passengers on the August Kranti Rajdhani from Mumbai to Delhi, woke up near Kota in Rajasthan, it was all over.

In one of the most high-profile cases of train theft in recent years, cash and valuables worth lakhs were stolen from around 20 passengers on the Rajdhani by thieves who, police suspect, were travelling in the train as bona fide, ticket-holding passengers.

According to a preliminary assessment by Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP), the thieves are suspected to have got going after the train had crossed Vadodara at around 10.30 pm and most of the passengers had fallen asleep.

Based on passengers’ accounts, investigators have concluded that the thieves completed the job near Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh between 2 am and 3 am — Ratlam is the only stop for the train between Vadodara and Kota.

Officials said the train was being escorted by three RPF constables that night. The thefts took place in AC-2 and AC-3 coaches of the train, which has 11 halts between Mumbai and Delhi.

“There was no chain-pulling, which is what local gangs do to flee after stealing. Plus, the circumstances in which empty wallets were found point towards bona-fide passengers who did the job with ample time in hand,” a senior RPF official told The Indian Express. Some empty wallets were recovered from toilets and vestibules.

“We have tried to zero down on certain possibilities of the case. In past cases, involvement of the catering staff has been witnessed, either partly or completely. We have taken statements from the staff present inside the train,” said Rajinder Malik, Chief Security Commissioner, Jabalpur, West Central Railway. Malik ruled out the possibility of the passengers having been drugged by the robbers.

Investigators are also studying case histories of crime incidents on this route over the last 18 months to see if there is a pattern.

While a group of passengers got off in Mathura, 11 passengers filed separate FIRs at the GRP station at the Nizamuddin station in Delhi.

According to these FIRs, cash worth Rs 2.5 lakh, apart from gold jewellery, six mobile phones, credit and debit cards, PAN and Aadhaar cards and passports were among the items stolen. One passenger claimed to have been carrying Rs 1.25 lakh in cash.

“My wife’s wallet is missing. It had Rs 21,400 in cash, a mobile phone, Aadhaar card, house keys and other important things,” said Ramesh Kalra, who had boarded the train with his wife in Borivali.

“We lost at least Rs 15,000 in cash and other belongings. We were part of a group of 13 heading towards Mathura for a religious visit. Most of our belongings were stolen from the section in which the women with us were travelling,” said Piyush Singh, a resident of Bhayander.

“Cash worth Rs 15,000 along with mobile phones and debit cards of my mother have been stolen. We have registered a case,” said Aklam Shaikh, from Mira Road.

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said these incidents have been happening for years. “These crimes have been taking place for years, and now they have come down. But we are trying to make things more secure for passengers by installing CCTV cameras in coaches,” said Prabhu.

According to official figures, there has been a 33 per cent increase in theft of passengers’ belongings in the Railways system when compared to last year. Between January to June this year, there have been 12,573 such cases, compared to 9,436 during the same period last year.

In this case, the GRP in Nizamuddin has lodged FIRs under Section 380 of the IPC, which deals with theft, punishable with imprisonment up to seven years and a fine. The FIRs have been transferred to the Ratlam GRP.

Earlier this year, a woman travelling in the same train had accused a catering staff of stealing her jewellery. The RPF has constituted a three-member team to assist the state police forces of three states in the probe.

However, going by past record, these investigations get stuck for months due to disputes between states and even districts within a state over jurisdiction.

The Railways has maintained that since law and order is a state subject, the RPF patrolling of a running train is deployed as per inputs from states and past trends.

The Railways is planning to launch upgraded services of Rajdhanis and Shatabdis from October with CCTV cameras on coaches — but not all coaches will have the facility, to begin with.

The West Bengal administration on Wednesday confirmed that as many as 32 people have died across six districts in North Bengal in flood-related incidents, two of snake bite while the rest drowned, since July 21.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh for each of the dead. Government sources told The Indian Express that the floods were caused due to “holding water” from overflowing rivers in neighbouring Bhutan, Bihar and Jharkhand, and not rain.

Meanwhile, officials of the disaster management department confirmed that as many as 14 lakh people have been affected across the flood-hit districts. Speaking to The Indian Express, disaster management minister Javed Khan said that the situation in north Bengal “is still grim.” “There were very heavy rain in the entire region till late last night. Although the rains have eased a little today, it is still raining intermittently,” said Khan, adding that the government had launched rescue operations in North Bengal on a war footing. Malda, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri and parts of Cooch Behar are some of the worst affected. “Boats have been provided there.”

Malda Magistrate Kaushik Bhattacharya said that six blocks —Harishchandrapur I and II blocks, Bamangola block, Chanchal I and II blocks and Nathua block I — were badly affected. “We have evacuated 30,000 people so far to 30 relief camps,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mamata on Wednesday said that the government’s priority right now was to ensure rescue operations were efficient. On August 10, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy, in Parliament, had alleged discrimination on the part of the Centre in Parliament alleging that relief funds had not been given to West Bengal. Union Minister of State Kiren Rijiju had countered saying the Centre had not received documents of estimates of losses from the state.

“I believe that some people have accused us of not submitting estimates.

We had only just begun drawing up estimates of losses incurred by the floods in West Bengal when we were hit by the floods in North Bengal. Now we are in rescue mode. We have not calculated the exact losses incurred by the state,” said Mamata. “Our first priority is to rescue those affected by the floods. The estimates will be made after the water recedes.”

She said she had already appraised the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister of the situation.

The North East Frontier Railways, meanwhile, cancelled nine trains to the regions as the lines were submerged.

“Railway officials have told me that it will take at least two weeks to get these lines operational. I have directed them to do this sooner. I was once rail minister and know the Railways has the infrastructure and manpower to handle these situations,” said Mamata.

CPM politburo member Mohammad Salim, who rushed to his constituency and flood affected area of Raiganj in North Dinajpur Tuesday, however contended that his area had not received any relief.

“Thousands of people have been affected in my area. There has been no relief sent the past four days and there is no sign of the state administration here. I have personally been to seven homes today where there have been deaths. Out of the nine blocks in Uttar Dinajpur, five have been severely affected and four partially – in three blocks the water is still rising. People are just fending for themselves. They have asked for boats but even these have not been provided,” he alleged.

Govt to conduct assessment of learning outcomes on November 13,"HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar. (Express photo) HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar. (Express photo)

THE UNION government will conduct its first country-wide assessment of learning achievements on November 13 in which over 30 lakh school students of Classes III, V and VIII in 35,000 government schools will participate. This will be the world’s largest sample survey of learning outcomes, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a meeting with state governments on Wednesday.

Learning outcomes are assessment standards, which help teachers to understand the learning levels of students in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Earlier this year, the Union government amended the rules under Right to Education (RTE) Act, making it compulsory for all state governments to codify expected levels of learning which students in Classes I to VIII should achieve in different subjects.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has drafted learning indicators for eight subjects — English, Hindi, Urdu, Mathematics, EVS (Environmental Science), Science and Social Sciences — based on which states can finalise their own indicators.

For instance, as per the NCERT document, learning indicators in writing for a Class I student will assess not just the student’s ability to recognise letters A to Z, but also her ability to carry out simple instructions such as ‘shut the door’, ‘bring me the book’. In Class II, a student should be able to compose and write simple, short sentences with space between words. The levels gradually increase so that by Class VIII, a student cannot only read and write, but also use his or her faculties to read between the lines, understand new concepts and explore and read other areas of knowledge.

The learning outcome test on November 13 is being conducted to implement the amendment of Rule 23 (2) of the RTE Act. The National Achievement Survey or NAS, which is being held since 2001, has been tweaked by the NCERT to now test a student’s competency instead of her knowledge of the school curriculum. Also, earlier only 4.5 lakh students across Classes III, V and VIII were being assessed through NAS. Starting this year, 30 lakh government schoolchildren will be tested.

“NAS will now produce district-wise comparison within each state as opposed to the state-to-state comparison that it is being doing since 2001. The learning outcome test will be administered in 19 languages and the government will propose short, mid-term and long-term interventions including policy changes to the state governments based on the results of this assessment,” NCERT director Hrushikesh Senapaty told The Indian Express.

On Wednesday, Javadekar held a meeting with all state government representatives via video conference to brief them about the learning outcome test in November. It will be a pen-and-paper test in which students will have to attempt multiple-choice questions. Student will have to fill in their choices in an OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheet which can be scanned for quick processing of results.

Iraq bombing IS-held Tal Afar ahead of assault: Iraqi military spokesperson,"Islamic State has also lost swathes of Syrian territory to separate campaigns being waged by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran and by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic (SDF) Forces, which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia. (Source: Reuters/ Representational) Islamic State has also lost swathes of Syrian territory to separate campaigns being waged by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran and by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic (SDF) Forces, which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia. (Source: Reuters/ Representational)

Iraqi forces are carrying out air strikes on Tal Afar, a town held by Islamic State west of Mosul, in preparation for a ground assault, an Iraqi military spokesman said on Tuesday. Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the recapture of Mosul, the militants’ capital in northern Iraq, after a nine-month campaign.

Parts of Iraq and Syria remain however under Islamic State control, especially along the border. Iraqi authorities had said Tal Afar, 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul, will be the next target in the war on Islamic State, who swept through parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014.

The town, which had about 200,000 residents before falling to Islamic State, experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi’ites after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has produced some of Islamic State’s most senior commanders. “The preparations are under way, there are strikes aimed at wearing them down and keeping them busy, targeting their command and control centers, their depots…these strikes have been going on for some time,” Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool said in a statement. “We are waiting for the commander in chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi)to give the orders for the liberation battle to start.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Baghdad-based al-Sumariya TV quoted Defence Ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Khodari as saying the ground attack should start after the aerial bombardment campaign. Tal Afar has become the focus of a wider regional struggle for influence. Turkey, which claims affinity with Tal Afar’s predominantly ethnic Turkmen population, opposes the involvement of Shi’ite paramilitary groups fighting with Iraqi forces, some of which are backed by Iran.

One of Iraq’s senior military commanders, Major-General Najm al-Jabouri, told Reuters last month that between 1,500 and 2,000 militants were in Tal Afar, a figure which possibly includes some family members who support them. The U.S.-led coalition is also keeping up its support to the Iraqi forces’ campaign to end the militants presence all over the country.

Coalition spokesman Colonel Ryad Dillon said last Thursday that the coalition carried out more than 50 strikes in the past week against Islamic State defensive positions, headquarters, weapons caches, and bomb factories in Tal Afar and also Kisik Junction to the east.

“We fully expect this to be a difficult fight to root out ISIS from one of their last strongholds in Iraq,” Dillon told a news briefing. Jabouri had a different assessment of the battle, expecting a relatively easy victory because the militants and their families there are “worn out and demoralised”.

Islamic State has also lost swathes of Syrian territory to separate campaigns being waged by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran and by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic (SDF) Forces, which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia. The SDF is currently focused on capturing Raqqa city from Islamic State.

Thousands of Brazilian police and soldiers have carried out a security operation near Rio de Janeiro as part of a crackdown aimed at curbing rising violence. Operation “Double Dose” focused on the Caramujo slum complex early Wednesday in the city of Niteroi, which neighbors Rio.

The Rio de Janeiro state government said in a statement that more than 3,000 police officers and soldiers were involved. They arrested 16 organized crime suspects and also seized tactical gear, radio transmitters and a small amount of drugs.

Violence has been on the rise in Rio since the end of the Olympics a year ago, with gangs operating in hundreds of slums. Last month the federal government deployed 8,500 soldiers to fight organized crime in Rio.

US Sikhs launch ad campaign to educate Americans about faith,"Sikhs wear turbans to show their willingness to serve others in the community and their commitment to equality for all people. (File/Photo) Sikhs wear turbans to show their willingness to serve others in the community and their commitment to equality for all people. (File/Photo)

A Sikh advocacy group in the US is set to launch an advertisement campaign on the national news channels as part an effort to help inform Americans about the minority community which has been facing a spate of racial attacks. The “We Are Sikhs” advertisement campaign will showcase Sikh Americans’ contributions to society and highlight the fact that Sikh values are American values, said Rajwant Singh, co-founder and senior advisor of the National Sikh Campaign. “Reaching out to all Americans is a critical component of the ‘We Are Sikhs’ initiative and placing our ads on the Fox News Channel will further our message to an important, conservative audience,” Rajwant said.

“We are working proactively to connect with our neighbours from all walks of life representing broad ideological and political views,” he said.

Singh said the Sikh community had been facing discrimination, intimidation, harassment and hate crimes since the 9/11 attacks largely because of a collective misunderstanding regarding the meaning of turban in Sikhism.

Sikhs wear turbans to show their willingness to serve others in the community and their commitment to equality for all people.

In an effort to reach conservative voters across the country, the advertisements will run on select Fox News programming from August 15 to August 31, a statement said.

There have been a number of attacks targeting Indian-Americans and Sikhs in the recent months in the US.

Two Sikh Americans were killed in separate incidents in California last month.

Subag Singh, 68, was found dead in a canal after he went missing on the morning of June 23 while Simranjit Singh, 20, of Elk Grove was shot dead outside a gas station where he worked.

Harkirat Singh, 25, an immigrant from Punjab who moved to the US three years ago, was assaulted and his turban knocked off by unruly passengers in New York in April.

In March, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted “go back to your own country”.

In February, 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed when a US Navy veteran opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani, yelling “get out of my country”.

Indian-American sentenced to 40 months in prison for fraud,"From January 2014 to early 2017, Nayee, who had previously pleaded guilty, conspired with others to defraud victims in an Internal Revenue Service impersonator impersonator scam, according to court documents. Representational Image From January 2014 to early 2017, Nayee, who had previously pleaded guilty, conspired with others to defraud victims in an Internal Revenue Service impersonator impersonator scam, according to court documents. Representational Image

An Indian-American man has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for cheating victims in a telephone fraud scheme, an official has said. Anandkumar Jayantila Nayee was held responsible for at least USD 150,000 in victim losses during the telephone fraud scheme, said Benjamin Greenberg, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.

From January 2014 to early 2017, Nayee, who had previously pleaded guilty, conspired with others to defraud victims in an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) impersonator impersonator scam, according to court documents. His co-conspirators contacted victims by telephone and made fraudulent representations to them, including that the victims owed income tax payments to the IRS or owed fees for grants or loans that they had purportedly received.

Nayee’s co-conspirators instructed the victims to deposit payments related to the taxes or fees that they purportedly owed onto debit cards and into bank accounts controlled by Nayee and his co-conspirators. Nayee and his co-conspirators then received and retained the victims’ payments, federal prosecutors alleged.

According to court papers, from January 2014 through February 28, 2014, a co-conspirator purchased Green Dot prepaid debit cards and provided the full debit card numbers to Nayee, who resided in India at the time. Nayee then caused the prepaid debit cards to be registered in the names of real people and notified his co-conspirator once the cards had been funded by victims of the telephone fraud scheme.

The co-conspirator then used the prepaid debit cards to purchase money orders and deposited the money orders into bank accounts specified by Nayee who had moved to Miami from India in 2015. He and his co-conspirators picked up funds that had been sent via money transfer by victims of the telephone fraud scheme and deposited those funds into accounts controlled by Nayee and his co-conspirators.

Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga calls strike as he mulls options,"Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, center, leaves in his vehicle surrounded by some thousands of supporters, after visiting the mother of a 9-year-old girl who was killed Saturday by a stray bullet during clashes between police and protesters, in the Mathare slum of Nairobi, Kenya Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)

Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga has urged his supporters to stay home from work on Monday to mourn those killed in protests over what he claims was a rigged election, while he mulls his next move. Government officials have urged citizens to return to work, after days of anxiety since last Tuesday’s election left Nairobi, a bustling city of more than three million people, near-deserted.

Yesterday, life appeared to slowly be returning to normal with businesses opening and deadly protests that erupted Friday night after the election result fizzling out as Odinga’s supporters await his next move. At least 16 people have died in protests in Odinga’s strongholds, according to an AFP tally, many shot dead by police.

“We are not done yet. We will not give up. Wait for the next course of action which I will announce the day after tomorrow (Tuesday),” Odinga told a crowd of thousands in Nairobi’s slum Kibera on Sunday. “Do not go to work tomorrow. Let us mourn the innocent people killed by police.” It was his first appearance since the election commission (IEBC) on Friday declared President Uhuru Kenyatta the victor of a vote that Odinga says was rigged.

The 72-year-old and his National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition believe he was the rightful winner, and that results which came in via an electronic tallying system were hacked and manipulated. Foreign observers praised election day as peaceful and credible and expressed confidence in the IEBC, but have not commented on the counting process.

The United Nations, Britain and the European Union have beseeched Odinga to send out a message to restrain his supporters from protesting, and instead use legal means to address his concerns. In asking his supporters to stay home, he also urged them to avoid police, but many are hanging on for instructions come Tuesday.

“It was quiet and we were worried, because we did not know the plan. Now, we’re very ready for whatever will come,” said Duncan Nyamo, an Odinga supporter in Kibera “We are ready to die.”

Politics in Kenya is largely divided along tribal lines, and the winner-takes-all nature of elections has long stoked communal divisions. Three of Kenya’s four presidents have been Kikuyu and the other Kalenjin, leaving Luos and other major ethnic groups feeling excluded from power and marginalised for over half a century. In 2007, Odinga and his allies claimed an election was stolen by Mwai Kibaki — a Kikuyu. Foreign observers agreed there had been irregularities.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Gujarat Fortunegiants come back from jaws of defeat against Bengaluru Bulls,"Manpreet credited the younger players of the team and Gujarat’s defensive setup for their win over Bulls. (Express Photo by Saundarya Mehra) Manpreet credited the younger players of the team and Gujarat’s defensive setup for their win over Bulls. (Express Photo by Saundarya Mehra)

In the last 10 minutes of their match against Bengaluru Bulls, Gujarat Fortunegiants showed that they have the caliber to trounce any team in the fifth season of the Pro Kabaddi. Gujarat are now on a four-match unbeaten streak and it has come about due to a rock-solid defence and the performances of their youngsters. One could easily make out from coach Manpreet Singh’s celebration just how pleased he was with his team’s efforts in their 27-24 win over Bengaluru Bulls. “This win is special as the team didn’t lose hope,” Manpreet said. “Youngsters are leading the way for us. It is the best thing when youngsters step up and perform, Mahinder to aaj Tsunami leke aagaya,” he added.

Manpreet credited the younger players of the team and Gujarat’s defensive setup for their win over Bulls. They were trailing 10-19 at one point and it looked like Gujarat may just succumb to their first home defeat of the season. But it was just then that their defence stepped up and performed consecutive Super Tackles, the first one on Rohit Kumar and the second on Ashish Kumar. Suddenly, the nine point deficit was reduced to five. This also revived their right corner specialist Abozar Mighani and raider Mahinder Rajput on the mat. Bulls captain Rohit agreed that they hadn’t planned anything for Mahinder. “We didn’t plan for Mahinder and that is where we gave away the points,” Rohit said.

Gujarat Fortunegiants top Zone A with 28 points and are unbeaten at home. (Express photo by Saundarya Mehra) Gujarat Fortunegiants top Zone A with 28 points and are unbeaten at home. (Express photo by Saundarya Mehra)

Gujarat didn’t let up. They pushed on and, with seven minutes left, the score was level at 21-21. The comeback was powered by the raid points. Followed next was Gujarat’s comeback led by their young brigade – Mahinder, Sachin Tawar and Rohit Gulia. Every time young Sachin used to go for a raid, the crowd would go wild as Sachin chants would begin. The 18-year old surely didn’t disappoint the crowd as he made two consecutive successful raids to give his side a 24-21 lead. Manpreet believes that

Manpreet believes that it is important to utilise youngsters passion in a correct direction. “You have to extract their best. They have this passion where they are not afraid of getting out,” Manpreet said.

However, one must credit the efforts of Parvesh Bhainswal, Abozar as they didn’t let the pressure build on the home side despite trailing Bulls by a huge gap. The duo scored four and three tackle points respectively to rescue their team from first defeat at home. Fortunegiants top Zone A with 28 points and have a 12-point lead on Puneri Paltan. They next play Telugu Titans and will hope to continue in the same vein.

"Australian Open comeback an ‘outrageous plan’, admits Serena Williams","Serena Williams plans to defend her Australian Open title in 2018. (Source: AP File) Serena Williams plans to defend her Australian Open title in 2018. (Source: AP File)

Serena Williams won the Australian Open this past year while she was pregnant. So expecting her to make a comeback within months of giving birth shouldn’t be a massive ask for a superhuman that she is. And yet the entire idea of such a comeback is an outrageous plan – the now dethroned World No 1 admits.

“It’s the most outrageous plan,” she said in an interview to Vogue. “I just want to put that out there. That’s, like, three months after I give birth. I’m not walking anything back, but I’m just saying it’s pretty intense.” Serena is expected to give birth at the end of the year and add to her already impressive tally of 23 Grand Slam titles.

But with a year away from the sport, Serena knows it will be a difficult ask with voices expected to grow louder if she doesn’t win outright. “In this game you can go dark fast,” she said. “If I lose, and I lose again, it’s like, she’s done. Especially since I’m not 20 years old. I’ll tell you this much: I won’t win less. Either I win, or I don’t play.” Serena isn’t the first tennis player looking to make a successful return to the court. Belgium’s Kim Clijsters retired at 23 having won a US Open but after a 28-month layoff, she returned having given birth to once again win at Flushing Meadows.

Another level of criticism that has been aimed at Serena has been her unorthodox style of play. Known to obliterate her opponents with sheer power on serve and in her groundstrokes while grunting her way around, her style isn’t known to attract fans. But the American thinks a lot of that expectation may have to do with her race. “Not only me, but women in general sometimes feel that power is a bad word,” said the 35-year-old. “As I’ve gotten older I’ve started to feel differently about it. Power is beauty. Strength is beauty. So now on the court I want people to think that I’m powerful. But I also want them to be shocked at how I play. I want people to expect something, then get something different.”

“I feel like people think I’m mean,” she said. “Really tough and really mean and really street. I believe that the other girls in the locker room will say, ‘Serena’s really nice.’ But Maria Sharapova, who might not talk to anybody, might be perceived by the public as nicer. Why is that? Because I’m black and so I look mean? That’s the society we live in. That’s life. They say African Americans have to be twice as good, especially women. I’m perfectly OK with having to be twice as good.”

Appearing on the cover of Vogue for a third time, Serena said her inclusion was a positive step for African American women. “Being black and being on the cover was really important to me,” she said. “The success of one woman should be the inspiration to another, and I’m always trying to inspire and motivate the black girls out there. I’m not a model. I’m not the girl next door. But I’m not hiding. Actually, I look like a lot of women out there. The American woman is many women, and I think it’s important to speak to American women at a time when they need encouragement. I’m not political, but I think everyone is worried, to a degree.”

Hopefully Mark Stoneman will take his opportunity in the first Test: Joe Root,"Mark stoneman will open the batting for england along with Alaistair Cook. Mark stoneman will open the batting for england along with Alaistair Cook.

England captain Joe Root has called upon opener Mark Stoneman to grab his chance and prove his mettle as an opening batsman during the three match Test series against West Indies.

Speaking to sky sports, Root said, “He’s obviously got a huge amount of runs under his belt this year, in particular, and in previous seasons as well. He’s got a well-rounded game, he’s a bit more experienced having played a lot of county cricket and I’m excited to see him go and hopefully take his opportunity.”

He further added, Ideally you want some to come in and set the world alight and their career moves forward from there. But I’d like to think Stoneman will get a very good opportunity and some good game time with England. This is just a great opportunity for Mark to go out and show everyone how good a player he is.”

England has had a troubled time in finding a settled opening combination. Commenting on it, Root said, “Of course you want [the top order] to be settled,” said Root. “You never want to go into a series with guys out of form or under pressure but I think that is one of the challenges of Test cricket. And, as a side, generally, we’ve responded quite well to that in the past.”

Meanwhile, with the day-night Test set to begin from Thursday, Root believes it is a chance for everyone in his team to get an experience.

“I think it is a great opportunity for the rest of the guys to experience a pink-ball Test match for the first time and I’m really excited to get the week going. I think there are different challenges that [the pink ball] brings and at different times of the day than you’d normally expect in Test cricket., Root said and added, “But, ultimately, it is still the same fundamentals of cricket and you’ve just got to make sure that when those difficult periods crop up that we respond well and quickly. I think it’s great that we’re giving [day-night Test cricket] the opportunity to work here, I’m sure it’ll be a very exciting spectacle. It’ll be interesting to see how this week pans out.”

"Analysis: To launch or not? Either way, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un may gain","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in Pyongyang, North Korea, left, and US President Donald Trump. (AP Photo) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in Pyongyang, North Korea, left, and US President Donald Trump. (AP Photo)

If, after all the fanfare, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn’t actually launch missiles toward Guam, many may write the whole episode off as another of the North’s seemingly endless bluffs. But from Pyongyang’s perspective and in the eyes of some U.S. military experts, Kim and his generals have already won this round.

Launch or not, Pyongyang has caused great drama and angst, riled U.S. President Donald Trump and alarmed America’s allies in Tokyo and Seoul. It could also set a precedent for more aggressive brinkmanship ahead.

It comes as no surprise then that on Tuesday, as North Korea’s state media released photos of Kim and his military officers examining the launch plan, replete with photos of the missiles’ flight path and a big satellite image of the U.S. territory’s Andersen Air Force Base, it also offered a seeming out.

Kim, it said, wants to “watch a little more” before making a decision.

The second test flight was captured by a rooftop camera operated by Japan’s NHK television on the northern island of Hokkaido. A solid-fuel “Pukguksong-2” missile lifts off during its launch test at an undisclosed location in North Korea.

The North’s plan is to launch four missiles into the waters around the U.S. Pacific territory: one to the north, one to the south, and one each east and west. Pyongyang is calling it an “enveloping fire” demonstration, but in military jargon it’s more commonly called “bracketing.” It was calculated to touch off a storm of anxiety region-wide.

But firing missiles into Guam’s exclusive economic zone, as the North threatened, would be an extremely risky move. “If they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly,” U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Monday. “Yes, that’s called war, if they shoot at us.”

So, from the start, Pyongyang gave itself big exit ramps.

The North has never said it would attack Guam itself. To make its intentions crystal clear, it provided an extremely detailed account of the planned trajectory of the launch, which Japanese prefectures it would go over, the duration of the flight – right down to the second – and the distance of the “splash areas” from Guam’s coast.

More importantly, it never committed to a launch date. Or, for that matter, to launching the missiles at all.

“The regime composed the threat in such a way as to allow Kim to back down without losing face,” said Adam Mount, a nuclear strategy specialist with the Center for American Progress. “North Korea’s Guam threat was more sophisticated, credible, and coercive than any of the vague warnings Trump made last week.”

Of course, Pyongyang could blow past its own fail-safes.

It may still want to try its missiles out at an angle closer to the “battle trajectory” they would fly in a real attack, rather than the “lofted” trajectories they’ve been using to avoid flying over neighboring countries. If pushed further, or possibly as a high-profile protest to U.S.-South Korean military exercises that will begin next week, it could also want to use the launch to show the world what it can do and see what it can get away with.

But many experts who follow North Korea think Kim isn’t in any big hurry.

“It seems to me they plan to draw this out, perhaps expecting Trump to lose interest,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. “It’s not an empty threat, but it’s also fairly high stakes. I imagine that the North Koreans would skip it if the rhetoric was toned down.”

Pyongyang has suggested Kim’s decision is contingent on B-1B bomber flights from Guam to Korean airspace. The B-1B, though no longer capable of carrying nuclear weapons, is one of the most advanced bombers in the Air Force and Washington has frequently ordered such missions – over South Korea but near the DMZ – as a show of force against Pyongyang.

If Washington were to halt the flights, Kim could claim a victory. If it were to order the B-1Bs into the air, Pyongyang would have an excuse to launch. Or it could claim it magnanimously refrained from doing so, while reserving the right to do so at a later date.

For Kim, in the convoluted world of military deterrence, that’s a win-win.

“I think at some point they’re going to say, `Look, this is not anything different than your flying B-1 bombers over Korea,”’ said Robert Carlin, a contributor to the respected 38 North website and former State Department and CIA analyst.

“We’re going to put our missiles 25 or 30 kilometers offshore. Your bombers come within tens of kilometers of the Demilitarized Zone. If you can `reach out and touch’ us, we can `reach out and touch’ you.”

Frankie Fredericks’ temporary ban upheld by IAAF tribunal,"Frankie Fredericks was temporarily banned in July.. (Source: Reuters) Frankie Fredericks was temporarily banned in July.. (Source: Reuters)

An athletics disciplinary tribunal upheld on Thursday a ban on former Namibian sprinter and IAAF Council member Frankie Fredericks pending an investigation into potential ethics violations.

Fredericks, a multiple Olympic sprint silver medallist and a rising star among international sports administrators until this year, was temporarily banned in July.

He is being investigated by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) over payments he received from Papa Massata Diack, the son of former IAAF president Lamine Diack, on the day Rio de Janeiro won the vote to host the 2016 Olympics.

Fredericks has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He admitted having received money from Massata Diack, but said it was payment for legitimate work he had done.

“Mr Fredericks appealed against the order for provisional suspension and his appeal was heard by an enlarged panel of the Disciplinary Tribunal,” the AIU said in a statement.

“Having heard from both parties, the enlarged panel agreed with the AIU’s submissions and it declined to lift the order for provisional suspension.”

Earlier this year Fredericks, an International Olympic Committee member, stepped down as head of the team evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics.

He also removed himself from the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) task force investigating doping allegations in Russia, after the corruption allegations involving himself surfaced.

(Source: Google Maps) Three women suicide bombers blew themselves up at the entrance to a camp for displaced people in northeast Nigeria. (Source: Google Maps)

Three women suicide bombers blew themselves up at the entrance to a camp for displaced people in northeast Nigeria, killing 28 people and wounding 82, local sources said. The attack took place on Tuesday in the town of Mandarari, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from Maiduguri, the capital of restive Borno state, said Baba Kura, a member of a vigilante force set up to fight jihadists.

“Three female bombers triggered their explosive outside of the IDP (internally displaced persons) camp… killing 28 people and wounding 82 others,” Kura said. The first assailant blew herself up, triggering panic, Kura added.

“People were trying to close their shops when two other female bombers triggered their explosives, causing most of the casualties,” he said.

Ibrahim Liman, the head of a local anti-jihadist militia force, confirmed the details of the attack, and said that more than 80 injured had been taken to Maiduguri hospital.

A source at the hospital said a “huge number” of patients had arrived.

Northeast Nigeria is a hotbed of activity by the Boko Haram jihadist group, involving shootings, bombings and kidnappings.

It launched an insurgency in 2009 that has killed about 20,000 people and displaced around 2.6 million others.

On Saturday, Boko Haram killed four people and torched homes in a night-time raid on the village of Amarwa, about 20 kilometres from Maiduguri, according to local sources.

"Charlottesville violence: Donald Trump, again, casts blame on both sides in Virginia","“You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. (Source: Reuters) “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that left- and right-wing extremists became violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Virginia, reigniting a political firestorm over US race relations and his own leadership of a national crisis.

Trump, who drew sharp criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his initial response, reverted on Tuesday to his position that both sides were at fault for the violence, a day after bowing to pressure to explicitly condemn the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Appearing angry and irritated, the president maintained that his original reaction was based on the facts he had at the time.

“You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. From there, the back and forth with reporters turned tense.

“Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,” Trump said of the deadly protest. “There was a group on this side. You can call them the left … that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that’s the way it is.”

The violence erupted on Saturday after white nationalists converged in Charlottesville for a “Unite the Right” rally in protest of plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the US Civil War. Many of the rally participants were seen carrying firearms, sticks and shields. Some also wore helmets. Counter-protesters likewise came equipped with sticks, helmets and shields.

The two sides clashed in scattered street brawls before a car plowed into the rally opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. A 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder. Two state police officers also were killed that day in the fiery crash of the helicopter they were flying in as part of crowd-control operations.

“MANY SIDES”

Addressing the melee for the first time on Saturday, Trump denounced hatred and violence “on many sides.” The comment drew sharp criticism across the political spectrum for not explicitly condemning the white nationalists whose presence in the Southern college town was widely seen as having provoked the unrest. Critics said Trump’s remarks then belied his reluctance to alienate extreme right-wing organizations, whose followers constitute a devoted segment of his political base despite his disavowal of them.

Yielding two days later to a mounting political furor over his initial response, Trump delivered a follow-up message expressly referring to the “KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups” as “repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.” Trump’s detractors dismissed his revised statements as too little too late, but his remarks newly inflamed the controversy.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke immediately applauded Trump on Twitter. “Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,” Duke wrote, referring to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and anti-facists.

Democrats seized on Trump’s latest words as evidence that Trump sees white nationalists and those protesting against them as morally equivalent. “By saying he is not taking sides, Donald Trump clearly is,” Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York, said. “When David Duke and white supremacists cheer your remarks, you’re doing it very, very wrong.”

In a similar vein, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said Trump’s characterization of the violence missed the mark. “Neo-Nazis, Klansmen and white supremacists came to Charlottesville heavily armed, spewing hatred and looking for a fight. One of them murdered a young woman in an act of domestic terrorism, and two of our finest officers were killed in a tragic accident while serving to protect this community. This was not ‘both sides,'” he said.

Administration officials, hoping to put the controversy behind them after the remarks on Monday, worried that the controversy would now last for days and potentially affect the president’s ability to made legislative and policy achievements. Asked about the White House’s next steps, one official said: “I think next steps are just to stop talking.”

FALLOUT

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation representing 12.5 million workers, became the latest member of Trump’s advisory American Manufacturing Council to resign in protest, saying, “We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Trumka said. “President Trump’s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis.”

Three other members of the council – the chief executives of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co Inc, sportswear company Under Armour Inc and computer chipmaker Intel Corp – resigned on Monday. In his remarks on Tuesday, Trump also sympathized with protesters seeking to keep Lee’s statue in place but offered no equivalent remarks for those who favored its removal.

“You had people in that group … that were there to protest the taking down of a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said. Trump also grouped former presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, two of the nation’s founding fathers, together with Confederate leaders such as Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson, who fought to separate Southern states from the Union, noting that all were slave owners.

“Was George Washington a slave owner? Will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? … Because he was a major slave owner,” Trump said. On Tuesday, Trump explained his initial restrained response by saying: “The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts.”

In what became at times a heated exchange with reporters shouting questions, Trump said, “You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.” He said that while neo-Nazis and white nationalists “should be condemned totally,” Trump said protesters in the other group “also had trouble-makers. And you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You got a lot of bad people in the other group too.”

Donald Trump’s close aide says US at economic war with China,"President Donald Trump’s close aide Steve Bannon has advocated a tougher stance toward China asserting that the US is at economic war with it, prompting Beijing to warn that “there is no winner in a trade war”.

(Representational Image)

President Donald Trump’s close aide Steve Bannon has advocated a tougher stance toward China asserting that the US is at economic war with it, prompting Beijing to warn that “there is no winner in a trade war”.

“We’re at economic war with China,” Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon told The American Prospect.

Of late media reports have said that Bannon is pushing for a strong policy against China. Many within the Trump Administration differ with him. “To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we’re five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we’ll never be able to recover,” Bannon said in response to a question.

The Chief White House Strategist said the United States would take a strong action against China. “We’re going to run the tables on these guys. We’ve come to the conclusion that they’re in an economic war and they’re crushing us,” said Bannon who once headed the right-wing Breitbart News.

Commenting on his remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in Beijing warned that “there is no winner in a trade war” and appealed for dialogue. “We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century,” she said.

In his interview over phone, Bannon argued that there was no military solution to North Korean provocative behaviour. “There’s no military solution (to North Korea’s nuclear threats), forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us,” Bannon said.

On Monday, Trump signed an executive order asking the US Trade Representative for examination of Chinese policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of US technology and the theft of its intellectual property. “The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,” Trump said.

In the interview, Bannon said that he is getting hawks placed at key position. At the same time he acknowledged that he is getting opposition from various section. “That’s a fight I fight every day here,” he said.

“We’re still fighting. There’s Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,” he added. “We gotta do this. The president’s default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don’t get me wrong. It’s like, every day,” Bannon said.

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch recently urged President Donald Trump to sack his far-right chief strategist Steve Bannon, The New York Times reports. Murdoch made his plea during a White House dinner before Trump left for vacation in New Jersey on August 4, the Times said yesterday. The timing means it preceded the violence that broke out over the weekend at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, leaving one dead and 19 wounded. Bannon’s critics label him a white supremacist.

The dinner was also attended by Jared Kushner, one of Trump’s closest advisers and the husband of his daughter Ivanka, and Trump’s new chief of staff John Kelly, the paper said, quoting a person familiar with the conversation. Trump did not strongly counter Murdoch’s advice and expressed frustration with Bannon, the paper said.

CBS News also said Bannon’s job is in jeopardy after Trump failed to speak out immediately against white supremacists after the violence in Virginia. Bannon could be gone by the end of the week, CBS said, quoting a source it did not identify. Bannon, the former head of ultra conservative outlet Breitbart News, is described as being the nucleus of one of several competing power centers in what has been a chaotic White House.

The Times said Kelly has warned he will not tolerate what he sees as Bannon’s behind the scenes manoeuvring in the West Wing. The paper quoted a dozen current and former Trump aides and associates who have knowledge of the situation.

Murdoch, a founder of Fox News, which Trump is said to watch assiduously and often praises as he criticises other mainstream media as sources of fake news, is close to Kushner, the Times said. And Kushner does not get along well with Bannon, it added.

The Times said Bannon is in disfavour for allegedly leaking stories about White House colleagues who he feels do not sufficiently adhere to Bannon’s populist agenda, fighting nastily with Kushner and creating a unit that operates outside the chain of command in the White House.

"England vs West Indies, Day-Night Test, Preview: England take on West Indies in ‘unknown territory’","England’s Alastair Cook trains under floodlights at Edgbaston in Birmingham ahead of the first Day/Night Test against West Indies. (Source: AP) England’s Alastair Cook trains under floodlights at Edgbaston in Birmingham ahead of the first Day/Night Test against West Indies. (Source: AP)

As England takes on West Indies at Edgbaston on Thursday in a three -match Test series, history beckons itself. However, all the limelight has gathered around the first Test since it will be the first day-night Test on English shores. This will also be the fifth Test to be played with a pink ball.

To quote Stuart Broad England are stepping forth into unknown territory. The Three Lions have never played pink ball cricket on the international stage whereas West Indies have the advantage of the prior experience of playing the longer format under lights.

While this is sure to ruffle up the selection strategy of the home side, what England has on their side is confidence up to the brim after beating South Africa in the previous series. While the top order continues to look fragile with Mark Stoneman set to make his debut, the onus will once more be on Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Moeen Ali to bat at the top of the order. Among the seamers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad are set to lead the attack. After an impressive outing in the last series, Toby-Roland Jones seems likely to be the third seamer. However, whether Chris Woakes gets a look in still remains to be seen. Riding high on an incredible form Ben Stokes is another player to watch out for. What works in England’s favour is that the last time these two sides met was in an ODI series and England defeated the then home side 3-0

West Indies, however, have a miserable away record and hence will be looking to improve upon it. Kieran Powell will have to shoulder the responsibility at the top of the order with the likes of Shai Hope, Roston Chase supporting down the order. However, West Indies will be bolstered by the return of fast bowler Kemar Roach. In conditions suitable to seam and swing Roach will be quite a handful.

Meanwhile, as far as the pink ball is concerned it will provide a unique experience for the 70,000 odd crowd. The key session will be the final session which will witness the period around sunset. The blending of natural light and the floodlights is known to be a testing time for batsmen.

Squads:

England

Joe Root (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Toby Roland-Jones, Ben Stokes, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Chris Woakes.

West Indies

Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Braithwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich (wk), Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Kieran Powell, Raymon Reifer, Kemar Roach.

China’s Belt and Road acquisitions surge despite outbound capital crackdown,"Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo) Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo)

Mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries that are part of the Belt and Road initiative are soaring, even as Beijing cracks down on China’s acquisitive conglomerates to restrict capital outflows. Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially linked to President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy totalled $33 billion as of Monday, surpassing the $31 billion tally for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at building a modern-day “Silk Road”, connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa. At a summit in May, Xi pledged $124 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.

The surge in Chinese companies’ acquisition-linked investments in the Belt and Road corridor comes as the volume of all outbound mergers and acquisitions from China has dropped 42 percent year-on-year as of Monday, the Thomson Reuters data showed.

Beijing’s move to prop up the yuan by restricting the flow of capital outside the country and clamp down on debt-fuelled acquisitions to ensure financial stability has made it tougher for buyers to win approvals for deals abroad.

Regulators have tightened the screws further since June, reviewing deal agreements in minute detail and ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on overseas buying sprees, including HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group.

The heightened regulatory scrutiny of overseas acquisitions comes after companies spent a record $220 billion in 2016 on assets overseas, buying up everything from movie studios to European football clubs.

The scrutiny, however, has not impacted Chinese companies’ pursuit of targets along the Belt and Road corridor, as those investments are considered strategic for the companies as well as the Chinese economy. “People are thinking in a long-term approach when making investments along Belt and Road countries,” said Hilary Lau, a corporate and commercial lawyer and partner at the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.

“The acquisitions are also policy-driven. There are funds allocated by Chinese banks and state funds for Belt and Road deals,” he said.

The number of Chinese deals targeting Belt and Road countries totalled 109 this year, compared to 175 in the whole of last year and 134 in 2015, the Thomson Reuters data showed.

Approval Process

Companies enjoy a relatively smooth approval process for deals along the Belt and Road project as regulators tend to put them in a different basket when reviewing outbound investments, according to lawyers and dealmakers. “If you are doing One Belt, One Road, that becomes the first sentence in the document” to the regulators, said a senior investment advisor at a Chinese company that has acquired several overseas businesses.

“It is a wise thing to point out early on,” said the advisor, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. The largest deal in a Belt and Road country so far this year was a Chinese consortium’s $11.6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties.

Other top deals include the $1.8 billion purchase of an 8 percent ownership interest in an Abu Dhabi oil company by the state-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corp, and HNA Group’s $1 billion acquisition of a logistics company, CWT Ltd, which has not yet closed. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s foreign exchange regulator, said this month that domestic companies would still be encouraged to participate in Belt and Road activities.

HNA, which has seen at least two overseas deals hit a hurdle as a result of the crackdown on transferring money, has said it plans to prioritize investments that are in industries and regions mapped out under the Belt and Road initiative. The belt and road acquisitions are predominantly in energy and infrastructure sectors, said Hilary Lau of Herbert Smith Freehills. “We’ve seen a lot of activities recently in Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The whole Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh corridor is also hot as it’s connecting the East and West,” he said.

Girona bolstered by Manchester City links as they prepare for top flight debut,"Trophy friendly soccer match between Girona and Manchester City. (Source: AP) Trophy friendly soccer match between Girona and Manchester City. (Source: AP)

La Liga newcomers Girona hope their links with Premier League Manchester City will help them in their bid to stay in Spain’s top flight after an 87-year wait to get there.

The Catalan side begin their first campaign among Spain’s elite on Saturday with 10-times Liga champions Atletico Madrid visiting their Montilivi stadium, which has been hastily expanded from a capacity of 9,000 to 13,500.

Girona earned automatic promotion last season after missing out in the playoffs in three of the previous four years, including two final defeats.

Coach Pablo Machin has been at the helm since 2014, avoiding relegation to the third tier in his first campaign before finally earning promotion at the third time of asking last season.

His side have been boosted by the arrival of four players from Manchester City for the upcoming season, renewing an existing deal for right back Pablo Maffeo and adding midfielders Aleix Garcia and Douglas Luiz as well as Colombia international Marlos Moreno.

Girona’s alliance with City began in August 2015 with the loan of Spanish defender Ruben Sobrino and Frenchman Florian Lejeune, who has since returned to the Premier League with Newcastle United.

A total of nine players have moved between the two clubs in the ensuing time.

Girona held part of their pre-season training at City’s Etihad Campus in July while City played a friendly at Girona on Tuesday, three days after beginning their Premier League campaign, which the Spanish side won 1-0.

Pere Guardiola, the brother of City coach Pep and a high-profile agent representing players including Barcelona’s Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, is largely credited for fostering the ties with Girona.

The agent has been an adviser at Girona since overseeing their takeover by French media company TV Sports Events in 2015 when the club were in huge financial difficulty and had debts totalling 4.5 million euros ($5.28 million).

These links could be further strengthened with British and Spanish media reporting that City Football Group, the Premier League side’s parent company, are finalising a takeover of the Catalan club.

The deal will expand the number of clubs under the City Football Group’s umbrella to six with Girona joining MLS franchise New York City, Australian side Melbourne City, Japan’s Yokohama F. Marinos and Uruguay’s Club Atletico Torque in addition to the Manchester club.

Cross-border club alliances are not unprecedented in Spain.

Andalusian side Granada were taken over by the Udinese-owning Pozzo family in 2009 and won promotion to the top flight in 2011. They were relegated last season, exactly a year after cutting their Italian ties.

Girona coach Machin is wary of Granada’s example but welcomes his side’s links with City.

“It makes us proud to have this relationship with a big team like City, and the aim is for both clubs to make the most of it,” he said.

“City have a great place for their young talents to grow and we hope we can give them the opportunity to be more competitive by giving them the chance to compete in one of the best leagues in the world.

“It’s positive for us but this club is no testing ground. We are absolutely clear that we want to stay up and we only play the best players to achieve that objective,” he added, stressing that the loanees would get no preferential treatment.

"Racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia poisoning societies: Antonio Guterres","UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres (Source: File) UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres (Source: File)

Racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia must be opposed by everyone in the world, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said amid an outrage over President Donald Trump’s defence of white supremacists following the Charlottesville violence. A woman was killed and 19 other people injured in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters.

Trump held ‘both sides’ responsible for the violence. When asked whether he is under pressure from the US government to not speak freely, Guterres strongly replied in the negative. “I’ve received no pressure at all not to speak. We had, in a previous meeting, discussed, which I read, probably too much of a low profile, and I said that I was going to correct that. I believe this stakeout is the proof that I am doing it,” he added.

“Well, I do not comment on what presidents say. I affirm principles. And the principles I affirm are very clear. Racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or Islamophobia are…poisoning our societies. And it is absolutely essential for us all to stand up against them everywhere and every time,” Guterres said.

His comments came in response to a question on Trump’s response to the violence at rallies held by white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville over the weekend. Guterres said speaking as Secretary-General, he should speak for the whole world. He added that as an European, he is proud of the contribution that Europe gave to all civilisation with the values of enlightenment, tolerance, the respect for the other, the importance of recognition of diversity.

“And to be able to stand for these values and to… at the same time, to condemn all forms of irrationality that undermine those values is essential, at the present moment, be it in the United States or everywhere else in the world. Unfortunately, these demons are appearing a little bit everywhere,” he said.

Guterres asserted that there is nothing that will influence him not to affirm the values that he considers the essential values of the UN Charter and civilisation. “And, whenever necessary, I will say whatever I believe is necessary, independently of the fact that that might be not pleasant for the President of this country or any other country,” he said.

Former West Indies cricketer Joel Garner warned England to not underrestimate West Indies, who are ranked eighth in the world saying that cricket is played in the middle at the end of the day. West Indies will be playing their second day-night Test while England their first.

“It’s going to be some interesting times,” Garner told espncricinfo. “I think people are writing the West Indies off too early and it could be at their own peril. Cricket is played in the middle at the end of the day. Not many people are giving us a lot of hope. What is good is that we came in whilst England were playing South Africa. We got on with the job very quietly. I think the fellas have got talent. It’s who makes the greatest adjustment in the day-night game. I think that games between England and the West Indies are competitive. I wouldn’t completely write them off.”

Many senior players are not featuring in the squad. “It is what it is,” Garner said of the selection. “I think that the players have made a decision they want to play a shorter version of the game. There is an amnesty between the board and the players, relating to the players being available. We will welcome them back because they are our better players but at the present moment we are here to play cricket. We’ve got to work with what we’ve got and try to get the best results out of it. I think that’s as fair as it can be.”

“The senior players who are away, they will have to make their mind up about whether they want to come back and play the longer version of the game. What we have now is that Roach is back after a year or so away from cricket. We also have [Shannon] Gabriel, who was injured. He’s been working to get his rhythm back and there’s the captain, [Jason] Holder.”

“I would say, you can call it criticism if you like, that attitudes have changed somewhat towards training and preparation. I go back to the way of ‘if you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail’. Most of what has been happening has been over preparation. People might not want to train the way that they should train or might not prepare the way that they should prepare,” he added.

Former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav detained on Agra Lucknow Expressway,"Former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav. Former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav.

Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav was on Thursday detained by the police in Unnao while he was on his way to Auraiya where a clash had occurred between the police and SP workers on Wednesday during the filing of nomination papers for the by-election for the post of zila panchayat chairperson.

Akhilesh was released later in the afternoon, after which he told reporters that the SP will continue to go among the people. He was going to meet party leader and former MLA Pradeep Yadav who was arrested in Auraiya on Wednesday.

Police had arrested Pradeep Yadav after SP workers clashed with the police near the district magistrate’s office during the process of filing of nomination papers by the candidates for the election to the post of zila panchayat chairperson. Auraiya City Circle Offier Bashkar Verma said the clash started after SP workers targeted vehicles, including one of a BJP MLA’s brother.

Auraiya District Magistrate Jai Prakash Sagar said two candidates filed their nomination papers for the by-election. He said the clash started after the supporters of candidates gathered outside quarreled with each other. The by-election is slated to be held on August 22.

Unnao Additional SP Ashtabhuja Singh said Akhilesh and his supporters were detained under section 151 of CrPC and kept at Virendra Kumar Singh Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Hasanganj area of the district. “He was on his way to Auraiya when he was detained. He was released on a personal bond and left for Lucknow,” said Singh.

The incidents of roadblocks, arson and ransacking of vehicles have been reported from Kanpur and Allahabad districts as the SP workers came out on the streets to protest against the detention of Akhilesh.

SP state president Naresh Uttam, MLA Amitabh Bajpayee and several other party workers were also detained in Kanpur. In Lucknow, about a dozen SP workers staged a sit-in at the gate of secretariat building that houses Chief Minister’s Office where they tried to block the entry before being removed from there by the police.

Addressing a press conference at SP office in Lucknow on August 10, Akhilesh had alleged that SP leaders, who are members of Auraiya zila panchayat, have been “implicated” in cases of murder and rape in order to help a BJP leader in the by-election for the post of zila panchayat chairperson.

He had also presented five party leaders, Rajvir Singh, Prashant Pal, Shiv Singh Pal, Sudhir Kumar and Ravi Rajput, whose wife Neelam is zila panchayat member, saying the five were being “hounded by the police”. A no-confidence motion was passed against Rajvir, who was chairperson of zila panchayat, in July allegedly at the behest of BJP leader Deepu Singh who is now BJP-supported candidate for the post of zila panchayat chairperson in the by-election.

SP-supported candidate in the by-election is Sudhir Kumar alias Kallu, who filed his nomination papers on Wednesday.

Why are Confederate statues at the center of latest conflict in US?,"Charlottesville violence: A group of counter-protesters rally against members of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters) Charlottesville violence: A group of counter-protesters rally against members of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters)

Last week in Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacists descended onto the city to protest against the city’s plan to remove Confederate statues, namely pro-slavery Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s statue. After Charlottesville voted for the removal of the statue earlier this year, white nationalist leaders had protested against the decision multiple times. In May this year, white nationalist leader Richard Spencer had come to the statue with his supporters for a nighttime protest. Subsequently, in June, at least 50 members of a North Carolina-based Ku Klux Klan group travelled all the way to Charlottesville for a protest rally, where they were met with hundreds of counter-protesters.

The protests are different from previous ones in terms of its sheer scale and open display of Nazi propaganda. Nazi-era slogans like ‘blood and soil’, ‘You will not replace us’, ‘ Jew will not replace us’, echoed through the protest site by torch-wielding white nationalists. Meanwhile, the protests took a deadly turn when a 20-year-old man ploughed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters killing a 32-year-old woman and wounded several others.

Hours after the death, US President Donald Trump denounced the violence but stopped short of condemning the white nationalists and Nazi groups. Trump’s criticism of neo-Nazi groups came only two days later when he said, “Racism is evil. White supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”

Responding to Charlottesville incident, Kentucky Mayor Jim Gray fast tracked his city’s plans to take down the Confederate monuments. Soon after, in North Carolina’s Durham, protesters also pulled down a statue dedicated to Confederate soldiers, followed by Baltimore’s decision to tear down its own Confederate monuments almost overnight this week.

Why is America suddenly so concerned about pulling down these statues?

The current protests go back to a mass shooting incident in 2015, involving a self-proclaimed white supremacist Dylann Roof who gunned down at least nine African-Americans in South Carolina’s Charleston. The incident drew a lot of eyeballs as Roof was displayed in pictures after the attack posing with the Confederate flag. This stoked a fight within South Carolina whether it should pull down a Confederate flag that had historically flown at the state capitol for years now. Eventually, the state officially took down the flag.

Ever since this incident came into the spotlight, many states, particularly in the South, have increasingly questioned their very own Confederate symbols. The core argument is this: Confederacy was essentially built upon the premise of preserving slavery and white supremacy in the United States of America. So this isn’t something the country needs to honour or commemorate in any possible way.

Critics of Confederate monuments opine that these statues are really not about commemorating pro-slavery movement but merely preserving Southern pride. They are going by the premise that if you take down these statues, you’re taking down a part of history with it. But historians believe that the documents from the time reveal that Confederacy was built upon maintaining slavery.

To add insult to the injury, US President Donald Trump controversially compared George Washington with Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in one of his statements. “This week, it is Robert E. Lee and, this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?”

Here is where the entire discussion gets a little complicated, raising pertinent questions about the United States of America and its history. Historical evidence certainly suggests the answer is very clear: The Confederacy and the monuments dedicated to it always stood for white supremacy, although much of US is coming to terms with it.

CoA demands BCCI office bearers be removed for non compliance,"Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI) Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI)

The Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators has demanded that BCCI office-bearers CK Khanna, Amitabh Choudhary, Anirudh Chaudhary be removed from office for non compliance of the directives.

In their status report submitted to the Apex Court, the CoA also demanded forensic audit of each state association under 3-member committee of a former Supreme Court judge on the lines of Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) and Hyderabad. The status report further says, “It’s clear state associations have no desire to implement reforms.”

CoA also observed that Johri was prevented from attending the board’s SGM on July 26 where decisions were taken on implementation of the reforms. In their status report, the CoA observed the SGM as “…nothing but an exercise in self-perpetuation by vested, interests…”.

In the fifth status report, the CoA suggested:

– more empowerment to finalise the text of the new BCCI constitution;

– bring into effect the new BCCI Constitution immediately upon the CoA;

– bring in a new funds disbursement policy with funds from BCCI to state associations only made according to that;

– create a separate committee to commission a forensic audit of each state association;

– appoint an administrator a month before elections in a state association to oversee the preparation of electoral polls;

– direct the existing office bearers of BCCI – CK Khanna, Amitabh Choudhary and Anirudh Chaudhary be disallowed from being associated with the working of the BCCI – and hand over control to the CoA headed by the BCCI CEO (Rahul Johri) until elections are held.

The initial committee comprised of Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikram Limaye, and former Indian women cricket captain Diana Edulji. They all interacted with Rahul Johri, CEO of BCCI, for supervision and functioning of the cricket Board. Guha and Limaye had stepped down from their roles.

A tree crashed down on a popular religious festival on the Portuguese island of Madeira on Tuesday, killing 12 people and injuring 52 others, officials said. The tree fell while a large crowd was gathered near the island’s capital of Funchal as part of the Nossa Senhora do Monte festival. It’s Madeira’s biggest annual festivity and was being held Monday and Tuesday, drawing large crowds to a church on Funchal’s outskirts.

Local media reports said that the tree was an oak that was more than 200 years old. Regional health chief Pedro Ramos said that seven people had serious injuries. Ramos said that of the 12 fatalities, 10 people died at the site of the accident. A child died en route to a local hospital, where another woman also perished.

RTP public television showed images of emergency workers gathered under a group of tall trees on the Atlantic island. Ambulances were shown pulling away from the site while workers wielding chain saws cut away limbs from an enormous tree on the ground.

More televised images showed some people attending to the injured. Others appeared visibly shaken. Miguel Albuquerque, the head of the regional government of Madeira, declared three days of mourning for the victims.

Prime Minister Antonio Costa shared his condolences for the victims on his Twitter account. “I express my condolences for the victims of the accident in Madeira,” Costa said. “My thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims.”

Costa said that the central government made contact with local authorities on the island to offer its support. “The government has provided medical support given the high number of victims,” he said.

"Shiv Sena criticises PM Modi’s Independence-Day comments on Kashmir, communal violence","“Who is perpetrating violence in the name of faith and what are the reasons for that? When former Vice-President Hamid Ansari spoke about Muslims feeling insecure, he had to face immense criticism. Those who subscribe to the Sangh’s ideology asked him to leave the country,” the editorial further stated. “Who is perpetrating violence in the name of faith and what are the reasons for that? When former Vice-President Hamid Ansari spoke about Muslims feeling insecure, he had to face immense criticism. Those who subscribe to the Sangh’s ideology asked him to leave the country,” the editorial further stated.

The Shiv Sena on Wednesday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day address in which he said the problems in Kashmir could only be resolved by embracing Kashmiris. “We are surprised how no one else had this great thought yet. Now to implement this vision you need to do only one thing. Remove Article 370 from Kashmir so that hordes from India can go to Kashmir and hug people there,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.

The Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech said the Kashmir problem could not be resolved by either bullets or by abuses. The Sena also took a swipe at the PM over his claims that communal and caste-based violence had been tackled.

“Who is perpetrating violence in the name of faith and what are the reasons for that? When former Vice-President Hamid Ansari spoke about Muslims feeling insecure, he had to face immense criticism. Those who subscribe to the Sangh’s ideology asked him to leave the country,” the editorial further stated.

It went on to add that the government needed to do a lot more to stop this violence. “On the issue of cow protection, certain sections of the Hindu society have become violent and fanatic. Giving warnings to them is not going to suffice,” it said.

It also suggested that those who were creating a divide within Indians were being shielded by political parties.

“The non vegetarian-vegetarian debate in Mumbai is the rise of a new type of fanaticism. We need to find out which political party provides patronage to builders who deny houses to non-vegetarians,” the Saamana editorial stated.

The Sena also said that the violence in “the name of faith is prevalent in the country”, which frightens not only the Muslims but the Hindus as well.

The Sena further questioned why the government was not as strict against those who refuse to sing ‘Vande Mataram’ as the way it implemented demonetisation and GST.

"Punjab’s debt-ridden farmer commits suicide on Independence Day, another critical","A farmer from Punjab. (Representative Image) A farmer from Punjab. (Representative Image)

Even as the country was celebrating Independence Day on Tuesday, a debt-ridden farmer in Mansa committed suicide while another farmer from Muktsar consumed poison on August 14 evening and is now battling for life. Avtar Singh (36) from village Alisherkalan in Mansa district died after he consumed poison on Tuesday. Gurpreet Singh (30) of Mahabadar village in Muktsar district is critical after he consumed poison on August 14.

Avtar Singh, a landless farmer, had no means to return a debt of Rs 4 lakh while Gurpreet had a debt of Rs 15 lakh and was upset because of white fly attack on his cotton crop. Avtar Singh was married and had three children. He had sold off all his 4 acres of land last year due to his growing debt, but was still saddled with a debt of Rs 4 lakh. After selling off his land, he was rearing dairy animals for a living and growing fodder for them in about a kanal of land. Harbans Singh, sarpanch of village Alisherkalan, said, “He had a debt of Rs 4 lakh taken from a commission agent which he was not able to repay.”

In Muktsar’s Mahabadar village, Gurpreet Singh had two acres of land on which he grew cotton. He had a debt of Rs 15 lakh, of which Rs 10.5 lakh was taken from a commission agent and the rest from a private bank. The cheque he had given to the commission agent bounced after which the latter was pressuring him to return his money. The white fly attack on his cotton crop only worsened his situation, said father Balwinder Singh. Only last week, CM Amarinder Singh had visited villages in Mansa to take stock of white fly pest on cotton crop and had appealed to farmers not to resort to suicides.

West Brom sign midfielder Gareth Barry from Everton,"West Bromwich Albion have signed Gareth Barry on a one-year deal. West Bromwich Albion have signed Gareth Barry on a one-year deal.

West Bromwich Albion have signed former England midfielder Gareth Barry on a one-year deal from Premier League rivals Everton, the Midlands club announced on Tuesday.

The 36-year-old, who has also played for Aston Villa and Manchester City, moved for an undisclosed fee having turned down the chance to extend his four-year stay at Everton.

He is five games from breaking ex-Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs’ record 632 Premier League appearances.

“I want to help the team improve, work hard and hopefully add quality,” Barry, who has 53 England caps, told the club’s website (www.wba.co.uk). West Brom coach Tony Pulis believes Barry, who played 154 times for Everton having arrived from Manchester City on loan, is the ideal replacement for former captain Darren Fletcher who has joined fellow Midlands top-flight club Stoke City.

“There was a big void when we lost ‘Fletch’ and Gareth will fill that void,” said Pulis. “He’s a fantastic player and I think his attitude towards playing is really gauged by the fact that Everton had offered him a two-year contract to stay there.

Barry is West Brom’s fourth signing of the transfer window following Jay Rodriguez, Ahmed Hegazi and China international Yuning Zhang, who has joined Werder Bremen on loan.

Two experts likely murdered by Congo militia members: UN board,"The five-page summary noted that information is circulating about the possible involvement “of various government individuals or organisations” in the killings. (Source: Google maps) The five-page summary noted that information is circulating about the possible involvement “of various government individuals or organisations” in the killings. (Source: Google maps)

A United Nations board of inquiry said two UN experts were likely murdered in March by militia members from Congo’s violence-torn Kasai region, but it said further investigations and judicial proceedings are needed to determine the identity and motive of the killers. The board’s executive summary, which was obtained yesterday by The Associated Press, said that “there was a reasonable likelihood that the killings were committed after consultation with other local tribal actors.”

Michael Sharp of the United States and Zaida Catalan, a dual national of Sweden and Chile, disappeared March 12 and their bodies were discovered in shallow graves March 27. The board’s report, sent to the UN Security Council by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said there is “a reasonable likelihood” the same militia members were responsible for the deaths of a Congolese interpreter and three motorcycle drivers accompanying the two experts. Their bodies have not been found.

The five-page summary noted that information is circulating about the possible involvement “of various government individuals or organisations” in the killings. “This does not provide proof of intent or motive” by anyone, or preclude “that others are involved,” the board said.

The board said additional investigations, including by national authorities, “may provide greater clarity on this issue.” Guterres said in a letter to the Security Council transmitting the board’s summary that he intends to discuss “the establishment of a follow-on mechanism and its mandate” with Congolese official and council members Ida Sawyer, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said late yesterday the secretary-general needed to take responsibility for uncovering the truth of the two UN experts’ deaths following the board’s inconclusive results.

“Since Congolese security forces may have been responsible for the killings, the Congolese government cannot be relied on to find the killers,” Sawyer said. “Guterres should set up a UN investigation to uncover the truth and help US and Swedish authorities as they work to build cases against those responsible for this heinous crime,” she said.

Two Africans, including a Tanzanian woman, have been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in New Delhi after drugs worth Rs 40 crore were allegedly seized from them, officials said on Thursday. Officials in the central anti-narcotics agency said the other person arrested in the case is a Nigerian man, identified as Augustin (33). They said the two were apprehended on Wednesday after the Delhi zonal unit of the NCB first nabbed the woman, Tanzanian national Beatrice K Ndyetabula (40), from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in New Delhi.

They said the woman landed in Delhi from Mumbai and when she was intercepted and frisked in the terminal area, 27 ribbon rolls concealing 4-kg of cocaine powder were recovered from her hand baggage. She had arrived in Mumbai early yesterday from Kenya and the alleged drugs consignment was to be handed over to the Nigerian man in the national capital, they said.

The lady was purposefully allowed to hand over the consignment to the Nigerian man at a Delhi metro station, where he too was apprehended, they added. “The 4-kg drugs consignment is suspected to be cocaine and is worth Rs 40 crore in the international market,” a senior officer said. “The two have been arrested under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) and their links are being probed,” NCB Zonal Director (Delhi) Madho Singh said.

"Cristiano Ronaldo scores sublime goal in training, watch video","Cristiano Ronaldo beat two defenders and the keeper in the Real Madrid training. (Source: Instagram screenshot) Cristiano Ronaldo beat two defenders and the keeper in the Real Madrid training. (Source: Instagram screenshot)

Cristiano Ronaldo has had a short spell on the pitch so far in the new season. And yet he has made quite an impact – for good reasons and bad. He came on as a substitute in Real Madrid’s 2-1 win over Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Playing against his former side, Ronaldo came off to a mixed response in Macedonia with a combination of jeers and cheers for the Portuguese striker. Ronaldo had barely practiced with the squad following his late arrival from holidays.

However, he enjoyed much more time on the pitch in his second game of the season when he came on as a substitute in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona at Camp Nou. Soon after coming on, Ronaldo scored a sublime strike that beat Barcelona keeper Marc Andre Ter-Stegen in goal with a fierce right footed strike finding the corner of the goal.

His celebrations, taking off his shirt to show off his flex body, earned him a booking. Moments later, he was through on goal but went down seeking a penalty under the challenge from Samuel Umtiti. The referee considered it a case of cheating and booked Ronaldo for his second booking and a red card. Clearly upset with the decision, Ronaldo left in a huff but not before shoving the referee which earned him a five match ban. The capital club has 10 days to file an appeal.

Even though he would be absent for the next four weeks, should the ban hold, the Portuguese captain continues to make a mark on the training grounds at Valdebebas. In the latest clip, he beat Nacho Fernandez and another defender with neat step over and shimmied to create an inch of space and beat the keeper in goal with a shot finding the corner. Watch out keepers in Spain!

Rare photos of Jawaharlal Nehru from the archives of photojournalist Kulwant Roy,"Rare photos of Jawaharlal Nehru from the archives of photojournalist Kulwant Roy

A selection of historical images of Jawaharlal Nehru from Kulwant Roy’s work, as documented by Aditya Arya in the valuable visual archive History in the Making.

Kulwant Roy (1914-1984) was among the handful of Indian photojournalists who lived and worked through the exciting times before and after India’s Independence, yet his contributions seemed all but lost in the annals of time until relatively recently. His valuable archive of unpublished prints and negatives lay forgotten in boxes for more than 20 years after his death in ’84 until they were discovered by the man who was a close family friend and to whom Roy had left his work.

While Roy’s photographs which allow us into old cities and towns when they were less crowded, to ride in outmoded means of transport (Royal Enfield motorcycle or a car with a short license plate: DLB 300), to listen to a giant radio set or discuss old sartorial trends in India’s diverse society, are fascinating in its entire breadth, it is politics which Aditya Arya describes as the spinal cord of his story. Roy’s photographs recorded and captured events preceding and following India’s independence, in the true spirit of the medium, without reconstruction, manipulation or staging. “Kulwant’s Roy’s photographs never make us feel that history is headed in the wrong direction,” writes historian Indivar Kamtekar, “On the contrary, they declare that the world was progressing. In doing so, they embody the optimism of the first decades of independent India”.

Here is a selection of historical images of Jawaharlal Nehru from Roy’s work, as documented by Arya in the valuable visual archive History in the Making.

Patrick Patterson: Journey in finding one of West Indies’ most lethal bowlers,"Updated: July 23, 2017 1:20 pm

The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s. Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story.

There had been murmurs around about Patterson’s present state — that he’s lost in the bush or is in an asylum; maybe, even roaming the streets as a destitute."
"Gorakhpur Tragedy: ‘No faith in govt-appointed panel, let SC judge or all-party MPs group probe’, says Congress","Senior party leaders, including former Union minister Mukul Wasnik, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Mohan Prakash and AICC women’s wing chief arrived in Gorakhpur on Wednesday and met families of some of the children. (Express Photo) Senior party leaders, including former Union minister Mukul Wasnik, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Mohan Prakash and AICC women’s wing chief arrived in Gorakhpur on Wednesday and met families of some of the children. (Express Photo)

The Congress on Wednesday demanded that a Supreme Court judge or all-party group of Members of Parliament inquire into the deaths of children in BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur on August 10. Senior party leaders, including former Union minister Mukul Wasnik, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Mohan Prakash and AICC women’s wing chief arrived in Gorakhpur on Wednesday and met families of some of the children. “We have been sent by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi to offer all support to the affected families. While we have visited two of them, each of us would now go in different direction to meet more families,” said Wasnik.

The party leaders said they did not believe the panel formed by the state government would conduct a fair inquiry when the government believed that the deaths were not because of oxygen shortage.

“Families are still in fear. They were not given ambulances to take body of their children and were asked to leave hospital as soon as possible. Some of them were not even given death certificate. We demand an inquiry into the entire incident by a Supreme Court judge or group of all-party Members of Parliament because even families are demanding justice,”said Wasnik.

“On one hand, the Chief Minister is talking about an inquiry that has been ordered into the incident and at the same time, he is giving his verdict that the deaths were not because of oxygen shortage. In such a scenario, how is it possible for an inquiry team to go against the word of the Chief Minister?”

Meanwhile, AICC General Secretary Mohan Prakash said, “Most of the families that we visited today informed us that they were not given facilities there and were asked to pump AMBU (Artificial Manual Breathing Unit) bags for hours. This was a day after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had visited Medical college and reviewed the facilities,” adding, “Now our first question is that what exactly did Chief Minister review on that day?”

CoA tells Supreme Court: Sack BCCI’s top three office-bearers,"The CoA has severely criticised the conduct of BCCI acting chief CK Khanna (left), secretary Amitabh Choudhary (centre) and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry. The CoA has severely criticised the conduct of BCCI acting chief CK Khanna (left), secretary Amitabh Choudhary (centre) and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry.

IN ONE of the sharpest attacks on Indian cricket officialdom since it took charge in January, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has urged the Supreme Court to remove the top three BCCI office-bearers, stating that their conduct was “unfit” and that they weren’t in a position to “make good” on their undertakings of implementing the Lodha reforms.

While recommending the ouster of acting president C K Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and acting treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, the CoA has asked for the management, administration and governance of Indian cricket to be entrusted exclusively in their hands till the new set of office-bearers is appointed via fresh elections.

This is the most stinging and significant of the CoA’s recommendations in their fifth status report that was submitted to the Supreme Court Tuesday, three days prior to the next hearing.

The report mentioned that Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke were removed from their posts of the BCCI president and secretary, respectively, through an order of apex court on January 2 and that “it was only fair” the current office-bearers be treated in the “same manner”.

“The current office-bearers of the BCCI have demonstrated scant regard for the directions issued by the Committee of Administrators and continue to flout the same with impunity,” the report reads. It further reports that the actions of the constituent members of the BCCI constituted “wilful disobedience” and demonstrated “overall resistance” to the Supreme Court’s order.

The CoA has also came down hard on the cricket board members for deliberately subverting the court directives during the BCCI’s July 26 Special General Meeting (SGM). They also lambasted BCCI CEO Rahul Johri’s exclusion along with that of the legal team from the last SGM, for which the Committee had show-caused the office-bearers.

“…the office-bearers instead of reprimanding the constituent members who were suggesting that BCCI officials including the CEO leave the meeting, did absolutely nothing. They came up with ingenious answers that CEO left of his own accord. Such a stand being taken by the office bearers is most unfortunate,” it stated.

The CoA directive mandated Johri’s presence at the meeting. The CEO was excluded citing the Supreme Court order that made only the state association/member office-bearers to attend the meeting. But the CoA felt that the decision was “pre-planned and orchestrated”.

The CoA pointed out how during the SGM, the high-court appointed Delhi and District Cricket Association Administrator, Justice (Retd) Vikramajit Sen, took a dig at the BCCI members saying, “There are some things the Lodha Committee had suggested and you are doing everything contrary to that.” The diversion tactics of the BCCI office-bearers also came for flak with the CoA noting, “The totally neutral expression ‘etc’ was treated as an excuse to bring in a series of issues aimed at unravelling the fundamental core of the reforms.”

Over the last six months, the CoA had tried to build consensus among members, informing them that it would be considerate towards one or two practical issues like three-member selection committee and one state-one vote.

But the BCCI SGM on July 26 objected to five points in the Lodha Committee recommendations — “One state-one vote; disqualifications of office-bearers (above 70 years of age and/or completing nine years with cooling-off periods); powers, duties and responsibilities of employers, office-bearers, functionaries, committees etc. (have to be dynamic and have to be decided by the board); number of selectors and constitution of the apex council.

No communication

The committee also mentioned another instance relating to the same SGM which showed the BCCI office bearers’ “impunity” revealing that they failed to communicate the decisions taken during the meeting to the Committee despite directions to that effect.

The CoA also flayed the general body for not adopting the new Conflict of Interest guidelines and the New Fund Disbursement Policy. The status report also spoke about prima facie “instances of malfeasance and misfeasance” of funds in certain state associations and asked for a committee to be appointed for investigation. They also recommended that the Supreme Court appoint an administrator in each state association to usher in reforms.

Indonesian president calls to safeguard pluralism from extremist threat,"(Source: Google maps) (Source: Google maps)

Indonesia’s president said on Wednesday that the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country needed to pull together to meet the threat of extremism and safeguard a constitution that enshrines religious freedom and diversity. In an address to parliament ahead of Thursday’s independence day, President Joko Widodo peppered his speech with references to the need to address inequality in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and tackle the threat of radicalism.

Indonesian police on Tuesday arrested five suspected Islamist militants and seized chemicals near the capital, Jakarta, that they said were being used to make bombs for attacks on the presidential palace at the end of August.

Religious tension in Indonesia has soared since late last year after Islamist-led rallies saw Jakarta’s then governor, a member of a so-called double minority who is ethnic Chinese and Christian, put on trial during city elections over claims he insulted the Koran.

“We want to work together not only in creating an equitable economy, but also in ideological, political, social and cultural development,” said Widodo. “In the field of ideology, we have to strengthen our national consensus in safeguarding Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, the unity of the Republic of Indonesia and “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” (unity in diversity),” he said.

Pancasila is Indonesia’s state ideology, which includes belief in god, the unity of the country, social justice and democracy, and which enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system. But there are worries about growing intolerance undermining a tradition of moderate Islam in a country where Muslims form about 85 percent of the population, alongside substantial Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and other minorities.

In April, the then Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of Widodo, lost the bitterly fought city election to a Muslim rival and was later jailed for blasphemy, a sentence rights groups and international bodies condemned as unfair and politicised. “Because the challenges we face now and will face in the future are not easy. We are still confronted with poverty and injustice; we are still facing global economic uncertainty, and we are also facing movements of extremism, radicalism and terrorism,” said Widodo.

The president said the government needed to ensure that all state agencies “gain the highest trust of the people” and noted he had set up a presidential taskforce to oversee the teaching of the state ideology Pancasila, particularly to the young.

Landslide kills 40 in northeast Democratic Republic of Congo,"village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert was left with 40 dead. (File) village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert was left with 40 dead. (File)

A landslide has swept over a fishing village on the banks of a lake in the northeast Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 40 people, a regional official said today. Part of a mountain engulfed “a fisherman’s camp after heavy rains caused a landslide” the deputy governor of Ituri province, Pacifique Keta, told AFP.

He said 40 people were killed in the disaster in the village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert on Wednesday. It follows devastating floods in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown on Monday that killed some 300 people.

“Yesterday, we buried 28 bodies and today we will bury 12 more,” said Keta.

A doctor at the nearby Tshomia hospital, Herve Isamba, said they were treating four people injured in the landslide. The vast country has experienced a number of previous such disasters. In May 2010, a mudslide that swept over the eastern village of Kibiriga killed 19 people: the bodies of 27 others were never recovered.

In February 2002, about 50 people were found dead after a wave of mud and rocks hit the eastern town of Uvira, submerging about 150 homes. Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. The province, rich in gold deposits, saw several outbreaks of violence during the Second Congo War between 1998 and 2003. That ended with the aid of a French-led international military intervention.

"After US questions China’s inaction, Beijing bans North Korean iron and seafood imports","The United Nations Security Council, including permanent member China, approved tough sanctions against North Korea on August 6 that could cost the country USD 1 billion a year. (Source: Reuters) The United Nations Security Council, including permanent member China, approved tough sanctions against North Korea on August 6 that could cost the country USD 1 billion a year. (Source: Reuters)

China will halt iron, iron ore and seafood imports from North Korea starting Monday, following through on new UN sanctions after US pressure for Beijing to strong arm Pyongyang over its ally’s nuclear programme. The decision was announced on Monday after days of increasingly bellicose rhetoric between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un’s regime, which has raised international alarm about where the crisis is headed.

Beijing had pledged to fully enforce the latest sanctions after the United States accused China of not doing enough to rein in its neighbour, which relies heavily on the Asian giant for its economic survival.

The Chinese commerce ministry said on its website that all imports of coal, iron, iron ore and seafood will be “completely prohibited” from Tuesday. Beijing had already announced a suspension of coal imports in February.

The United Nations Security Council, including permanent member Beijing, approved tough sanctions against Pyongyang on August 6 that could cost the country USD 1 billion a year.

The sanctions were in response to the North’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, after which Kim boasted that he could now strike any part of the United States. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi vowed after the UN sanctions were approved that his country “will for sure implement that new resolution 100 per cent, fully and strictly”.

China, which is suspected of failing to enforce past UN measures, accounts for 90 per cent of North Korea’s trade.

Trump complained in July that trade between the two nations had increased by nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter.

Beijing has defended its economic ties with Pyongyang as normal commerce between neighbours and insisted the trade did not violate UN sanctions.

The suspension of coal imports deprives North Korea of massive income as it totalled USD 1.2 billion last year. Among the latest banned products, China imported USD 74.4 million worth of iron ore in the first five months of this year, almost equalling the figure for all of 2016.

Fish and seafood imports totalled USD 46.7 million in June, up from USD 13.6 million in May. The United States angered China in June when it imposed unilateral sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean cash.

On Monday, Trump will formally order a probe into China’s intellectual property practices, though US officials said it was not linked to the North Korean matter. “It’s not appropriate to use one issue as a tool to keep pressure on the other issue,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing.

Regional tensions have soared in the past week as Trump warned North Korea it would face “fire and fury” if it attacked the United States, while the North threatened to test-fire its missiles over Japan and towards the US Pacific island of Guam.

Japan has deployed Patriot missile defences in four prefectures in response. “We will do our best to prevent (North Korea) from taking such acts by stepping up pressure through the UN,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday.

“The government’s heaviest responsibility is to secure our people’s lives.”

The war of words has sparked global concern, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides in a phone call with Trump over the weekend. South Korean President Moon Jae-In, a left-leaning leader who has previously advocated dialogue with the North, joined the appeals for restraint on Monday.

Moon called for an end to “all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further”.

The governor of Guam, Eddie Calvo, defended Trump’s rhetoric against Kim’s regime, saying in an interview with AFP that “sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in China has pleaded for a resumption of long-dormant six-nation talks to peacefully resolve the crisis.

But its proposal for North Korea to suspend its arms programmes in return for the United States to halt military drills in the region has been ignored. “The relevant parties should exercise restraint, in order to avoid aggravating the words and deeds of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua said.

Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: This Rana Daggubati film is a missed opportunity,"Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: It was very evident that Rana Daggubati’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake. Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: It was very evident that Rana Daggubati’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake.

Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie cast: Rana Daggubati, Kajal Aggarwal, Catherine Tresa

Nene Raju Nene Mantri director: Teja

Nene Raju Nene Mantri stars: 2 stars

In Nene Raju Nene Mantri, Radha Jogendra (Rana Daggubati) is introduced as a death row convict, whose last wish is to televise his life story. So, it begins, the story of an unambitious money lender, whose world revolves only around his beautiful wife Radha (Kajal Aggarwal).

Jogendra is a smart and cunning businessman. He is harmless until his wife is happy. But, if someone causes inconvenience to his wife, he or she must die. And he makes sure of it. Even it means playing the long game. Kajal suffers an abortion after her village Sarpanch’s wife pushes her down the stairs for lighting a lamp at a temple. It seems that lighting that lamp is a special privilege only enjoyed by Sarpanch’s wife. Now, one would expect Jogendra to lose his cool and storm the house of his village Sarpanch, played by Pradeep Rawat. But, instead, he decides to become a Sarpanch himself so that no one can stop his wife from lighting lamps at the temples. Thus, begins Jogendra’s tryst with politics.

After becoming sarpanch, Jogendra takes out the MLA of his constituency and assumes his office. He later replaces the home minister with the silliest plot that one could come up with. And now he aims for the chief ministership. Ask him, why is he doing all this? He will say that he’s doing it for Radha.

Jogendra began to play the power game in the politics to avenge his unborn child and for Radha. But, his actions that followed were purely out of his own ambition and greed. Jogendra’s justification that “Everything I did, I did for the family” (Radha) reminds me of Breaking Bad’s Walter White. A chemistry teacher with cancer begins to produce drugs to make just sufficient money so that his family can take care of themselves when he’s gone. But, he loses the way in the process. He does some horrible things for the sake of his family. But, eventually, he confesses to his wife that “All the things I did. I did it for me. I liked it.” The film lacking such a moment of truth, where Jogendra realises himself, leaves a big void in the story.

Kajal Aggarwal has delivered a convincing performance in the given role. While Catherine Tresa as Devika Rani, an owner of a news channel, is not explored to her full potential. Her role is meant to add scandal to this political drama. But, again Teja’s reservations has kept him from taking that character to a logical end.

It was very evident that Rana’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake. The audience knew that Jogendra was morally corrupt and he was ready to do wrong things to get what he wants. So, we expect him to up the ante in being the ‘bad guy’ and surprise us by doing some shocking things. But, director Teja, for some reasons, has not gone all the way in exploring the possibilities of things a character like Jogendra, who is drunk on power, greed and arrogance, could do.

Teja rather tries to sort of justify all the wrong actions of Jogendra. And blames the corrupt system of the country for all his crimes. It seems like Teja sort of lost his vision for Jogendra’s character. The film suffers from the director’s reservations to show what Jogendra really is, a power-hungry monster. He hurts his wife by sleeping with some other woman. He kills his close confidante, who saved his life multiple times, without even giving him a chance to explain his story. He kills cops. He murders anyone who stands in his way. He blows up a building full of politicians. And eventually, he is portrayed as people’s man.

The viewers who heard his life story on television are now convinced that he is the right person for the Chief Minister’s chair and wants the President to pardon him for killing the MLAs. Teja’s attempt to underplay the gravity of crimes Jogendra committed leads to a cringe-worthy climax and leaves the audience confused as to what the director was trying to establish.

Schoolgirl strangulated to death in park,"A class 12 student was allegedly strangulated to death by a man at a park in north-west Delhi’s Rohini area as he did not approve her talking to her other male friends, the police said on Thursday. The incident was reported on Wednesday. The accused, Sarthak Kapoor (18), was not in favour of the girl talking to her other friends, they said.

He used to often visit her school and fight with her friends, too, the police said. The 17-year-old girl was a bright student and had secured 10 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in Class 10. The accused was the victim’s senior at school. He passed out this year, they said.

On Wednesday, Kapoor picked up the girl from her coaching institute at Rohini’s Sector 17 as he wanted to “talk to her”, the police said. He took her to a lane near a housing society where they had a scuffle over some issue and he strangulated her, they said, adding that the accused panicked and fled the spot.

When the girl did not return home, her father called up her friends, but could not trace his daughter. He also tried to reach Kapoor, but he did not respond, the police said. They said that he then reached the accused’s residence and asked him whether he was aware about his the girl’s whereabouts.

Kapoor pretended to look for her by asking help from her other friends. However, the police grew suspicious and questioned him about the girl’s whereabouts, they said.

Initially, he hesitated, but later confessed to killing the girl, the police claimed, adding that he has been arrested. He also took the police to the spot where he had strangulated her, they said.

The victim’s father told the police that Kapoor would often harass the girl, and even though she tried to maintain distance from him, he would keep on approaching her. Kapoor is pursuing Bachelor in Computer Application (BCA) from an institute in Rohini.

Police on Thursday sounded a high alert after the Delhi High Court received a bomb threat. Reports say the Delhi Police received a call at around 10.45 am, claiming that a bomb was planted inside the court premises. The caller purportedly said the blast will take place within the hour.

However, the call was found to be a hoax, police told news agency PTI. They are on the lookout for the caller who has since switched off his phone.

The court complex hasn’t been placed under lock down. Vehicles, visitors and lawyers are being allowed to freely enter and exit the premises.

In 2010, an explosion went off inside the Delhi Court. Additional layers of security were added following the blast.

Maria Sharapova given wildcard entry to US Open 2017,"This will the Russian’s first Grand Slam in over a year with her last appearance coming at the Australian Open in 2016. This will the Russian’s first Grand Slam in over a year with her last appearance coming at the Australian Open in 2016.

Maria Sharapova has been granted a wild-card invitation for the US Open’s main draw. According to AP, Sharapova is among the eight women who have been made part of the 128-player field for the Grand Slam by the US Tennis Association. This will the Russian’s first Grand Slam in over a year with her last appearance coming at the Australian Open in 2016.

In the intervening months, Sharapova tested positive for newly banned drug meldonium which led to imposition of a 15-month ban. Sharapova stated that the she had been unaware of the status of the substance. The ban expired in April and since then she has been offered wildcards to play in a few tournaments on the WTA Tour. However, Sharapova was refused a wildcard at the French Open and she confirmed she will miss Wimbledon later in the year due to injury. Her preparations for the US Open have also been hampered by an arm injury. It forced her to withdraw from the the Rogers Cup and the ongoing Cincinnati Open as a precautionary measure before the final grand slam of the year.

Other wild card entrants for the tournament include Americans Taylor Townsend, Kayla Day, Sofia Kenin, Ashley Kratzer, Brienne Minor and France’s Amandine Hesse. Sharapova has won five Grand Slam titles which include two at the French Open and one each at Wimbledon, US Open and Australian Open. She has been ranked no. 1 on the WTA rankings on five separate occasions.

"10 deaths in last two days in UP, toll now 33: Disaster management department","Around 120 villages have been affected in Balrampur, 113 in Bahraich and 52 in Gonda. (Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav) Around 120 villages have been affected in Balrampur, 113 in Bahraich and 52 in Gonda. (Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)

Casualties: S V S Gangarao, commissioner of the Devipatan Mandal, said four people have died in Bahraich, three in Balrampur and two people each in Shravasti and Gonda due to floods. “The deaths in Shravasti and Gonda were reported in the last two weeks, and the ones in the other two districts in last two days,” he said.

‘Deaths not exactly due to floods’: Kunal Silku, DM of Sidharthnagar, said, “We have recorded three deaths in the last three days, but they were not exactly due to floods. One died after a house collapsed on him, one died after drowning in a pond and one due to health issues.”

Villages hit: Of the 1,623 villages hit in 22 districts, at least 996 are inundated, according to the state disaster management department. S V S Gangarao, commissioner of the Devipatan Mandal, said water level is receding in Sravasti, where 124 villages have been affected. Around 120 villages have been affected in Balrampur, 113 in Bahraich and 52 in Gonda. Kunal Silku, DM of Sidharthnagar, said nearly 60 villages of around 160 in the district are inundated, but the situation is under control.

‘Water from Nepal biggest cause for flood’: “All of the affected rivers come from Nepal. All of the extra water, which Nepal is not able to contain, is coming to us,” said Brijesh Kumar, executive engineer, state irrigation department.

Relief and rescue work: Lunch packets, rice, pulses, salt, candles and kerosene oil being provided to the affected. Medical teams as well as teams of veterinary doctors also functional. In Sidharthnagar, three tehsils have been shifted and 30 motorboats have been made operational for relief and rescue purposes.

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India’s internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries’ judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed — so far, at least.

Balachandran’s book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was “certainly a lapse”. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. “What was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)”. It was a “leadership failure” of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn’t institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown “no interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security”. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for “immaturely” dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

ICC hires international security company to visit Pakistan,"Najam Sethi was recently elected as PCB chairman. (Source: AP) Najam Sethi was recently elected as PCB chairman. (Source: AP)

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has hired an international security company on a three-year contract in a bid to revive international cricket in Pakistan. This was confirmed by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi.

“It’s a step by the ICC for the revival of international cricket in Pakistan. The company is based in three countries – the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates – and has a good repute,” the dawn.com quoted Sethi as saying.

“A representative of the Federation of International Cricketers (FICA) will accompany the security company to personally monitor the security situation in Lahore,” he added.

As per the reports, the visit of this security team is scheduled to take place at the end of this month or in the starting of September

“It will be a four-day visit where the security company will work with the government of Punjab to get assurances that all the recommendations submitted by security experts of the different countries who visited Lahore to watch the final of the second Pakistan Super League (PSL) season have been incorporated by the government in its SOPs, or not,” Sethi said.

It may be recalled here that international cricket matches in Pakistan have been few and far since 2009 when the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by a group of gunmen. Though Zimbabwe did make a visit in 2015, but it didn’t really change the conditions of international cricket in the country.

According to a report in Cricbuzz, earlier, President of Sri Lanka cricket Thilanga Sumathipala had assured that they are ready to travel to Pakistan to play cricket “if all logistical and operational plans fall in place”.

“Cricket is a game of change, chance and chase” Sumathipala said. “The game today, and its following is very different to what it was 10 years ago and as administrators, we are faced with a different set of challenges to overcome. World cricket is in the hands of the unity of Asia. We need to respectfully understand each other’s problems and stand by each other. This is the spirit of the Asian Cricket Council,” he added.

"Gregor Dimitrov, Madison Keys reach Western and Southern Open’s third round","Gregor Dimitrov finished with 28 winners, twice as many as Feliciano Lopez. (Source: Reuters) Gregor Dimitrov finished with 28 winners, twice as many as Feliciano Lopez. (Source: Reuters)

Seventh-seeded Gregor Dimitrov defeated Feliciano Lopez 7-6 (5), 6-4 on Wednesday to reach the Western & Southern Open’s round of 16. Sixteenth-seeded Madison Keys easily reached the women’s round of 16 in Cincinnati for the first time on her fourth try, needing just 50 minutes to zoom past Daria Kasatkina 6-2, 6-1.

Keys, a right-hander who withdrew from last week’s Rogers Cup in Toronto with a left forearm injury, next will meet fourth-seeded Garbine Muguruza, the Wimbledon champion. “I definitely thought I played really well,” Keys said. “I don’t know if I was the zone, press, but everything was going well. It was falling into place, and I didn’t have to rush anything.”

Keys was happiest about finishing quickly in the humid, 80-some-degree conditions. I definitely didn’t want to be out there a long time,” she said. “I wasn’t out there that long, but I was still drenched. I was happy to get back inside into the air conditioning.”

After being forced to a tiebreak in the first set, Dimitrov raised his level of play in the second with 13 winners to Lopez’s four. Dimitrov finished with 28 winners, twice as many as Lopez.

Other seeded women reaching the third round in this U.S. Open warmup were eighth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Yulia Putintseva, and Anastasija Sevastova, with a 6-2, 7-5 win over Roberta Vinci. Qualifier Camila Giorgi advanced with a 7-6 (1), 5-7, 6-3 win over Daria Gavrilova.

Men reaching the third round on the third full day of play included David Ferrer, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-1 over Janko Tipsarevic, and Yuichi Sugita, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1 over qualifier Joao Sousa.

Viswanathan Anand finishes joint eighth in St Louis Rapid,"Vishwanathan Anand suffers a disappointing final round loss. Vishwanathan Anand suffers a disappointing final round loss.

Former world champion Viswanathan Anand suffered a disappointing final round loss against Sergey Karjakin of Russia to finish joint eighth in the St Louis Rapid Chess tournament here today.

After raising visions of a good finish, luck did not favour Grandmaster Anand much on the final day as he was first held to a draw by Le Quang Leim of Vietnam in the seventh round and then shared points with Fabiano Caruana of United States in the penultimate round.

The Indian ace ended on seven points, coming through one win, five draws and two losses in the event that gave two points for a win and one for a draw.

Levon Aronian of Armenia topped the rapid section with 12 points in all. On the final day, Aronian scored two good wins and a solitary draw.

The American duo of Hikaru Nakamura and Caruana were right behind Aronian on 11 points each and Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi was fourth on 10 points. Lenier Dominguez of Cuba was right behind on nine points.

Le Quang Leim and Sergey Karjakin shared the sixth spot on eight points each while Anand, Garry Kasparov and Navara David of Czech Republic shares the eighth position.

The event is still only half way through as the players will change gears again and play the blitz that will have eighteen games in all and the winner in the USD 150000 prize money tournament will be decided by the cumulative score.

For Anand, the road ahead looks difficult but things can still turn around if he can start off with a few wins in the blitz. A five-point margin is huge and the turnaround can only happen with some massive scoring by Anand.

Garry Kasparov was again the big news of the day simply with his presence. However, Kasparov, once the best player on the planet, could not keep pace with clock or pressure and lost two games besides getting lucky and winning one against Leim.

It was a heartbreak for the yesteryear champion as he simply lost from a won endgame through a super-trick from David Navara in the first game of the day. Le Quang Leim dropped a rook in the next game from a playable position to give Kasparov his only victory in the event thus far while Caruana proved stronger in what was a tricky endgame in the final round.

Standings after Rapid: 1. Levon Aronian (Arm, 12); 2-3: Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura (both USA) 11 each; 4. Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 8); 5. Lenier Dominguez (Cub, 9); 6-7. Sergey Karjakin (Rus), Le Qunag Leim (Vie) 8 each; 8-10: Garry Kasparov (Rus), V Anand (Ind), David Navara (Cze) 7 each.

Yemen crisis: Roadside bombing kills 12 civilians,"An attack wounded army General Ahmad al-Shbeili of the 115th brigade and killed his son. (Representational image) An attack wounded army General Ahmad al-Shbeili of the 115th brigade and killed his son. (Representational image)

A roadside explosion killed 12 civilians and wounded four in southern Yemen today when a bomb targeting a military car hit their vehicle instead, a security source said. Two other people, including a soldier, were killed today in separate attacks also in southern Yemen, where the army has launched an offensive against Al-Qaeda. The deadliest attack was in Daleh province.

“The bomb was planted on a road in the Qaataba district of Daleh and hit a civilian vehicle instead,” said a security source who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the press. Along with most of southern Yemen, Daleh is controlled by government forces loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who is allied with a Saudi-led Arab military alliance in a war against Iran-backed Huthi rebels. Yemeni special forces trained by the alliance member United Arab Emirates and backed by the United States this month launched a major operation in the southern Shabwa province against Yemen’s Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

AQAP has exploited years of conflict between the government and the rebels to expand its presence in southern Yemen. The jihadists are thought to have moved farther south into neighbouring Abyan province. An attack today wounded army General Ahmad al-Shbeili of the 115th brigade and killed his son in the town of Loder in Abyan. A source in the brigade told AFP Al-Qaeda gunmen were behind the deadly ambush. And a soldier was killed in the oil-rich Hadramawt province, east of Daleh and Abyan, when masked gunmen opened fire on a residential street, a security source there said.

AQAP regularly targets military outposts in southern Yemen. An Al-Qaeda suicide bomber killed five Yemeni soldiers and wounded 20 others in an attack last week on an army position in Loder.

"Sri Lanka cricket team is going through a rough patch, says Upul Tharanga","Upul Tharanga has asked fans for patience ahead of their upcoming ODIs and Twenty20 matches. Upul Tharanga has asked fans for patience ahead of their upcoming ODIs and Twenty20 matches.

Sri Lanka’s limited-overs captain Upul Tharanga has called upon fans for patience ahead of their upcoming ODIs and Twenty20 matches. Admitting that the cricket team representing the island nation is going through a rough patch, Tharanga also went on to remind the glorious past that the Sri Lankan side has seen.

Tharanga, who will be leading Sri Lanka in the upcoming one-day series against India, said, “Every team goes through a rough patch,” Tharanga said in a statement from Sri Lanka Cricket. “This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are. “Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years – don’t forget this now when we are going through a rough patch.”

Identifying the various areas for improvement, he said, “These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes – however, it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith,” Tharanga said. Sri Lanka have recalled all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana to their limited-overs squad and Tharanga was confident of defeating India.

“Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India,” he said and concluded by saying, “We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.”

Squad: Upul Tharanga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella (wicketkeeper), Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

"If Peter Handscomb performs wicketkeeping duties then Australia can play an extra spinner, says Adam Gilchrist","Former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist has suggested Handscomb take up wicketkeeping duties. (Source: Express Photo) Former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist has suggested Handscomb take up wicketkeeping duties. (Source: Express Photo)

Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has put in his suggestion of handing over the wicketkeeping responsibilities to young Peter Handscomb during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh. According to Gilchrist that such a move could allow Australia to play an extra spinner on tracks which will be conducive to spin bowling.

Speaking to the media, he said, “It’s just about balance and what you think is the right balance to get the Test match victory in the conditions you’re going to. The opportunity to play the extra spin bowler, and if you can do it not necessarily at the cost of one of your seamers or an out-and-out batter, it becomes a realistic proposition.

Commenting on Handscomb’s ability with the ball, he said, “He’s certainly very, very capable with the gloves and a foundation of having been a junior wicketkeeper is going to help him in regards to if he’s going to have to do any long stints with it. If he’s saying he’s keen and available and happy to do it that tells me he feels he can because he’s got no need to justify his position in the team as a batsman. He’s doing that well and truly.

It maybe recalled here that Handscomb has had prior experience in first class cricket where he has fulfilled duties behind the stumps.

When Handscomb was asked his view, he said, “was doing some white-ball keeping for Yorkshire in England as well. Ultimately I’m happy to do it if it’s good for team balance if it opens up a position for another bowler or batter to come into the side. But first and foremost I’ve always said that batting is my number one (priority), and ‘keeping plays second fiddle.”

Grand stage rises for late Thai king’s cremation,"In this Aug. 8, 2017 photo, dark clouds loom over the construction of the royal crematorium for the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Sanam Luang in Bangkok, Thailand. (AP Photo/File) In this Aug. 8, 2017 photo, dark clouds loom over the construction of the royal crematorium for the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Sanam Luang in Bangkok, Thailand. (AP Photo/File)

Mythical creatures, angels and gods are coming to life near Thailand’s Grand Palace, thanks to the tireless, devout and often volunteer work of artists and craftsmen. They are building a monument for a single moment: the cremation of a beloved king.

More than 100 sculptures and statues will be placed inside a crematorium complex for King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years before his death Oct. 13, 2016. The structure represents Mount Meru, the place where Buddhist and Hindu gods reside.

Bhumibol was revered by many Thais as their father and a demigod. Huge crowds lined the route when a cortege took his body to the Grand Palace the day after his death, and millions have paid their respects at the throne hall where his body rests in a royal urn.

He will be cremated this Oct. 26 in a ceremony that is expected to be beamed around the world and will be one of the most expensive in history with a budget of 1 billion baht ($30 million). Afterward, the crematorium will be dismantled.

For the millions of Thais who loved the king, what matters is more personal _ how they can contribute to his final goodbye.

Amid a clatter of hammers and a deafening whirr of metal grinders, nine elegant, elaborate pavilions have arisen on a field opposite the Grand Palace. The construction is ahead of schedule and the funeral preparations are nearly complete, according to the country’s Fine Arts Department.

“Many (artists) who are here are loyal and faithful to the late king,” said Surathkij Pheeraphongsil, a director in the department. “Nobody complains about difficulties or about being tired because the late king endured more than us.”

At the Fine Arts Department, close by the cremation site, the artisans, craftsmen and artists painstakingly apply the last layers of paint to an array of deities and creatures from ancient epics. Statues of former kings of Thailand, already completed, stand to one side.

Many of the artists are providing their skills for free.

“This event has brought together talented artists from across the country to create the most amazing art pieces for the late king,” said painter Charoen Marboot.

For 23-year-old Waritha Songtua, a recent art graduate _ hard at work on a wood carving _ there’s a strong element of duty in the work she’s undertaking.

“As a Thai who has an ability in art, I can use it to give back to the country, because to conserve art and culture is like protecting the nation,” she said.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, Bhumibol’s son and successor, is set to have his formal coronation before the end of the year.

Delhi shooter attacked by wasps at Karni Singh Range,"Delhi pistol shooter Lovleen Kaur was stung by a swarm of wasps while training at Karni Singh Shooting Range which, she said, did not have a first aid facility.

Kaur said she was attacked by a group of wasps and bitten by at least four of them at different parts of her body while doing practice at the 25m range yesterday.

“I got stung by four wasps at the range. I went ahead to change the template but got attacked by a swarm of wasps. I was feeling dizzy and numb for a while. After that, my face turned red and started swelling. I was feeling a stinging sensation the whole body,” she said in a statement today.

“There was no first aid (facility) at this world class shooting range. Only a lady sweeper helped me though some male shooters and a guard was present at that time. Actually, not many people were there and the few people who were there were all males. So may be, that’s why nobody came forth.

“The guard gave me a steel scale to rub it over the skin. And a sweeper (lady) helped me with packing my stuff. Thank god, it did not happen while I was shooting at my lane.

Otherwise with a loaded pistol in my hand, any mishap could have happened,” she added.

Lovleen’s father Ishwinderjeet Singh said, “She came back home with her face and legs swollen a bit, and slightly fever was also there. It is a serious problem at the range. I would request the concerned authorities to take up the issue.

“I would also file a formal complaint about it. She was given anti-allergic medicine by our family doctor.

“If the wasps had attacked her in more numbers, it could at times be fatal also,” he added.

Ace marksman and Indian junior shooting team chief coach Jaspal Rana said, “This is a reason for concern. Imagine if some shooter is at the shooting bay with a loaded weapon and at that time such thing happens, it could be very dangerous.”

Speaking of Ramanujan,"When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez. When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary — urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‘Fear No Fall’, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‘possession’.

What makes Rodriguez’s volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR’s own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‘both context sensitive and reflexive’, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet — chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR’s journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‘Between’ becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as “the hyphen in Indo-American studies”.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself “a multiple monolingual”. In another: “It looks as if I live between things all the time — two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.” Or, yet again: “The whole question of roots is not relevant to me… India is me and with me…” And again, ‘It takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.’

AKR’s image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: “[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky… Each had a literature that was unlike the others…and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.”

There is no cultural machismo here — no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky — always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‘have to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet’. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet’s capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary — more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May to lead business delegation to Japan,"British Prime Minister Theresa May. (Source: AP Photo) British Prime Minister Theresa May. (Source: AP Photo)

British Prime Minister Theresa May will visit Japan this month for talks with her Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe to discuss Brexit, trade and defence, her office said on Tuesday. May will lead a business delegation drawn from a range of different sectors on the trip, which comes as her government looks to strengthen its relationship with key international investors ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“The delegation will showcase the strength of British business, the shared confidence in the UK-Japan economic relationship as we leave the EU, and the potential for future growth,” a spokesman from May’s office said.

The three-day trip begins on Aug. 30.

Japanese companies including carmaker Nissan and conglomerate Hitachi have invested more than 40 billion pounds ($52 billion) in Britain, and Japanese companies employ a total of 140,000 people in the country.

May’s office did not give details of which businesses would be travelling to Japan. May will also meet Emperor Akihito, the spokesman said.

Since voting to leave the EU last June Britain has trumpeted decisions by Japanese carmakers Nissan and Toyota to continue production in the country as a sign that Brexit will not scare off international investors.

But both those investments came after the government wrote letters to ease the firms’ concerns, drawing criticism that May was making secret deals and giving firms privileged information on Brexit. Britain said the letters were commercially sensitive.

May and Abe, leaders of the world’s fifth and third largest economies, met last month on the sidelines of an international summit in Germany, and in April she hosted him at her English country residence.

After Abe’s April visit, he expressed concerns about possible overnight changes in regulations when Britain withdraws from the EU in March 2019 – the latest in a series of unusually strong declarations about the risks of Brexit from Tokyo.

Suffering from lower back pain? A new smart underwear may help,"The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo) The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo)

Scientists have developed a smart, mechanised undergarment that can help reduce stress and pain on the lower back muscles. Engineers at the Vanderbilt University in the US combined biomechanics and advances in wearable technology to create the undergarment. Over half of all adults will experience low back pain in their lifetimes, researchers said. The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs.

The sections are connected by sturdy straps across the middle back, with natural rubber pieces at the lower back and glutes. The device is designed so that users engage it only when they need it. A simple double tap to the shirt engages the straps. When the task is done, another double tap releases the straps so the user can sit down, and the device feels and behaves like normal clothes. The device also can be controlled by an app that the team created users tap their phones to engage the smart clothing wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Eight subjects tested the device leaning forward and lifting weights while holding their position at 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Using motion capture, force plates and electromyography, researchers showed that the device reduced activity in the lower back extensor muscles by an average of 15-45 per cent for each task. The team’s testing proved that the smart clothing offloads stress on the low back. The focus of the technology is not to treat those with existing back pain but to prevent it by reducing stress and fatigue on the low back muscles.

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother’s wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‘cheerharan’ by the Kauravas.

There’s another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement leaders jailed for participating in pro-democracy protests,"Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, right, and Nathan Law, left, speak outside the high court before a ruling on a prosecution request for stiffer sentences following a lower court decision that let them avoid prison in Hong Kong on Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017.

(AP Photo)

Joshua Wong and two other young leaders of Hong Kong’s huge Umbrella Movement rallies in 2014 were jailed today for their role in the pro-democracy protests. Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow were sentenced to six months, eight months and seven months respectively after the Court of Appeal upped their previous non-custodial sentences. Activists say the case is more proof that Beijing is tightening its grip on the semi-autonomous city. Wong shouted: “Hong Kong people, don’t give up!” as he was led away by security.

Hong Kong enjoys much greater freedoms than on the mainland, with its liberties enshrined in the handover agreement made when the city was given back to China by Britain in 1997. But there are growing concerns Beijing is trampling the deal.

All three defendants were found guilty last year on unlawful assembly charges for storming a fenced-off government forecourt known as “Civic Square” as part of a protest calling for fully free leadership elections in September 2014. Their arrests sparked wider rallies which exploded two days later when police fired tear gas on the crowds, triggering mass demonstrations that brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for more than two months in an unprecedented challenge to Beijing.

Wong and Law received community sentences and Chow a three-week suspended sentence at magistrates’ court last August over the Civic Square protest. But Hong Kong’s justice department then sought to overturn those terms, with prosecutors arguing they should receive harsher punishment.

In emotional scenes before the judgement, tearful supporters hugged the three and chanted: “Shame on political persecution!” Around 20 pro-Beijing supporters shouted back through loudspeakers, chanting “Pay the price in jail!”

Ahead of the judgement today, the department of justice said there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive” on its part in relation to the case.

"Deepika Padukone’s colour-block shirt isn’t impressive at all, but her denims are way too cool","Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries) Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Looks like simple button-down shirts are a thing of the past now. We were still trying to get our heads around how to pair a deconstructed shirt but with fashion trends changing so often, we were presented with a new dilemma – on how to wear a colour-block shirt. In all fairness, if we would have spotted this dual-tone summer wear while out shopping, we would have never gone for it. But Deepika Padukone being the fashion chameleon she is, decided to add it to her wardrobe. She stepped out at the airport in a half gingham print and half pastel blue shirt and even though we applaud her for her sartorial experiment, it just failed to impress us.

However, she totally aced her denim game in the fanciest and coolest pair ever! The 70s-inspired flared jeans are having a huge moment right now and Padukone took it to the next level with this one – we love how it’s frayed at the ankles.

You can pair it with almost anything, starting from statement tees to tank tops and halter-necks – just make sure that your top isn’t baggy. You can complement your look like the Padmavati actor with a pair of Nike slides, minimum make-up, an updo and a pair of sunglasses.

This particular travel look isn’t our favourite but a couple of days back, she aced her airport style in basics.

The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look. The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It’s something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

India’s victory over colonialism an inspiration for Africa: SA minister,"A child holds a South African, left, and Indian flag as she awaits the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who visited Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg Friday, July 8, 2016 where he opened the Mandela Gandhi exhibition.

India’s struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination served as an inspiration for the countries across Africa, South African Minister of Post and Telecommunications Siyabonga Cwele has said. He was speaking at a dinner hosted by Indian High Commissioner Ruchira Kamboj in Pretoria to mark the country’s 71st Independence Day.

“India took up the cause of championing the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination and served as a rock of support upon which South Africa could rely until our own date with destiny,” Cwele said last night as he quoted from the famous speech by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

“South Africa and India share a strategic partnership that saw bilateral trade top the 93 billion mark in 2016, however the true potential of our trade, tourism and investment relations is yet to be fully realised,” Cwele said as he called for a further deepening of these relations.

The minister said both India and South Africa had issued a ten-year business visa to facilitate trade relations. “As South Africa assumes the chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association, we look forward to collaborating with India in expanding in new areas of marketing efforts and intensified people-to-people contact.

“Cwele said 2017 was a special year for bilateral relations because it marked the 20th anniversary of the Red Fort Agreement signed by former President Nelson Mandela and Prime Minister Deve Gowda in New Delhi and reaffirmed the strategic partnership between the two countries.

“It set out the aspirations and ideas which we as members of the South strive for,” Cwele concluded.

“The relationship between India and South Africa is truly special – it stands for peace in a time of turmoil; serves as a platform for collaboration in a time of chaos; and above all, is an alliance of trust and conviction,” Kamboj reaffirmed.

On the occasion, violin maestro L Subramaniam played a piece specially composed and performed together with Lord Yehudi Menuhin for India’s 40th Independence Day celebrations, this time with his son, Ambi Subramaniam. They received a standing ovation from more than 300 guests who were present at the dinner.

Cricketer S Sreesanth, who faced allegations of spot-fixing before being exonerated by the Kerala High Court, today played an unsanctioned exhibition match involving members of Malayalam film industry.

The Kerala High Court had recently ordered BCCI to lift the life ban imposed on him but the Board has decided to appeal to a larger bench of the Court.

He unfurled the national flag and was presented with a bouquet before the match. Sreesanth, who looked distinctly unfit batted well against the amateur attack.

“I am really happy that I am back and I am beginning my return from the same ground where it all began. Now from here, I want to reach Thiruvananthapuram and from there upwards and back to the Indian team,” said Sreesanth, though it looks very difficult at this point in time.

Sreesanth has played in 27 Tests taking 87 wickets. He also has 75 wickets from 53 One-Day Internationals and seven wickets from 10 T20 Internationals.

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‘Orientalism’ is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said’s book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said’s argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon — it’s a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum’s Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being “on the outer verge of civilisation” and that she had no hesitation in calling them “uncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.” In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma’s endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma’s central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said’s Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma’s suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler’s Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

The government must take action. Miscreants are having a free run in Bengal. This is an act of sacrilege.” (Representational Image)

Two persons were held on Wednesday in connection with the defacement of a bust of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on August 14, according to police. The incident took place in Khairasol area of Birbhum, where the bust was to be inaugurated on Independence Day.

Police arrested Maida Bauri and Vinod Das, residents of Panchla village, and are questioning them. “We have arrested two and interrogation is on. We are yet to find a motive. The statue had been installed within the panchayat office premises, and the place is in a remote area. There is no CCTV, and the incident took place at night.

“Therefore, it is not easy to find eyewitnesses. Hopefully we will crack the case soon,” said N Sudheer Kumar, Superintendent of Police (Birbhum).

Speaking to mediapersons, BJP leader and Netaji’s grandnephew Chandra Bose said: “It is a shameful and unfortunate incident. The government must take action. Miscreants are having a free run in Bengal. This is an act of sacrilege.”

The cement bust, made at a cost of Rs 1.36 lakh, was placed on a decorated podium inside the Khairasol panchayat office on August 14. Police said villagers had seen the bust intact till the evening that day. However, on the morning of August 15, villagers and panchayat members allegedly discovered that the bust had been defaced.

Dinabandhu Das, a group D staff member in the panchayat office, alerted police, sources said. As the news spread, irate locals protested and demanded the immediate arrest of the culprits.

“We decided to celebrate Independence Day with a lot of fanfare, and the statue was put up as a part of it. We cannot imagine that people would do such a deed. Have asked police to find the anti-national people soon,” said Sonali Bakshi, panchayat pradhan. Police sources said they are not ruling out the possibility of sabotage by a group to create tension in the area.

Man held for ‘raping’ estranged wife in Bhavnagar,"A case has been registered in the matter, said the police. A case has been registered in the matter, said the police.

Police have arrested a man for allegedly abducting and raping his estranged wife in Bhavnagar after they found her at Hadambtala village in Botad on August 2. The woman’s father-in-law has also been arrested. “We have booked a case under section 376 (B) and other provisions of the IPC,” said T S Rizvi, Investigation Officer at Vallabhipur police station in Bhavnagar.

Section 376 (B) of the IPC is related to sexual intercourse with wife by husband during separation and it entails punishment of 2 to 7 years in jail. Officials at the state crime records bureau said that the provision has been rarely used. (See box)

The accused, who is in the Indian Army, married the woman three years ago. It was an arranged marriage.

“Within three months of our marriage, he started hitting me. At first, he used hands to hit me, but then he started using sticks and then whatever he could find. I would often run to my parents’ home with a black eye or a broken hand. I tried to make the marriage work for a year, but then I could not,” said the woman who had filed a case of harassment against her husband in 2016. Since then she has been living with her parents.

“On July 28, when I got down from the bus and was walking towards my office, a Wagon R came near me. My husband jumped out of the car and pulled me inside. Before I could realise what had happened, he hit me with a helmet and gagged me with a cloth. My father-in-law was driving the car. I tried to reach for my phone but could not manage,” she told The Indian Express.

“First my husband and father-in-law took me to a hut in a field. My father-in-law tied me up and went out. My husband then removed my clothes and forced himself on me twice. After that he used sticks to beat me up,” she said. According to her, she was blindfolded and taken to a flat where her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law were present. “They tied me up. My husband would keep me naked and force himself on me whenever he felt like. He took nude pictures of me and said that he would put it on the Internet if I complained to the police… I would scream in pain as he used sticks to beat me every time after raping me. My in-laws would listen to my screams and do nothing. They had told my husband to ensure that he impregnates me so that I can’t seek divorce,” she said.

According to the woman’s brother, one of her colleagues who had seen her being dragged into a car informed them about the abduction. “We told the police immediately, they told us to wait till evening. When my sister did not return home that night, we filed a complaint and an FIR was filed,” he added. Police found the woman from Hadambtala village in Botad on August 2.

“We suspected the in-laws. We got information that her father-in-law was spotted at Hadambtala village and we decided to chase him. He led us to the house where she was kept,” said Rizvi. “She was rushed to a hospital as she was bleeding in her private parts and was unable to walk,” he added. The husband and father-in-law were sent to judicial custody on Friday after they were questioned by the police for a week.

Tamil Nadu CM says Jayalalithaa’s death will be probed by commission headed by retired judge,"Tamil Nadu’s former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa’s mortal remains being carried during her funeral procession in Chennai on Tuesday. (PTI Photo by R Senthil Kumar) Tamil Nadu’s former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa’s mortal remains being carried during her funeral procession in Chennai on Tuesday. (PTI Photo by R Senthil Kumar)

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced that a commission headed by a retired judge will investigate the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. Jayalalithaa died on December 5 last year after suffering a cardiac arrest at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai where she had been admitted on September 22 following complaints of fever and dehydration. There were reports alleging foul play behind the death of the AIADMK supremo. The name of the judge, who will head the inquiry commission, will be announced later, Palaniswami told reporters.

Additionally, the chief minister has announced that Veda Nilayam, the Poes Garden residence of Jayalalithaa, will be turned into a memorial dedicated to her life and career. The museum will be thrown open for public viewing.

Both the decisions were major demands raised by the AIADMK faction led by former CM O Panneerselvam ahead of the merger of the two groups, the other one led by Palaniswami. A factional war had broken out soon within the party after the death of Jayalalithaa and the subsequent elevation of Sasikala, her longtime aide, to the powerful general secretary post.

However, standing in the way of the proposed merger of the two factions is TTV Dinakaran, the nephew of VK Sasikala who organised a massive rally in Melur village near Madurai. Dinakaran’s rally was attended by 23 MLAs and 4 MPs of the ruling party and has the potential to spoil the merger of the two factions and even bring down the government. The ouster of Dinakaran and the family of Sasikala from the party is another condition put forward by the Panneerselvam faction for the merger to take place.

If the proposed merger happens, Palaniswami could continue as the chief minister with Panneerselvam taking charge as general secretary of the party and even assuming the role of deputy CM.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey submitted a formal note demanding fugitive Adil Oksuz’s extradition.

Oksuz, accused of being a follower of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, is believed to have played a key part in the failed coup. Gulen denies accusations of involvement in the attempt. “If this person is there, we asked that he be located, taken into custody and returned to Turkey,” Cavusoglu said.

German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer confirmed that the request had been received and would be reviewed “on the basis of the law,” but said it wasn’t clear whether Oksuz was actually in Germany. Schaefer told reporters that Germany was aware of the allegations against Oksuz, but that authorities would “stick to what concrete, credible and verifiable information” is provided to them.

The request comes amid souring relations between the two countries. Turkey accuses Germany of providing a safe haven to Kurdish militants and suspects wanted for alleged links to the coup. Germany has protested the arrest of several of its citizens in Turkey since the coup, including two journalists and a human rights activist. Schaefer said Germany’s ambassador

Schaefer said Germany’s ambassador in Turkey is scheduled to meet Tuesday with German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who was detained in February on suspicion of aiding forbidden groups.

Ambassador Martin Erdmann planned to visit German human rights campaigner Peter Steudtner on Wednesday, Schaefer said. Steudtner and Ali Gharavi of Sweden were arrested July 5 during a raid on a Turkish hotel where they were teaching a digital security workshop.

They were among six activists, including Amnesty International’s Turkey director Idil Eser, detained last month for allegedly aiding an unspecified armed terror group.

"Gujarat: Nitin Patel finished second and now, a ‘cold war’ brews","State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo) State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo)

For the Gujarat BJP, appointing a deputy chief minister was unprecedented. But ,the manner in which Nitin Patel got the post last August, spoke a great deal about the machinations that go on in the BJP. His announcement as Rupani’s deputy came in the wake of “almost confirmed” news that he will succeed Anandiben Patel as chief minister. Nitin Patel, 61-year-old leader of Mehsana, had also started giving interviews to news channels which began flashing news about the “impending announcement” as he began accepting congratulations from anchors and reporters alike. It seemed politically logical too — the Patidars were angry with the BJP government over quota demand and the police action they faced. This, however, didn’t happen. BJP president Amit Shah prevailed over other senior leaders at a meeting in Gandhinagar, and Rupani was given the top job.

The news surprised all. Rupani was a first time MLA unlike Nitin Patel who had served in various BJP governments since 1995.

One year down the line, sources say, a “cold war” is still brewing between the CM and his deputy. The sources give accounts of Cabinet meetings where the “differences” between the two leaders frequently surface. And, on most occasions Rupani manages to ignore it.

“Yes, a cold war is definitely there between the two. And many a times, even government officers face the brunt of it,” says a source close to the functioning of the offices of the CM and the Deputy CM.

Indicating the strained relationship between the top two in the government, an official said, “Take the recent floods in Banaskantha and Patan districts for example. The CM has taken a lead in relief and rehabilitation of the affected areas. Nitinbhai has remained almost aloof from the relief operations.” The latest issue of the state government’s fortnightly magazine — Gujarat, which was devoted to the flood — is full of pictures of the chief minister, whereas the presence of the Deputy CM is almost negligible.

“The Deputy CM did not participate much, so how can there be his pictures in it (the magazine),” said a government functionary.

Even as Rupani was camping along with his 10 ministers in the flood-affected areas for five days, Patel was also not handling the day-to-day government in Gandhinagar in CM’s absence. When reached, Nitin Patel dismissed talks of his differences with the chief minister or the brewing cold war between them.

“I have been in public life for the last 30 years. I do not pay heed to such bogus talks,” he said, dismissing claims that he did not visit the rain-affected areas. “I visited Radhanpur and Kankrej. As far as photographs (in Gujarat magazine) are concerned, I do not go to such places to get photographed…I had the responsibility of coordinating the entire state. While Banaskantha and Patan received heavy rain, so did places like Kalol. But, due to the intense gravity of flood situation in Banaskantha and Patan, they (Kalol and other places) got eclipsed… I was also actively involved in finalising the relief package,” said Patel.

US designates two top ISIS leaders as ‘global terrorists’,"Representational image. Representational image.

The US today designated two top Islamic State leaders, one of whom involved in the deadly 2015 Paris and 2016 Brussels attacks, as ‘global terrorists’ as they pose a significant risk to America. Ahmad Alkhald, a Syrian national, is an ISIS bomb-maker responsible for the deaths of numerous civilians in Europe. Abu Yahya al-Iraqi, also known as Iyad Hamed Mahl al-Jumaily, is a senior ISIS figure who reports to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

These designations seek to deny Alkhald and Al-Iraqi the resources they need to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks, the State Department said. Among other consequences, all of Alkhald’s and Al-Iraqi’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and Americans are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them.

The State Department said Alkhald is the explosives chief of the terrorist cell that carried out the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the March 2016 attacks in Brussels. Alkhald travelled to Europe where he helped plan the Paris attacks and manufacture the explosive belts used in that plot, which killed and injured hundreds of people, including a number of Americans.

Following his return to Syria shortly before the attacks in Paris, Alkhald continued to guide ISIS operatives in Europe on making the bombs used in the March 2016 Brussels attacks. Alkhald is wanted internationally and a European warrant for his arrest has been issued.

On the other hand, Al-Iraqi has reportedly played a key role in security for Al-Baghdadi and oversees ISIS security in Iraq and Syria, the State Department said. The US has so far designated over 30 ISIS leaders and operatives.

“These designations are part of a larger comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS that, in coordination with the 73-member Global Coalition, has made significant progress towards that goal.

“This whole-of-government effort is destroying ISIS in its safe havens, denying its ability to recruit foreign terrorist fighters, stifling its financial resources, negating the false propaganda it disseminates over the internet and social media and helping to stabilise liberated areas in Iraq and Syria so the displaced can return to their homes and begin to rebuild their lives,” said the State Department.

Ronald Koeman backs record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost Everton attack,"Ronald Koeman also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered. (Source: File) Ronald Koeman also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered. (Source: File)

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said he expects Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost the club’s goal-scoring options after the attacking-midfielder completed his medical before he transfers from Swansea City.

Sigurdsson will move to Goodison Park after the two clubs agreed on a fee of about 45 million pounds ($57.84 million), a record for Everton, according to the British media.

The 27-year-old played a key part in Swansea’s avoiding relegation last season, scoring nine goals and 13 assists. “The latest is that he had his medical this morning. What I heard from the doctor was no problem,” Koeman told a news conference before the Europa League first-leg playoff against Croatian side Hajduk Split on Thursday.

“We worked a long time to get this deal in and he was one of the key players to bring in. We knew would lose Lukaku for this season and we need players who bring productivity to the team.

Romelu Lukaku moved to Manchester United last month, for a reported transfer fee of 75 million pounds. Sigurdsson “is the type of player with a lot of productivity, Koeman said. “In my opinion, he is one of the best in the Premier League.”

The manager also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered in training last week.

Barkley, who is in the final year of his contract, refused a new deal at the club and Koeman said last month he would be sold in the current transfer window.

“He stopped training last Monday,” Koeman said. “It looks like a hamstring injury, but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.”

Following their Europa League encounter at Goodison Park, Everton visit Manchester City in the league on Monday.

Vadodara residents displaced by demolition to restart stir,"A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File) A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File)

Close to six months after an in situ rehabilitation project under Rajiv Awas Yojana for the displaced of a November 2014 demolition drive in Kalyannagar here was stalled for want of funds — as claimed by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) — the 550 families, mostly Muslims, are gearing up to restart their agitation for “justice”.

The VMC has, however, proposed the residents to consider relocation to Tandalja, which the families see as being “pushed into a Muslim ghetto”. Besides, they claim that the VMC has not given their rental allowance for June and July.

In a memorandum submitted to Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Vinod Rao on Tuesday, their representative J S Bandukwala demanded that their rehabilitation be done in accordance to the word given by the VMC and the local MLAs in 2015.

Bandukwala also raised the issue of rents. “Most families are poor and pay high rents in Fatehgunj, Gorwa and Navayard.” The memorandum reminded the VMC of maladministration and possible corruption in the use of funds meant for construction of the in situ homes, as cited by the civic body, bringing the project to a halt.

Rao had instituted an inquiry against F J Charpot, then executive engineer of affordable housing scheme, for escalation in the project cost, which went up from Rs 80 crore to Rs 150 crore.

When contacted, Rao said, “The discussion (about shifting the families to Tandalja) is on. Some families have agreed to shift and others will agree in coming days.”

Regarding the site at Kalyannagar, Rao said, “We will have to begin a process for cost recovery through auctioning. Any party, who is interested in completing the project, will be considered so that the project can be put to use.”

"Arsenal want Alexis Sanchez, not sure whether Chelsea want Diego Costa, says Arsene Wenger","Alexis Sanchez scored 30 goals in all competitions as Arsenal lifted the FA Cup but endured an underwhelming league campaign. (Source: AP) Alexis Sanchez scored 30 goals in all competitions as Arsenal lifted the FA Cup but endured an underwhelming league campaign. (Source: AP)

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Wednesday that there was no comparison between the situations of forwards Alexis Sanchez with the Gunners and Diego Costa with reigning champions Chelsea. Wenger said that they want Sanchez but he was not sure whether Chelsea want Spaniard Costa.

Sanchez had made his desire to leave Arsenal public by saying that he wants to move to a club that can help him win the Champions League. “We have to make a choice between efficiency on the field and financial interests and most of the time you can find a compromise,” said Wenger. “In this case, I prioritise the fact that he will be useful on the sporting side.”

Costa recently said in an interview that he was being treated like a criminal by the Blues after Antonio Conte reportedly sent him a text that he would not be a part of the squad this year. Wenger insisted that there was no comparison between the two cases. “No comparison at all. We want Sanchez to be with us but I’m not sure whether Chelsea want Costa to be with them,” he said.

Wenger accepted that he was glad that Sanchez did not submit a transfer request like Philippe Coutinho. “It’s important you have a serene atmosphere inside and clarity about your commitment,” he said. “It’s important the players aren’t half in and half out and they are completely in.”

PM Modi govt making ‘unprecedented’ efforts to serve poor: Amit Shah,"The government also provided a “big relief” to crores of heart patients bringing prices of stents to one-fourth of the existing prices, Amit Shah said. (File photo) The government also provided a “big relief” to crores of heart patients bringing prices of stents to one-fourth of the existing prices, Amit Shah said. (File photo)

Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for capping of knee implant prices, BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday said the government was making “unprecedented” efforts to serve the poor and elderly in the country. Shah said the Modi government was converting the ancient concept of ‘Sarve Santu Niramaya’ (may all be free from illness) into a reality in the country.

The government had on Wednesday announced capping of prices of knee implants at a significantly lower rate than the current market costs, a move that could result in savings of Rs 1,500 crore annually to patients requiring surgery.

The decision came a day after the prime minister made the announcement of bringing down knee surgery prices in his Independence Day speech.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after taking reins in 2014, has taken several steps to bring down prices of some medicines and treatment of incurable diseases, and the poor have been greatly relieved,” Shah wrote in his blog.

“Reducing price of knee transplant is not the first instance of Modi government’s sensitivity. A few months after coming to power, Modi government had brought the ‘Jan Aushadhi Kendra’ scheme in January 2015, making available 500 important medicines at 50-95 percent less cost,” he said in his blog.

The government also provided a “big relief” to crores of heart patients bringing prices of stents to one-fourth of the existing prices, he said.

In an indirect attack on non-BJP governments, Shah said that Modi government has extended its limits beyond the cities and rich people.

“The parameter of success for the previous governments was GDP, economic growth rate and share indices and the needs of common man remained neglected.

“Modi government expanded its limits beyond the cities and rich and brought the under privileged in the mainstream through dozens of schemes like Ujjwala, Ujala and Swachh Bharat. Bringing down the prices of essential medicines, stents and knee transplant are efforts in the same direction,” the BJP chief added.

"For Metro rail, states must bring private players: Govt","The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC. The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC.

Marking a major shift in its approach to urban mass transit projects, the Union Government has made it mandatory for state governments seeking central financing for their proposed Metro Rail to involve private players in the execution and running of the system.

The Union Cabinet approved Wednesday the New Metro Rail policy, which states that “private participation either for complete provisioning of metro rail or for some unbundled components will form an essential requirement for all metro rail project proposals seeking central financial assistance”.

The Indian Express had reported in March on the proposed move to reduce the Centre’s role in funding metro projects through a push for privatisation.

The three broad PPP models detailed in the policy include constructing new Metro Rail systems through the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer mode, allowing private players to operate the service as well as supply rolling stock, and involving them in the maintenance and upgrade of infrastructure.

The new policy, however, was described as “the most disastrous and retrograde urban transport policy’’ by E Sreedharan, who had successfully headed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) since its inception and is currently a principal advisor to it.

Read | Nowhere in the world has PPP in Metro rail fully succeeded, says E Sreedharan

Speaking to The Indian Express (see interview, page 8), Sreedharan, who has consistently argued against the PPP model in Metro rail, said, “The policy seems to have been framed by someone sitting in the NITI Aayog with absolutely no experience of how metro rail is built and operated. As it is, in India, all 12 such projects put together, only 20-25 km of new metro rail is made operational every year. China is galloping way ahead at 300 km of metro rail being opened every year. We are already moving at a snail’s pace. Now with this policy, everything will come to a standstill.’’

India has, so far, steered clear of PPP in its metro rail projects due to the exigencies of keeping fares of public transport low. Moreover, the capital-intensive nature of such projects do not allow private firms to get a return on their investment unless they hike the fares steeply.

E Sreedharan E Sreedharan

Most of the metro rail projects so far have therefore been executed on the joint equity model with the costs being equally shared between the state and central governments.

The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC, followed by Mumbai Line-3, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Kochi. PPP, with Viability Gap Funding from the Union Government, has been tried out for Mumbai Metro Line-1 and Hyderabad metro rail both of which saw severe cost escalations and delays. In the Airport line of Delhi Metro, the private concessionaire abandoned the project mid-way forcing the DMRC to step in and take over operations.

D S Mishra, Secretary, Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, said the PPP would bring in private-sector efficiency and expertise in metro rail project. “This is part of the overall plans drawn up by the Ministry of Finance to have PPP not only in Metro but also in highways, water or sanitation sector.’’

The new policy also requires state governments to explore commercial exploitation of land along the rail project as also promote transit-oriented development, which will allow for densification of areas along the metro rail.

Currently, metro projects with a total length of 370 km are operational in the eight cities of Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi, Jaipur and Gurgaon. Metro projects with a total length of 537 km are in progress in 13 cities while projects with a total length of 595 km in 13 cities are at various stages of planning.

German politicians accuse President Trump of trivializing Nazi violence,"Republican leaders criticised Donald Trump for saying leftist counter-protesters were also to blame for violence last Saturday in Charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. (Source: AP) Republican leaders criticised Donald Trump for saying leftist counter-protesters were also to blame for violence last Saturday in Charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. (Source: AP)

Senior German politicians on Wednesday accused US President Donald Trump of trivializing violence by white supremacists in Virginia and called for a clear rejection of their ideology. Governments could only win the fight against hatred, racism and anti-Semitism by rejecting such ideology and the willingness to use violence, said Martin Schulz, the centre-left candidate for chancellor, adding that this applies to Germany and the United States.

“The trivialization of Nazi violence by the confused utterances of Donald Trump is highly dangerous,” said Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD).

“We should not tolerate the monstrosities coming out of the president’s mouth,” he told the RND newspaper group in an interview. Republican leaders criticised Trump for saying leftist counter-protesters were also to blame for violence last Saturday in Charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. His

comments won praise from white far-right groups.

Schulz is the main challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Sept 24 election. The SPD, junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition, trails Merkel’s conservatives in polls.

Schulz’s comments were echoed by Justice Minister Heiko Maas, another senior member of the SPD. “It is unbearable how Trump is now glossing over the violence of the right-wing hordes from Charlottesville,” Maas said in a statement, reflecting concern across the German political spectrum about the Trump presidency.

“No one should trivialise anti-Semitism and racism by neo-Nazis,” said Maas, senior member of the co-governing SPD.

Schulz and Maas are the highest-ranking German politicians to criticise Trump’s rhetoric about the violence.

The country has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled from 1933 until their defeat in 1945.

Merkel told broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action was required to combat right-wing extremism, noting that Germans had also seen a rise in anti-Semitism and had “quite a lot to do at home ourselves”.

Trump has come under increasing pressure over his stance on the violence, with many members of his own Republican party and US business executives distancing themselves from him.

Trump on Tuesday said his original reaction was based on facts he had at the time and said both sides were to blame. The violence erupted during a protest by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the American Civil War.

Protesters and counter-protesters clashed in scattered street brawls before a car ploughed into the rally’s opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people.

LG Anil Baijal approves pay hike for Delhi anganwadi workers,"Anil Baijal (File) Anil Baijal (File)

Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has approved the Delhi government’s proposal to double the honorarium of Anganwadi workers, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday. The move comes three weeks after the Delhi cabinet had decided to double the allowances of anganwadi workers and helpers in the national capital.

A cabinet decision was taken last month to raise the allowances for the workers and helpers to Rs 10,170 and Rs 5,089 respectively, Sisodia had said. The raise was awaiting Baijal’s approval. Earlier, the workers were being paid Rs 5,000 and Rs 2,500 respectively.

“The LG has given his nod to Delhi government’s decision to double the honorarium. Thank you. However, it took 26 days (to get the approval),” Sisodia wrote in a tweet. There are around 11,000 anganwadi centres in Delhi, and each centre has a worker and a helper, a government official said.

Confusion over transfer dealings underlies Chelsea’s woes,"The 3-2 loss to Burnley on Saturday, in a game where Chelsea ended with nine men on the field, was a disappointing start. (Source: Reuters) The 3-2 loss to Burnley on Saturday, in a game where Chelsea ended with nine men on the field, was a disappointing start. (Source: Reuters)

After a season in which they dominated the Premier League, winning the title by seven points, Chelsea are looking far from comfortable after just one game of the new campaign.

The 3-2 loss to Burnley on Saturday, in a game where Chelsea ended with nine men on the field, was a disappointing start. But the problems at the club go deeper than just one setback on the field.

Nor is the standoff with Brazilian-Spanish striker Diego Costa (nL5N1KX3ZC) the source of the malaise at Stamford Bridge. It does, however, point towards the possible source of Chelsea’s problems – the tension between the manager, Antonio Conte, and the club’s hierarchy.

Chelsea’s Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, remains, as always, silent in the background. But Conte has done little in his public statements to challenge the view that he is unhappy with the club’s transfer dealings.

The club has invested a combined 124 million pounds ($159.59 million) on Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, Antonio Rudiger from AS Roma and Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco, but Conte has been clear that he has a “small squad” for the double challenge of a title defence and a Champions League campaign.

Asked on the eve of the season why more new players have not been bought, he said: “Everyone is trying to do their job but, for sure, I think this question is good for the club – not for me.

“What do they tell me? We have to wait for the best moment, the best solution. We have to wait,” he said. The sale of midfielder Nemanja Matic to title rivals Manchester United appeared to many a strange decision. Whether the club or the manager wanted him to leave is a matter of dispute.

United manager Jose Mourinho – a former Chelsea manager – said on Sunday, after Matic’s excellent debut in a 4-0 win over West Ham, that he had not sought to unsettle his former player and that something happening at Chelsea opened the door for the move.

“It depends on what is happening, or what was happening behind doors,” Mourinho said. “I don’t know. “But I didn’t disturb him, I didn’t disturb Chelsea. I never thought it was possible unless something special was happening, and it looked like something was happening because his agent told me, ‘You can have him; you just have to pay’.”

Conte was widely reported to be disappointed that his club couldn’t sign Romelu Lukaku, who moved from Everton to United, and there are suggestions that the club is divided over what kind of player they should be targeting. But there are appears to be something of a “briefing war” now under way at the club.

A day after Costa gave an interview criticised the club, on Tuesday, The Times quoted unidentified “senior Chelsea sources” as saying Conte wanted only experienced players ready to do a short-term job, but the club was more interested in younger players.

Chelsea’s squad may still be too small, but that raises the question of why the club continues to off-load so many of their young players.

Nathan Ake went to Bournemouth and Nathaniel Chalobah to Watford. Liverpool signed Dominic Solanke. In addition, the Blues have, this off-season, loaned out Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Tammy Abraham, Kurt Zouma, Izzy Brown and Kasey Palmer.

The squad will be stretched even thinner for Sunday’s game at Wembley against Tottenham Hotspur. Captain and defender Gary Cahill and Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas were both sent off against Burnley and will be suspended for the London derby.

After a three-day break both teams will travel to Colombo for the final leg of the one-day international series. The fourth match will be played on August 30 while the final ODI will be held on September 3. The two teams will play a one-off T20 international on September 6 at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Two years ago, India traveled to Sri Lanka for the a three-match Test series. This was the first Test series in which Kohli was the captain but it did not start on a good note as India lost the first Test. But, the team made a comeback in the second and third Test to win both the games and series 2-1.

The current series will be important for India as this is the first assignment for new head coach Ravi Shastri and his support staff. He took charge of the team after Anil Kumble decided to step down owing to differences with captain Kohli."

Former Australian leg-spinner Stuart MacGill has turned down a Bangladesh offer to join the side ahead of two-Test series against his home country, a senior cricket official said on Thursday.

Bangladesh were hoping to get some inside knowledge from MacGill, who took 208 wickets in 44 Tests for Australia, before the crucial home series against Steven Smith’s team beginning later this month. MacGill was expected to join another Australian, Mark O’Neill, on the Bangladesh backroom staff for the tour by the world number four-ranked nation.

“You know that our president (Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan) already cleared it that Stuart MacGill was our first choice as spin bowling coach,” BCB chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury said.

“(But) for some of his personal reasons he cannot join the team at the moment,” Chowdhury told reporters at a press briefing in Dhaka.

“We will now go for our second or third option. We hope within a day or two we will be able to tell something about this,” he said.

Bangladesh have been without a spin bowling coach since the BCB sacked Sri Lankan Ruwan Kalpage, who failed to report for duty following a deadly Islamist extremist attack at a posh Dhaka cafe in July last year.

Bangladesh, who offered MacGill a short-term deal for three months, were looking to build on a year in which they recorded their maiden Test wins over England and Sri Lanka before reaching the Champions Trophy semi-final in June.

Australia are due to arrive in the Bangladeshi capital on Friday for their first Test series in the South Asian nation since 2006. The first Test against Australia is at Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium from August 27. The second starts in Chittagong on September 4.

Australia were to play two Tests in Bangladesh in October 2015 but the tour was cancelled after a wave of attacks by Islamist extremists in the Muslim-majority nation.

A 20-year-old militant of the banned Neo-JMB terror outfit responsible for carrying out Bangladesh’s worst terror attack was today killed after he detonated explosives in his hotel room to escape a police raid. The Neo-Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh militant, who has not been identified, killed himself right before a raid by police counter-terrorism unit and SWAT on a hotel in Dhaka’sPanthapath, Inspector General of Police Shahidul Hoque was quoted as saying by Dhaka Tribune.

The militant had planned to attack processions to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum on the National Mourning Day, police said. The police have also found leaflets containing militancy propaganda among the deceased’s belongings, the report said. The incident came as Bangladesh marked an annual national day of mourning to commemorate the assassination of the nation’s founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in a military coup in 1975. Rahman was Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s father.

The raid was part of an intensified crackdown on militants following the last year’s Dhaka cafe attack in which 22 people, mostly foreigners and an Indian girl, were killed.

"It is the fault of the management that Sri Lankan cricket is going through the worst period, says Arjuna Ranatunga","Former Srilankan Cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga criticized the Sri Lankan selection panel and went on to deem them as spineless. (Source: Express Photo) Former Srilankan Cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga criticized the Sri Lankan selection panel and went on to deem them as spineless. (Source: Express Photo)

Former Sri Lankan captain, Arjuna Ranatunga has come down hard on the Sri Lankan team management and slammed them for the dismal show in the recently concluded three match Test series. Ranatunga also went on to criticize the Sri Lankan selection panel and went on to deem them as spineless.

Addressing the media, the World Cup winning captain said, “”Sri Lanka cricket is going through the worst period. You can’t blame only the players, they are demoralised. It is the fault of the management.” and added, “We don’t have selectors with a backbone.” Ranatunga also raised calls for the sacking of Sri Lanka Cricket chief Thilanga Sumathipala.

Earlier, Ranatunga had spoken to the Hindu and said, “I was very disappointed after the last cricket elections. There are roles in this country, and I was not eligible to contest as the president. Cricket was like a religion to this nation and we don’t have that religion now. That is nothing to do with the cricketers. It’s all about wrong administration. I am a politician and a cricketer but I still lose because cricket in this country is a mafia run by a business group.

However, Sumathipala in a recent interview also came down hard on Ranatunga and said that if Ranatunga wants to criticise the government then he must first resign. “Every time the game is affected at the middle, Sri Lanka cricketers are not performing to the expectation, we hear this kind of noise coming from the same quarter,” Sumathipala said.

The same man (Ranatunga) is continuously making every effort undemocratically, unethically to hold an office of Sri Lanka Cricket, even when he has been democratically defeated more than once,” he added.

Lashkar commander killed in encounter,"J&K DGP SP Vaid said, “He (Ayub Lelhari) was one of the most wanted terrorists. It’s a great success for the forces.” (Express Photo By Shuaib Masoodi) J&K DGP SP Vaid said, “He (Ayub Lelhari) was one of the most wanted terrorists. It’s a great success for the forces.” (Express Photo By Shuaib Masoodi)

The Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) district commander of Pulwama was killed on Wednesday in an encounter with a joint team of the Army, police and paramilitary forces in south Kashmir. The joint team intercepted the car carrying Mohammad Ayub Lone, the Lashkar commander. Police officers said the militant, also known as Ayub Lelhari, fired at the forces and was killed after a brief encounter.

Jammu and Kashmir police chief S P Vaid hailed the force for shooting dead Ayub. “Ayub Lelhari, district commander of LeT, eliminated in Pulwama. Well done boys!” Vaid tweeted.

Police said they had information about Ayub’s movements. “We had… set up a barricade at Banderpora village,” Senior Superintendent of Police, Pulwama, Mohammad Aslam Choudhary told The Indian Express. “He was travelling in a Tavera cab. When intercepted, he fired at us. In the exchange of fire, he was killed,” the officer said.

Police said they had arrested the driver of the car but another person accompanying Ayub escaped. “We found an AK-47 rifle in his (Ayub’s) possession,” the officer said.

Police sources said Ayub was recently injured in an encounter with the police and paramilitary forces in Samboora village of Pulwama. They said a bullet hit him in the shoulder.

Ayub was a driver and an active over-ground worker (OGW) for militants before he joined the Lashkar two years ago. “He would drive a Sumo car and often ferry militants from one place to another,” said a police source. “When one of his associates surrendered before the police and exposed his role, Ayub had no option but to formally join the militants,” the source said.

"UK could continue EU peace funding for Northern Ireland after Brexit, Theresa May says","British Prime Minister Theresa May British Prime Minister Theresa May

Britain will consider replacing some European Union funding for peace projects in Northern Ireland after it leaves the bloc in 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday. The European Union has provided billions of euros of aid for the province since a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between Irish nationalists and British unionists in which 3,600 people died.

“We … want the EU funding that has helped victims of the troubles and cross-community groups to continue at least until the current programme finishes,” May said in an article in the Irish News newspaper. “We then want to go further, and explore a potential future programme of peace funding after we leave the EU,” May said. The British government had earlier committed to guaranteeing funding under the EU’s Peace initiative until the current round of funding ends in 2020.

"Not overconfident, will take one game at a time, says Jackichand Singh","Jackichand Singh said star player Sunil Chettri was passionate about playing for the nation and he gives off-field tips. (Source: File) Jackichand Singh said star player Sunil Chettri was passionate about playing for the nation and he gives off-field tips. (Source: File)

Indian football team winger Jackichand Singh on Thursday said that his side were not over confident and will take one game at a time in the Tri-Nation Series beginning here on Saturday.

India play against Mauritius on August 19 before taking on St Kitts and Nevis on August 24 in the tournament seen as a part of the preparation for the Asian AFC Cup qualifier game against Macau on September 5.

“We need to take a little pressure. We are becoming a better and consistent team day by day. We are not over confident but we are taking one match at a time,” Singh told reporters here ahead of the team’s training session here.

India coach Stephen Constantine has given young players chance whenever the team plays, and so Singh feels that players are competing with each other but not openly.

“Each player wants to keep their place in the starting XI. We do compete with each other, but we can’t do that openly. We know if we work hard and perform at training, we’ll be selected,” he added.

Asserting that the team was performing well, Singh gave the credit to the coach. “The team is performing well. What has changed it is because of the coach and trainers. The players work together all the time and I think that’s why we are becoming stronger. GPS has also helped us,” said the Manipuri player.

Singh said the coach has shown them videos of their opponents Mauritius and St Kitts and Nevis. “The coach has shown us some (videos) but not a lot. We go by what the coach tells us to do,” the India player added.

He said that younger players like Jerry (Lalrinzuala) and Udanta (Singh) were doing well and they ask seniors for tips, who told them how it’s different between playing for club and national team.

Singh also said star player Sunil Chettri was passionate about playing for the nation and he gives off-field tips. “The team combination is good and coaches, doctors and trainers are working hard so it’s good for the team,” he signed off.

"Paris: Car drove into patrons intentionally, at least 5 killed as car plows into French pizzeria: Officials","A BMW slammed into six soldiers as they left their barracks outside Paris for duty in what authorities said was a “deliberate” attack. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus, file) A BMW slammed into six soldiers as they left their barracks outside Paris for duty in what authorities said was a “deliberate” attack. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus, file)

French officials say the driver who steered into patrons of a pizza restaurant east of Paris clearly acted intentionally, but they have no reason so far to suspect a terrorist motive.

A judicial official said Monday night that the Paris prosecutor’s office, which oversees French terrorism investigations, was not involved in the case because there was no proof of terrorism at this stage.

A security official said there is no evidence of a political or Islamic extremist motive.

But both officials say authorities view the driver’s actions as intentional. They were not authorized to be publicly named.

An 8-year-old girl and at least five others were injured in the attack in Sept-Sorts, a town about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Paris.

Real Madrid’s confidence contrasts with Barcelona concern,"Barcelona finished three points behind Real Madrid last season. (Source: Reuters) Barcelona finished three points behind Real Madrid last season. (Source: Reuters)

Real Madrid have outclassed Manchester United and Barcelona to collect two trophies before the season has begun, and Zinedine Zidane’s side show little sign of relenting as they begin their title defence at Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.

Meanwhile, last year’s runners up Barca have been further shaken ahead of their opening game against Real Betis on Sunday by a knee injury to Luis Suarez that has ruled the Uruguayan striker out for four weeks. This piles more misery on the Catalans, who are still reeling from the departure of Neymar.

The two biggest sides in Spain are in contrasting frames of mind heading into the opening weekend, and not even Cristiano Ronaldo’s suspension from the first four Liga games for pushing a referee has dampened Real’s supreme confidence.

Instead, the Spanish and European champions appear less reliant on their Portuguese talisman heading into this season.

Ronaldo played only 24 of 180 minutes of Real’s resounding 5-1 aggregate win over Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. He was a late substitute in the European Super Cup triumph over United, yet Real produced a complete display characterised by their sturdy control in midfield and dominance of possession.

Their squad depth was underlined by the fact coach Zinedine Zidane was able to also leave out Gareth Bale and Isco in the second leg. Meanwhile, he watched Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez lead a three-pronged attack with Karim Benzema, with Toni Kroos and Croatian duo Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic giving their shaken Barca counterparts a lesson in passing.

The team’s versatility means Madrid are as comfortable in a 4-3-3 shape as they are a 4-4-2, and in the charismatic Zidane they have a coach the entire squad looks up to for his achievements with Real as a player.

The Frenchman has won seven trophies in little more than 18 months in charge of Real. Few in the team could be accused of lacking ambition ahead of the new campaign, in which they are hoping to become the first Spanish team to complete a sextuplet of gongs in a single campaign.

“Winning these two trophies against two great teams is not easy at all but behind these wins there is a hunger to keep winning,” Zidane said. “It’s great to start like this but now a very long season is about to start. It won’t be easy, but we’re prepared for the challenge.”

Barcelona finished three points behind Real last season but there is concern the gap between Spain’s biggest two sides could be far larger this season as the Catalans look shaken to the bone by the departure of Neymar to Paris St Germain.

Defender Gerard Pique is also a doubt for the game against Betis due to a thigh strain.

Coach Ernesto Valverde said he is looking to lift the team’s mood as the league campaign starts. “We need to recover our morale but we are still a good side. But we need to adapt because things have changed.”

ITC to invest Rs 1700 crore in Kapurthala food park,"The food park, for which the MoU was originally signed in 2013 will mark further expansion in the investments of ITC, which is already running three hotels, in the state.

The Punjab government on Wednesday said ITC Limited will invest Rs 1700 crore more in the integrated food park in Kapurthala. A government release said this was conveyed to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh by an ITC delegation, led by CEO Sanjiv Puri, at a meeting here on Wednesday. Puri informed the Chief Minister that the company planned to start commercial production from the plant, the biggest of its kind in the country, from October this year.

Besides atta, biscuits and snacks, the project would include manufacture of juices and dairy products.

“The ITC delegation further informed the Chief Minister that the company would be purchasing one million tons of wheat, along with one lakh tons of potatoes, every year from the state for the food park. The food park would generate around 5000 jobs for the people of Punjab,” said the release.

The food park, for which the MoU was originally signed in 2013 will mark further expansion in the investments of ITC, which is already running three hotels, in the state.

The initial investment planned in the project was Rs 680 crore, which was subsequently, in 2015, enhanced to Rs 1400 crore, which the company now plans to increase further to Rs 1700 crore, said the government communique.

Vietnam fires vice minister amid corruption crackdown,"Some former top officials of state-owned companies have been accused of corruption and could face years of imprisonment if convicted. Some former top officials of state-owned companies have been accused of corruption and could face years of imprisonment if convicted.

Vietnam fired a vice trade minister on Wednesday for wrongdoings at electricity firm Dien Quang Lamp, the government and state media said, amid a wider crackdown on corruption. Deputy trade minister Ho Thi Kim Thoa lost all her positions at the ministry after the Central Inspection Committee found her responsible, state media said. Public denouncements and dismissals of high-ranking officials are rare in the one-party state but have become more frequent since last year as the party moves to tackle corruption, especially at inefficient state-owned enterprises.

The inspection committee said Thoa violated rules on land, privatisation, share transfer and asset declaration. Thoa also approved the appointment of former PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corp chairman and ex-provincial leader Trinh Xuan Thanh, state media said.

Police said Thanh, suspected of corruption and causing around $150 million in losses at PetroVietnam (PVN), turned himself in after a 10-month international manhunt, but Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping him from Berlin.

Some former top officials of state-owned companies have been accused of corruption and could face years of imprisonment if convicted. Earlier this year, a top party official, who once headed PVN, was demoted and expelled from the powerful politburo.

US Vice President Mike Pence urges Latin American nations to isolate North Korea,"Vice President Mike Pence (Source: AP Photo/File) Vice President Mike Pence (Source: AP Photo/File)

US Vice President Mike Pence urged Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Mexico to break ties with North Korea on Wednesday, adding that “all options” are on the table with regards to the Asian state. “The US places great importance on the ongoing diplomatic isolation of the Kim regime and we strongly urge Chile today, and we urge Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties to North Korea,” Pence said during a visit to Chile in a joint news conference with Chile’s President Michelle Bachelet.

US President Donald Trump warned North Korea last week it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States, prompting North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the Pacific island of Guam. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.

The governments of countries Pence mentioned mostly said they did not have immediate plans to break off ties. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia. “Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,” a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.

Peru’s Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference the country had not been formally asked to break ties by the United States and would evaluate the issue at the right time. Lima, which has condemned North Korea’s missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.

The Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy. Trade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.

Brazil, the region’s largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports – mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather – and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.

Last year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.

Chile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence. “I’ve requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,” he said.

Pence said he would “especially welcome” Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world’s leading wine exporter outside of Europe.

Neighboring Argentina, Latin America’s No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. The leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.

Pence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation. “Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea’s provocations,” he said.

Pence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America “should do more” on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April. Trump’s comments last week that a “military option” was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.

“Chile will not support coups or military intervention,” said Bachelet at the news conference. “In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.” Pence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip “a little bit early” on Thursday after visiting Panama.

"With China wooing neighbour, PM Narendra Modi to visit Myanmar in September","Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: Reuters/File) Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: Reuters/File)

Less than three years after visiting Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw for the ASEAN summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to make his first bilateral visit to the country on September 6 and 7, sources told The Indian Express on Wednesday.

The visit will take place just after the BRICS summit in Xiamen, China, from September 3 to 5.

With China wooing Myanmar — the country’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has visited China twice, in August 2016 and April 2017, since coming to power — India is wary about the relationship between the two countries. India and Myanmar share a 1,600-km sensitive and porous land border, apart from a maritime boundary as well.

Officials said during Modi’s visit, the two sides are expected to renew their long-standing commitment not to allow insurgent groups to use their soil for hostile activities against the other side, which is essential for prosperity of people settled along the border.

Although this will be Modi’s first bilateral visit to Myanmar three years since he was sworn in, there have been several high-level visits in the iterim.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Nay Pyi Taw from August 8-11, 2014, to attend the 4th East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers Meeting and the 21st ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting. She paid a bilateral visit on August 11, 2014, and revisited in August 2016.

Modi went to Nay Pyi Taw from November 11-13, 2014 to attend the 12th ASEAN-India Summit and ninth East Asia Summit. He had called on Myanmar’s then-President U Thein Sein and met Suu Kyi. During that visit, the Prime Minister had also interacted with around 300 members of the Indian community in Myanmar.

Later, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval attended the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement ceremony on October 15, 2015, in which he was India’s witness signatory, among others that included China, Thailand, the EU, the UN and Japan. India’s presence was a demonstration of support to the peace process underway in Myanmar.

While no leader from Myanmar was invited for Modi’s oath-taking ceremony, Delhi has tried to reach out to the neighbouring country through a series of visits.

Suu Kyi, state counsellor in Myanmar government, visited India in October 2016 for the BIMSTEC summit in Goa, and met the entire top political leadership in Delhi during her four-day visit. Last year, the country’s new President, U Htin Kyaw, paid a state visit from August 27 to 30.

During the PM’s visit, New Delhi wants to display its commitment to the ties, especially since it describes Myanmar as the key pillar of India’s Act East policy.

President Bashar al-Assad’s march east compounds West’s Syria dilemma,"Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad. (Source:AP) Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad. (Source:AP)

Syria’s war has entered a new phase as President Bashar al-Assad extends his grip in areas being captured from Islamic State, using firepower freed by Russian-backed truces in western Syria. Backed by Russia and Iran, the government hopes to steal a march on U.S.-backed militias in the attack on Islamic State’s last major Syrian stronghold, the Deir al-Zor region that extends to the Iraqi border. Damascus hailed the capture of the town of al-Sukhna on Saturday as a big step in that direction.

The eastward march to Deir al-Zor, unthinkable two years ago when Assad seemed in danger, has underlined his ever more confident position and the dilemma facing Western governments that still want him to leave power in a negotiated transition.

The war for western Syria, long Assad’s priority, has shifted down several gears thanks to the ceasefires, including one organised by Moscow and Washington in the southwest.

But there is no sign of these truces leading to a revival of peace talks aimed at putting Syria back together through a negotiated deal that would satisfy Assad’s opponents and help resolve a refugee crisis of historic proportions.

Instead, Assad’s face has been printed on Syrian banknotes for the first time, and his quest for outright victory suggests he may retrain his guns on rebel pockets in the west once his goals in the east are accomplished. Attacks on the last rebel stronghold near Damascus have escalated this month. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to end CIA support to rebels further weakened the insurgency in western Syria, while also depriving Western policymakers of one of their few levers of pressure.

They can only watch as Iranian influence increases through a multitude of Shi’ite militias, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, that have been crucial to Assad’s gains and seem likely to remain in Syria for the foreseeable future, sealing Tehran’s ascendancy.

Assad’s opponents now hope his Russian allies will conclude he must be removed from power as the burden of stabilizing the country weighs and the West withholds reconstruction support.

With hundreds of thousands of people killed and militias controlling swathes of the country, Assad’s opponents say Syria can never be stable again with him in power.

“There is little doubt that the Russians would like a political solution to the war. The war is costly for them, and the longer it lasts, the less it will appear to be a success for Putin,” said Rolf Holmboe, Research Fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and former Danish Ambassador to Syria.

“But the Russians want a solution on their terms, which is one where Assad stays in power,” he said.

“The ceasefires do two things. They allow the Russians to take control of the political negotiations and look good internationally. But more importantly, they allow Assad and the Iranian-backed militias to free troops to grab the territory that Islamic State is about to lose.”

THE WAR FOR DEIR AL-ZOR

The eastwards advance has on occasion brought government forces and their Iranian-backed allies into conflict with the U.S. military and the forces it is backing in a separate campaign against Islamic State.

But the rival campaigns have mostly stayed out of each other’s way. Government forces have skirted the area where Kurdish-led militias supported by Washington are fighting Islamic State in Raqqa. The U.S.-led coalition has stressed it is not seeking war with Assad.

Bisected by the Euphrates River, Deir al-Zor and its oil resources are critical to the Syrian state. The province is entirely in the hands of IS except for a government stronghold in Deir al-Zor city and a nearby air base. It is also in the crosshairs of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). SDF spokesman Talal Silo told Reuters on Wednesday there would be an SDF campaign towards Deir al-Zor “in the near future”, though the SDF was still deciding whether it would be delayed until Raqqa was fully captured from Islamic State.

But questions remain over whether the government and its allies, or the U.S.-backed militias, have the required manpower. IS has rebased many of its fighters and leaders in Deir al-Zor. The Syrian army is drawing on the support of local tribal militias in its advances, local tribal figures say. A Western-backed Syrian rebel with detailed knowledge of the area said Deir al-Zor would be a tough prospect. “Deir al-Zor tribes are more intertwined with those of Iraq,” the rebel said, describing them as religious hardliners.

Andrew Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think-tank, said Assad hoped to regain international legitimacy through the campaign against IS.

“They believe that by doing so they can get reconstruction money, and they believe that things are going to go back to the way they were before. That’s just not going to happen,” he said.

There has been no sign that Western states are ready to rehabilitate Assad, accused by Washington of repeatedly using chemical weapons during the war, most recently in April. Syria denies using chemical weapons.

RULING “ATOP RUINS”

The April attack triggered a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian airbase. But the U.S. response was calibrated to avoid confrontation with Moscow, and has not resulted in further such action.

Trump’s decision to shut down the CIA programme of support meanwhile played to Assad’s advantage and came as a blow to the opposition. Rebel sources say the programme will be phased out towards the end of the year.

Damascus has been pressing ahead with its strategy for pacifying western Syria, pursuing local agreements with rebellious areas that have resulted in thousands of rebel fighters being sent to insurgent areas of the north.

But significant areas of western Syria remain in rebel hands, notably Idlib province in the northwest, a corner of the southwest, an area north of Homs, and the Eastern Ghouta of Damascus.

In the southwestern province of Deraa, one of the areas in the U.S.-Russian truce, the government is seeking investment in reconstruction, the provincial governor told al-Watan newspaper, saying the “shelling phase” was over.

Shunned by the West, the government hopes China will be a major player in the reconstruction. Seeking to project an image of recovery, Damascus this week will host a trade fair.

“The regime is quite keen to imply by signals that it doesn’t care, that ‘we are fine, we are really utterly prepared just to sit atop ruins, and to speak to friends who will help us with our project’,” said a Western diplomat.

Mohanad Hage Ali, director of communications at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said the Assads have been “masters of the waiting game”. Time is on their side, he said. “But they have two challenges: political normalisation with the world, and the economic challenge, which is significant.”

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field — who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US — is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

“Knowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,” Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

“The problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,” he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in “The Best American Short Stories” and “O. Henry Prize Collections”. Sharma’s first book, “An Obedient Father”, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, “Family Life” won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. “I began writing ‘We Didn’t Like Him’ the day after I handed in my novel ‘Family Life’. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

“I then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn’t satisfy me and so I wrote another,” the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story — from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

“We Didn’t Like Him”, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled “A Life of Adventure and Delight” (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. “They are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,” he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. “They cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,” he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

Murthal rape case: HC gives SIT a month’s deadline to conclude probe,"The site of the alleged rape in Murthal. (Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey) The site of the alleged rape in Murthal. (Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday gave the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing allegations of rape at Murthal near Sonipat during the 2016 Jat agitation, a one month deadline to conclude investigations.

The court also directed that IPS officer Amitabh Dhillon, presently IG, Hisar Range, will head another SIT to look into cases of alleged rioting, violence, arson etc, during the Jat reservation stir, other than the Murthal case. The court had earlier taken a suo motu cognizance of a media report regarding alleged rapes in Murthal during the quota stir.

When the matter related to Murthal came up for hearing before a division bench comprising Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan, the chief of the SIT probing the case, IG Mamta Singh, came under criticism from senior advocate Anupam Gupta, who is assisting the court as ‘amicus curiae’. “The head of the SIT has been submitting status reports from time to time. Seven to eight reports have already been given by her. As per her last report, no victim, no witness of the Murthal rape case has been found,” he said.

According to Gupta, he apprised the court that there was no new input in the SIT report even after one and half years of investigation. They have failed to find any victim, he said. “I said that I do not have any confidence in the head of the SIT and sought directions that the Murthal rape case issue be handed over to the CBI,” Gupta later said giving details of the day’s proceedings.

After hearing the arguments, the High Court bench decided to give a one-month deadline to the Mamta Singh headed SIT to conclude investigations, he added. The court also said that if after one month nothing substantial comes out from the SIT’s side, then it will examine whether to send the case to CBI, Gupta said.

According to the senior lawyer, the court had earlier said that another SIT must be constituted for the other cases that allegedly happened during the stir.

The Haryana home secretary had submitted ten names from which to choose the head of this SIT, Gupta said. “I had taken time to study those names. Today, I said that I have negative feedback about those names and instead proposed the name of IPS officer Dhillon. I told the court that he is competent, honest and has had a stint with the CBI,” Gupta said.

The court accepted my plea and Dhillon has been appointed as the head of this SIT, he added. “Dhillon will act independently, report to the High Court and probe all cases that happened in the violence during the stir other than the Murthal rape case,” Gupta said.

He said the court also heard five cases related to Haryana Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu’s family, including the burning down of their house in Rohtak in the violence during the Jat reservation stir last year. “The state government had suo motu sent these cases to the CBI. The High Court today asked the CBI to file a status report in these cases,” Gupta said.

He said the court will now hear the Murthal rape case and other cases connected with violence during the reservation agitation, on October 12

"Criticism is important for self-growth, says Mithali Raj","Mithali Raj has called for more television coverage of women’s sport. (Source: PTI) Mithali Raj has called for more television coverage of women’s sport. (Source: PTI)

After a commendable performance at ICC Women’s World Cup, Indian skipper Mithali Raj has admitted that to develop one self and increase their self-growth, criticism is important. This will only help to move women’s cricket forward, she added.

In an interview with the Hindustan Times, she said, “For self-growth, criticism is important and we have to remain consistent in our performance(s)

Women’s cricket grew in stature, but we lacked in getting a response from the audience and increasing fan following as we didn’t really do well in ICC tournaments. We know that World Cup is the only tournament we can look up (to) because that is the only stage where we can make a difference to the sport of India. We did it by showing our best performance

Recalling the period when she started playing, Mithali said, “When I started playing cricket in 1990, it was a wonder for people. People looked down on women’s cricket as they thought that women shouldn’t be seen as playing cricket,” and added, ” When we used to travel holding a cricket kit, people used to inquire about rules and also questioned on our capability by saying that women are not strong enough to hit a boundary. Sport is a sport. We continued our hard work,” she added.

Voicing support for more television coverage of the game, she concluded by saying, “More the tournaments of women’s cricket will be televised, more the sport will grow. It is (the) best time to start preparing to introduce Women’s IPL.”

"Marco Asensio is going to cause a real stir, says Zinedine Zidane","Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year. (Source: Reuters) Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona were given a painful reminder of what they missed out on by failing to sign Marco Asensio after the Spanish youngster’s long range strike set Real Madrid on their way to a 2-0 win over the Catalans on Wednesday to seal the Spanish Super Cup.

The Spain under-21 international had the Santiago Bernabeu crowd screaming with delight after his stunning goal in the fourth minute, adding to his 90th minute thunderbolt which had sealed a 3-1 win for Madrid in the first leg at the Nou Camp.

Karim Benzema added a second shortly before half-time to give Real a 5-1 aggregate win, which was richly deserved and led Barca defender Gerard Pique to declare he felt inferior to Real for the first time in 10 years.

Asensio’s contribution to Real’s dominance over the two legs was even more painful for Barca as they had let the former Mallorca forward slip from their grasp three years ago, according to the Spaniard’s agent Horacio Gaggioli.

Gaggioli said in an interview with website Bleacher Report that in the summer of 2014 Barca refused to pay the 4.5 million euros ($5.2 million) Mallorca were asking for Asensio up front, preferring to pay in two installments, leaving Madrid to snap him up later in the year for a reported 3.9 million euros.

Asensio spent the first year after his transfer on loan at Espanyol. But he has made the most of the chances given since returning to Real at the start of last season and on Sunday became the first player in the club’s history to score in five of his competition debuts.

Asensio has struck on his Liga, King’s Cup, Champions League, European Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup debuts for Real, also netting against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals and grabbing the final goal in Real’s 4-1 win over Juventus in the final.

Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year.

“When I saw his goal my jaw dropped,” said Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos, a teammate of Asensio with Spain’s under-21 side.

“What Marco keeps doing does not surprise me, I have known him for three years. He has the talent to keep doing what he’s doing in big games and against great teams.”

Coach Zinedine Zidane added: “Asensio is going to cause a real stir.”

"Gorakhpur hospital deaths: PIL in Allahabad High Court seeks probe by retired judge, CBI","Alleging negligence by government agencies, the petition, filed by social activists including Utpala Shukla of the PUCL among others, urges the court to facilitate an impartial and independent investigation by a retired High Court judge and the CBI.

(Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) asking for a retired judge to probe the deaths of over 60 children suffering from encephalitis in Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College and Hospital was submitted to the Allahabad High Court on Wednesday.

Social activists and lawyers made a mention of the PIL to the Chief Justice on Wednesday, after which it was decided by the court that the matter will be heard out of turn on Thursday. Several other similar PILs have been filed, slated to be heard later this month.

Alleging negligence by government agencies, the petition, filed by social activists including Utpala Shukla of the PUCL among others, urges the court to facilitate an impartial and independent investigation by a retired High Court judge and the CBI.

Making the state government and Centre parties to the case, the petitioners’ counsel K K Roy said, “We have raised the issue of the lack of proper investigation because the state government, which is currently investigating the case, has been denying a case of negligence. We are also raising the issue of lack of medical equipment and infrastructure at the BRD hospital, which has not been upgraded for years.”

The petition said, “More than 62 patients especially children died in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, and the reason told was due to the discontinuance of the oxygen supply.”

“The deaths of the children year to year are due to criminal neglect of the state government and health department, as most of the patients are children from rural and poor background,” it further stated.

The petitioners pegged the number of lives claimed by encephalitis at over a lakh since 1978, when it was first detected in Gorakhpur.

New Zealand’s Daniel Pearce takes one-shot lead in Fiji,"Daniel Pearce roared up the leaderboard with a scintillating start on his back nine to card a six-under 66 for a one-shot lead.

New Zealand’s Daniel Pearce roared up the leaderboard with a scintillating start on his back nine to card a six-under 66 for a one-shot lead after the first round of the Fiji International on Thursday.

Pearce, who started his round on the 10th hole, eagled the par-five first before making three birdies in succession at the seaside Natadola Bay Golf Course.

New Zealander Ben Campbell and Australia’s Daniel Valente both mounted late charges to finish one behind in joint second, with Malaysia’s Gavin Green a shot further adrift with a clutch of Australians at the European Tour event, which is co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia and Asian Tour.

Local favourite Vijay Singh was five back on one-under, the former world number one and triple major champion carrying an elbow injury through a typically windy day at Sigatoka.

“Before the round started if you told me I’d take one-under, I would because it was supposed to be pretty breezy,” Singh told reporters. “I was suspect to play. It’s really bugging me (when) I get to the top of my back-swing, so I had to shorten my back-swing to play,” he said of the elbow problem.

“But considering I was hurting that bad, I played OK.” Twice major champion Angel Cabrera faltered with three bogeys in his last five holes to finish with an even-par 72, along with fellow U.S. Masters winner Mike Weir.

The speech that did not pass the AIR test,"Tripura CM Manik Sarkar at the Independence Day parade in Agartala. (Source: PTI photo) Tripura CM Manik Sarkar at the Independence Day parade in Agartala. (Source: PTI photo)

On the occasion of Independence Day, I convey my greetings and best wishes to you all. I pay my homage to the great memory of the martyrs of India’s freedom struggle. I would also like to offer my personal regards to those freedom fighters who are amongst us today.

Independence Day is not just a ceremonial occasion. Keeping in view the historical significance and tremendous emotional attachment to this day for Indians, it has to be treated as an important ceremonial occasion for national introspection. Before us on this year’s Independence Day are quite a few very relevant, important and contemporary issues.

Unity in diversity is India’s traditional heritage. Great values of secularism have helped in keeping Indians together as a nation. But today, this spirit of secularism is under attack. Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religion country and in the name of protecting the cow. Because of all these, people of minority and Dalit communities are under severe attack. Their sense of security is being shattered. Their life is in peril. These unholy tendencies cannot be harboured or tolerated. These disruptive attempts are contrary to the goals, dreams and ideals of our freedom struggle. Related | Did tell Tripura CM Manik Sarkar to reshape his Independence Day speech, Prasar Bharati admits

The followers of those who were not associated with the Independence movement, rather sabotaged the freedom movement, were servile to the atrocious, plundering and merciless British, aligned with the anti-national forces, having decorated themselves today in different names and colours are striking at the root of unity and integrity of India. Every loyal and patriotic Indian must take the pledge today to remain committed to the ideal of a united India and counter the attempts towards such destructive conspiracies and attacks. We must all collectively strive to ensure the security of minorities and Dalits and preserve the unity and integrity of our country.

Today, the gulf between the haves and have-nots is widening. The nation’s vast resources and wealth are being concentrated in the hands of a few. A large majority of our people are suffering from poverty. These people are the victims of inhuman exploitation. They are being deprived of food, shelter, clothing, education, healthcare and security of job for assured income. Editorial | Censoring Manik Sarkar

This is contrary to the aims and objectives of our Independence struggle. Our current national policies are squarely responsible for this state of affairs. Such anti-people policies shall have to be reversed. But words alone will not achieve this. For this, we need the deprived and the suffering Indians to arise, become vocal and protest fearlessly, collectively. We definitely need an alternative policy that serves the interests of the vast majority of Indians. To bring this alternative policy into reality, the deprived and suffering Indians need to take a pledge on this Independence Day to launch an economic, political and social movement.

The mounting problem of unemployment has created a sense of despondency and gloom in our national psyche. On the one hand, lakhs of employed are loosing their jobs; on the other hand, crores of unemployed youth are waiting for jobs. It is not possible to solve this gigantic national problem without reversing the national economic policies which work to strengthen the very small group of profiteering corporates, and without increasing the purchasing power of the common people of India. Hence, the students, youth, and working classes will have to take pledge on this Independence Day to launch a collective and continuous movement to reverse these destructive policies.

In contrast to the anti-people policies of the government at the Centre, the state government of Tripura despite its limitations has been pursuing policies for the welfare of people in all walks of life with a special focus on the downtrodden and to advance forward with their cooperation. This is a totally different and an alternative path. This path has been able to not only attract the people of Tripura but also elicit a positive response of the downtrodden people of our country. This is not being tolerated by the reactionary forces here in Tripura.

Hence, conspiracies are being hatched up by the enemies of the people to disturb peace, fraternity and integrity of the state. And at the same time, attempts are on to disrupt the realm of developmental works. We need to counter all these unholy designs and isolate the reactionary forces. In this background, on this Independence Day, all the right-thinking, peace-loving and development-seeking people of Tripura need to take a determined pledge to come forward and work unitedly against such disruptive forces.

"Opposition’s talk of composite heritage but silence on killing of RSS workers is hypocrisy, says BJP","Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

The BJP on Thursday hit out at the Opposition saying it was “hypocrisy” to talk about composite heritage but remain silent over the killing of RSS workers in Kerala allegedly by CPI-M workers.

Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Congress vice president’s observations are more of a “political cry” arising out of a deep sense of dismay as to why he and his party are being rejected by the people of the country.

Earlier in the day, Rahul took part in the ‘Sanjhi Virasat Bachao’ (save country’s composite heritage) hosted by rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, where former prime minister Manmohan Singh and other senior Congress members as well as Left party leaders, including CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI national secretary D Raja took part in.

Rahul had also hit out at the government for not being able to keep its promises while targetting the RSS. “I have a question on the talk of composite heritage (‘sanjhi virasat’) which is going on today. RSS workers in Kerala’s Kannur are being allegedly killed by CPI-M workers, which heritage is that,” Prasad asked.

“The organisers of composite heritage – Congress, Left and Sharad Yadav are sitting together, how do they consider the merciless killing of RSS workers in Kannur in Kerala by CPI-M workers and their goons. Is it part of the composite heritage of India? This is hypocrisy,” he said. He claimed that those talking about composite heritage are a coalition of “failed people” and they will keep on failing in the future.

He said he was “intrigued” by Rahul’s remark that on the one hand, there are those who loot the country and on the other, there are those who give to the nation. “People have removed from power those who looted the country. Your party is also there. But today, one thing was clear by his comments. Rahul Gandhi does not give a speech, he cries,” Prasad said.

Taking a dig at Sharad Yadav, he said “The person whose entire politics started at the feet of JP, and opposing the Congress, is feeling happy today sitting beside Rahul Gandhi.” He said this is a coalition of people who are in fear of Narendra Modi and the BJP. This is also a coalition of those who have done corruption and now action is being taken, he added.

To a question, he said Rahul has silenced everybody in the Congress to such an extent that despite his party’s loss every time under him, nobody dares to ask him any question. On Kashmir, he said that the government is taking “very firm measures” against the terrorists and separatists and into their funding pattern. “That shall continue. But the larger commitment for Kashmir by the Prime Minister was outlined in his August 15 speech,” he said.

Prasad said that the most objectionable comment by Rahul today was that BJP is packing the judiciary and the media with its own people and will change the Constitution. “I would expect Rahul Gandhi not to make motivated political comment about the judiciary. India’s judiciary is independent and we all respect it. They are left with no issues and out of their political fear saying these things. I appeal to them not to not drag the judiciary.”

Prasad said Rahul’s grandmother had spoken about committed judiciary during the times of Emergency. “The political training of Rahul and the political heritage of Rajiv Gandhi have been very unclear as far as independence of judiciary is concerned. The talk of committed judiciary in the 70s when Emergency was there. I condemn these utterly irresponsible comments of Rahul concerning the judiciary and media. The Narendra Modi government fully respects the independence of judiciary and fully upholds the independence of media,” he added.

New Zealand PM calls on central bank to re-think mortgage lending restrictions,"New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English. (Source: Reuters Image) New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English. (Source: Reuters Image)

New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English this week signalled the central bank should consider removing mortgage lending restrictions as the country’s red-hot housing market cools. English, who’s National party faces an election next month, also ruled out adding further lending curbs based on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, a measure the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has long wanted to add to its toolkit. The comments came just before the central bank’s public consultation on the DTI rules closes on Friday. New Zealand house prices have been among the fastest-growing in the developed world in recent years.

The RBNZ – alarmed by the financial stability risk posed by the rapid rise in property values – tightened rules on loan-to-value (LVR) limits last year and house price inflation has since tapered off.

English said on Tuesday that he had highlighted to the central bank that the rules were meant to be temporary.

“If you bring something in as a temporary measure, then they should be clear about what’s involved in removing them,” English said on Tuesday afternoon, according to Fairfax media.

The Prime Minister added that the central bank was independent and he could not control its decisions, though he had raised the issue in meetings with them.

Economists and real estate agents have also suggested the RBNZ rethink its LVR limits after data showed home sales volumes plummeted by almost a quarter in July.

That month prices rose just over 3 percent on an annual basis, a sharp slowdown from the start of the year when the market raced ahead at a double-digit pace.

Nevertheless, the RBNZ, concerned that the moderation might be temporary, has asked the government for DTI limits to be added to its macroprudential arsenal.

“If there was a need for it then we’re open to it, but we don’t see the need at the moment,” said English, according to Fairfax, adding the government would not be looking at the issue before the election.

The comments are a rebuff to the central bank, which just last week reiterated it would like to have the new tools available in case house prices take off again.

The bank said it would consider the submissions received after its consultation process closes on Aug 18 and pointed out that international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund have also said the DTI tools should be available to insulate the banking sector from high-risk loans.

Indonesia to start one year countdown as Asian Games host,"Indonesia stepped in on the proviso it would be allowed to stage the games in 2018 and in two main host cities. (Source: File) Indonesia stepped in on the proviso it would be allowed to stage the games in 2018 and in two main host cities. (Source: File)

Indonesia starts a one-year countdown clock on Friday as it races to complete venues to host an Asian Games that it hopes will showcase the archipelago as a leading nation in the region and boost its perennially light medal total.

The Olympic Council of Asia originally selected Vietnam as host of the event, which is held every four years, for 2019. But the country’s Communist Party government pulled out in 2014 citing cost concerns.

Indonesia stepped in on the proviso it would be allowed to stage the games in 2018 and in two main host cities, leaving Jakarta and Palembang four years to get ready instead of six.

Problems immediately ensued because funds were scarce the government budget had already been set for 2015 and authorities in Jakarta and at a national level spent months working at cross purposes.

One year from the opening ceremony, organizers can point to substantial progress, but a sense of trepidation lingers. “In the end I’m only human,” said Erick Thohir, a businessman and part-owner of Italian football club Inter Milan, who is head of the 2018 Asian Games organizing committee. “Of course there is some pressure, some nervousness, but we have to be confident because this is a big event for our country.”

The games, expected to involve more than 9,000 athletes from 45 nations as well as 8,000 media and officials, will be split among several cities.

The main stadium is in the heart of the notoriously traffic-clogged capital Jakarta and the east of the city is home to a new velodrome and equestrian center. Palembang on the island of Sumatra, which staged the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, is the other main sports venue. Some sports, including football, will take place in West Java cities such as Bandung, Bekasi and Bogor.

The main stadium, which was used when Indonesia first hosted the Asian Games in 1962, is buzzing with construction workers. Among the renovations, its old wooden benches have been removed and replaced with modern seating in red and white _ the colors of the Indonesian flag _ to seat about 80,000.

The construction of the athletes’ village is almost finished and many major venues are more than 80 percent complete, and projected to be done by October.

But the velodrome and equestrian center, which are being totally rebuilt, aren’t expected to be completed until May of next year, leaving a tight window for rectifying any problems. Officials say five or six international-standard football stadiums are needed in West Java, but only two are up to scratch so far.

“We need to really be pushing hard” said Thohir, who met earlier this week with the provincial and central governments to accelerate the work. National pride is at stake.

“We’ve been waiting for this opportunity for decades,” said bank employee Trivandi Pohan as he ate lunch at a Jakarta mall. “This is an opportunity for us to show the world that we are a great nation.”

Indonesia is the world’s third-largest democracy and a member of the Group of 20 major industrialized and developing economies, but tends to perform below its weight in global affairs.

Successive governments have been mostly consumed by responding to frequent natural disasters, terrorism, communal conflicts and other crises in a country where corruption and poverty are still widespread.

“The government would like to make a positive point for the public that Indonesia as a big country should do better, like any other big country,” said organizing committee vice-president Gatot S. Dewa Broto, who is also a senior official at the youth and sports ministry.

There are also hopes that staging the games will boost Indonesia’s sporting prowess. The country of more than 260 million people won four gold medals at the 2014 Asian Games in South Korea, placing 17th in the medal standings, and is aiming for a top-10 performance next year.

The government is spending about 25 trillion rupiah ($1.8 billion) on games infrastructure. Organization and running of the games is expected to cost about 4.5 trillion rupiah ($330 million) with only a portion provided by the government and the majority to be funded by sponsorships and ticket sales.

With elections due in 2019 successful games would score political points for Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the ranks of the elite or military.

Jokowi has made an improvement to Indonesia’s creaky or non-existent infrastructure his top priority since being elected in 2014. A new international terminal at Jakarta’s main airport opened earlier this year and a traffic flyover near the main stadium was recently completed. However, subway and light-rail projects in the capital, where traveling five kilometers in peak hour can take two hours or more, are unlikely to be completed until 2019.

Thohir emits a rueful laugh when asked how athletes will cope with Jakarta’s daily “carmageddon” as they travel the 20 kilometer-plus (12-mile) distance between the village and the main venues a journey officials say should not take more than 45 minutes.

A police general has been seconded to the organizing committee and special lanes, athlete convoys and use of the city’s bus-only lanes are being discussed to reduce the slow travel times.

“I’m not an expert but I trust him,” Thohir said of the general. “He will find a solution.”

Flash floods triggered by incessant rains have left at least 27 people dead and nearly six lakh others marooned in nearly two dozen districts in Bangladesh, officials said on Monday. The unrelenting flow of water from upstream regions coupled with monsoon rains has flooded as many as 20 districts with the flooding spreading to other parts, officials said.

The Disaster Management Ministry said that 27 people have died in the floods as monsoon grasped 20 of the country’s 64 administrative districts.

The deluge has affected some 586,000 people, forcing 368,586 of them to take refuge in makeshift shelters as the country witnesses the second round of floods since June.

Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury said that government’s preparedness was underway to face a greater disaster in view of severe flooding in upstream countries like, China, India, Nepal and Bhutan.

“We have been carefully monitoring the situation in those countries (as) the water will naturally flow downstream to us,” he said. His comments came as expert feared the deluge to engulf vast part of the riverine nation in the coming weeks, causing a prolonged flooding.

The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) records suggest that water levels in three out of four river basins were rising simultaneously. If there are more rains at the end of August, at least 25 districts will be affected by floods, the FFWC predicted. The water levels will keep rising as India’s northeastern states will see “heavy to very heavy” rains, it said.

“We are taking all precautionary measures keeping the forecast in mind,” Department of Disaster Management Director General Reaz Ahmed said.

Around 60,000 families in Kurigram and at least 400 families in Nilphamari have been marooned. Railway officials said train services in several internal routes remain suspended for the past two days as water washed away soil and stones underneath the railway tracks.

Onrush of waters in the major Brahmaputra river and its tributaries coupled with heavy monsoon rains in the district submerged railway tracks forcing authorities to suspend train services in Dinajpur district.

“All indicators suggest that the flood is likely to be severe this time,” leading water expert Professor Ainun Nishat told PTI.

Nishat said gushing waters from three sides of the upstream region were heading towards central Bangladesh and feared that the unprotected eastern part Dhaka could be submerged for a prolonged period.

“The full moon phenomenon is to worsen the situation coinciding with the bursting water level but all we need to do is to protect in particular the flood protection embankments which are in place to evade damage as much as possible,” Nishat said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday ordered procurement of food grains from abroad to face any possible shortfall against the backdrop of impending deluge. Bangladesh witnessed a setback in crop production two months ago when a prolonged flash flood washed away standing crops in north-eastern region.

TV footages showed people were moving in boats in northern districts as swollen river waters inundated flood plains and submerged infrastructures. The FFWC officials said the water level in the Brahmaputra river, having its origin in China and entering Bangladesh from India, exceeded the records of past 100 years.

It said that continued and simultaneous rise of waters in the three major basins in the northeast, north and northwest regions posed the threat of major flooding in lower riparian Bangladesh criss-crossed by 230 rivers, 54 major ones being originated from upstream India.

The Teesta basin water level also surpassed the 98 years record and the rest of the three basins – the Ganges – this year saw the highest level of waters in the past 75 years. The Water Development Board said the level of water rose at 77 of its 90 observation points.

Bangladesh experienced the worst floods in decades in 1998 when 68 per cent areas of the country submerged. The flooding in 2007 was less severe than those of 1988 and 1998, affecting 40 per cent of the country.

Iran: Opposition leader under house arrest since 2011 hospitalised after hunger strike,"The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. (Representational image) The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. (Representational image)

Mehdi Karroubi, an elderly Iranian opposition leader under house arrest since 2011, was hospitalised on Thursday after starting a hunger strike to support his demand for a public trial, his official website reported. Opposition leaders Karroubi, Mirhossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard have been confined to their homes for six-and-a-half years after calling for rallies in solidarity with pro-democracy uprisings then shaking Arab countries.

They have never been put on trial or publicly charged. Both Karroubi, 80, and Mousavi, 75, suffer from ailments partly associated with their age. Karroubi has been hospitalised twice in recent weeks and underwent heart surgery. Karroubi’s son, Mohammad Taghi Karroubi, confirmed the Sahamnews website report on his Twitter account: “At 1 a.m. Thursday father was sent to hospital due to the hunger strike. Pray a lot”.

Sahamnews quoted the Shi’ite cleric’s wife, Fatemeh Karroubi, as saying that he would refuse “to eat or drink until his demands are met”. Karroubi and Mousavi ran in what became a disputed 2009 election that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power and triggered mass protests ultimately crushed by the elite Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij militia.

Dozens of political activists, lawmakers, journalists and artists have urged pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to fulfill his campaign promises of getting the opposition leaders freed, but he has been blocked by security and judiciary services that answer only to hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “He does not expect a fair trial but wants it to be public and would respect the verdict,” Karroubi’s wife told Sahamnews on Wednesday.

Karroubi, a former parliament speaker, has also asked for security forces to leave his house, which is under round-the-clock surveillance by the Revolutionary Guards. “He wants the security guards to leave the premises of his house,” Karroubi’s wife told Sahamnews on Wednesday. “Such a level of surveillance has never been seen before or after the (1979 Islamic) revolution … He wants the authorities to announce when they will hold a public trial.”

The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. “Karroubi’s life is in danger and the state, which has detained him without trial, is responsible for whatever happens to him while he is in its custody,” CHRI executive director Hadi Ghaemi said.

The reigning la liga and UEFA Champions League winners would like to start off the season with two trophies already in the bag having won the UEFA Super Cup after beating Manchester United in Macedonia.

In the first leg at Camp Nou, Barcelona were split wide open by a fluid Real Madrid midfield and despite Los Blancos going down to ten men late on, they held firm to avoid conceding but added to their advantage to make it 3-1. So Real Madrid will enter the second leg with three away goals to bolster their advantage and aid their chances of of winning the Super Cup for a ninth time.

Cristiano Ronaldo will be a notable absentee from the game after his 24-minute cameo in the first game. He came on to score a thundering drive, was booked twice to be sent off and to top it all off, pushed the referee after seeing red – which earned him a five game ban.

Where to live stream Real Madrid vs Barcelona?

With no TV broadcast of the contest between Real Madrid and Barcelona, there are no official legal live streams, either, for the game.

42-year-old man gets life term for killing daughter in Mumbai,"The witnesses told the court that while they were waiting for a colleague in the office pick-up car, they noticed a man with a child. They saw him trying to throw the child in front of the car. (Representational Image) The witnesses told the court that while they were waiting for a colleague in the office pick-up car, they noticed a man with a child. They saw him trying to throw the child in front of the car. (Representational Image)

A sessions court sentenced a 42-year old man to life imprisonment for murdering his five-year old daughter in 2015. Vipul Mehta had killed his daughter Tiya after her mother who had gone to work did not take his phone calls. Mehta had strangulated the girl and tried to project the death as an accident case by attempting to throw the child under a car. According to the prosecution led by prosecutor S D Gonsalves, Mehta was in a relationship with the victim’s mother for over nine years.

Tiya was their daughter. On March 11, 2015, Tiya’s mother left for her job at an orchestra bar in Malad around 8pm. Mehta went to drop her and returned home in some time.

According to the deposition of a domestic help, one of the main witnesses in the case, Mehta fed Tiya after reaching home. Around 3 am, he began calling up Tiya’s mother but she did not respond. He then told the help that he was taking Tiya to her mother’s workplace. He left the house with the child around 3.45 am and returned around 4.30 am with her on his shoulders. The help told the court that she had seen Tiya gasping for breath and she had tried taking her away from Mehta. But the man refused stating that the child was asleep.

According to the girl’s mother’s deposition in the court, when she returned home, she saw the domestic help trying to wake Tiya up. But the child did not respond. The woman also told the court that on the day of the incident, she was late in returning from work and had not answered Mehta’s calls since the phone was in the locker of the bar where she worked. She also told the court that Mehta was already married and he would be suspicious of her. The woman said she did not want to continue their relationship.

She told the court that there would be constant quarrels between them. Mehta would also beat up Tiya and hence, the woman said, she “strongly suspected” that he might have killed her daughter. Other witnesses in the case included employees of a company who were in a car near the colony gate where Mehta stayed. The witnesses told the court that while they were waiting for a colleague in the office pick-up car, they noticed a man with a child. They saw him trying to throw the child in front of the car.

They further said the child held on to him tightly and since the driver reversed the car, the man was not successful in throwing the child. The man subsequently ran away. The witnesses said suspecting that the child was in danger, they called up the police. When the mother and the domestic help were trying to wake Tiya up, the police reached the house and arrested Mehta. The police also claimed that Mehta had tried to consume an antiseptic liquid after the incident occurred.

Witnesses in the case also included a neighbour who had seen Mehta with Tiya below the building as well as another person who heard cries for help from the child’s mother who had screamed, “mere bacche ko maar diya” (my child has been killed). Mehta had claimed that he was not at the spot when the incident took place. The court convicted Mehta under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.

Zinedine Zidane ‘annoyed’ by Cristiano Ronaldo’s five match ban,"Zinedine Zidane was left annoyed after Cristiano Ronaldo’s four-match ban decision. (Source: AP) Zinedine Zidane was left annoyed after Cristiano Ronaldo’s four-match ban decision. (Source: AP)

Zinedine Zidane was left annoyed after Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo was given a five-match ban for pushing the referee during the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona on Sunday.

Ronaldo came as a substitute and scored in the 80th minute for Madrid, giving them one goal lead before Lionel Messi equalised for Barcelona with a penalty in the 77th minute.

“I am annoyed. We are very annoyed. I’m not going to have a go at the referees, but when you look and see what happened, to think Cristiano is not going to play five games … Something happened there, I’m annoyed,” Real Madrid coach Zidane said during a press conference on Tuesday.

He added: “What happened, happened, but when you look at what happened and see they have given him five games, it’s a lot.”

Ronaldo was already warned after getting a yellow card when he took off his shirt after scoring the goal. He was sent-off after getting a second yellow, moments later for diving. Following his red card, Ronaldo pushed the referee De Burgos Bengoetxea, which further ruined the situation. The Spanish football federation put a four match suspension for the four time Ballon’Or winner.

Madrid also appealed Ronaldo’s suspension and considering the appeal, the RFEF committee will take a decision on Wednesday morning, which means that Ronaldo could play in the second leg against Barcelona.

“We have to wait until tomorrow. The committee meets and after that meeting, we will see what we can do,” Zidane said.

On being asked if Zidane believed that ban was designed to single out Ronaldo, Zidane said, “I don’t know, I don’t think so and I hope not, I hope they did it with conscious and because they are doing their jobs, but well, in the end, what sticks with me is the five games.”

Madrid defender Dani Carvajal supported Ronaldo and claimed that the punishment was too harsh on his side. “It’s an excessive ban and a frustrating situation. I’m not in the referee’s head, but he didn’t have to be sent off,” said the Spaniard.

“We’re all upset with the punishment as Cristiano is an important player for us. We hope it’s reduced and he’s back in action soon.”, he concluded.

"Kareena-Karisma, Sonam-Arjun: Bollywood’s most stylish siblings","Be it attending red carpet events or simply letting their hair down, these Bollywood siblings do everything in style. From Kareena-Karisma to Malaika-Amrita and Jhanvi-Khushi from the younger generation, spotting these celebs in designer wears is a delight. Even though they commit fashion faux pas, at most times, these celebs manage to leave us spellbound with their superb sense of style. Lets' take a look at few of the most stylish siblings in Bollywood.

Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor: They are considered as one of the most stylish sister duo in Bollywood. Mostly, these two beauties manage to impress us but they are humans too, fashion faux pas is a part of learning.



At Saif Ali Khan's 47th birthday bash, Kareena Kapoor Khan's nude lips became a talking point. Now, it might have looked good on her in person but going by the photos, it didn’t impress us much. In fact, it just added age to her face and the bronze make-up didn’t help either, it simply looked like she suffered sunburns. However, her choice of outfit is commendable. We love the gorgeous peek-a-boo Self-Portrait top which she paired with simple black leggings.



Meanwhile, sister Karisma Kapoor impressed us in a military green shirt with embellished shoulders, black leggings and a hot pink pout and sister-in-law Soha Ali Khan made for a pretty picture with the baby bump in a blue gown with a side-slit and a metallic hair accessory.

At their father's 70th birthday party thrown by Kareena, both the sisters were seen wearing their favourite designer and friend, Manish Malhotra’s outfits. While Kareena picked a powder blue suit with gold embroidery on it, Karisma chose a beige outfit with beautiful white embroidery. Both of them paired it with metallic silver sandals. (Source: Instagram/Karisma Kapoor)

Kareena Kapoor Khan was seen at a party with her sister Karisma and husband Saif Ali Khan. This is from last year when she was heavily pregnant with Taimur Ali Khan. The actor looked gorgeous in a custom-made black gown with a plunging neckline by Gauri and Nainika. The gown with the lace bodice and sleeves accentuated her curves to perfection and she styled it well with jewellery from Jet Gems and hair in natural waves. Meanwhile, Karisma Kapoor looked all ready to party in the Robert Rodriguez number at Manish Malhotra's 50th birthday party. We love how she styled the black strapless ruched dress with gold sequin inserts with a pair of matching Louboutins, a black clutch and a sleek ponytail. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Malaika Arora and Amrita Arora: This sister duo is a source of inspiration for fashionistas out there. Three words come to our mind when we think of their wardrobe - chic, sharp and really smart. Undoubtedly, they have a great sense of style.

Sonam Kapoor and Harshvardhan Kapoor: Style runs in their family and every appearance of them is an inspiring one. While Sonam experiments a lot, Harshvardhan likes to stick to sharp, clean cuts.

We love Shraddha in this lovely cold-shoulder dress and Siddhanth in the classic combo. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Shweta Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan: While Abhishek Bachchan is not known for his sense of style, Shweta Nanda is! Be it Indian wear or western, we think she is really, really good.

Look at how lovely they look! We totally love Shweta Nanda's belted shirt-dress by Israeli designer, Dodo Bar Or and also, Abhishek's spruced-up look. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Suhana Khan and Aryan Khan: They are always in the news for being superstar Shah Rukh Khan's children. While a lot has been said about their sense of style, we think they don't really care about it as at most times these siblings are seen keeping it cool in basics. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

However, when they clean up, they do it in style. We love Suhana's tangerine Hervé Léger bandage dress and Aryan's super cool hairstyle. (Source: Varinder Chawla, Instagram)

Soha Ali Khan and Saif Ali Khan: There sense of style reflects royalty. We think it's really inspiring. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Need more proof? (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Sonam Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor: She is obviously hailed as the high priestess of fashion in India and no one can match up to her superb sense of style but Arjun Kapoor is not so bad himself.

UK iconic Big Ben to fall silent until 2021,"The restoration project that could take around four years would see major work on the clock mechanism, including repairs to the clock’s hands and its pendulum. (Source: File) The restoration project that could take around four years would see major work on the clock mechanism, including repairs to the clock’s hands and its pendulum. (Source: File)

The chimes of one of the world’s most famous clock towers of the 19th century, the Big Ben in London, will fall silent for essential repairs for four years from next week. The regular bongs of the Elizabeth Tower, as it is officially known, will sound for the final time at midday next Monday before being disconnected to allow the clock and surrounding tower to be restored.

The Great Bell has sounded on the hour for 157 years. It last fell silent in 2007 and before that, for major refurbishments between 1983 and 1985. Parliamentary authorities said stopping Big Ben – the commonly used name for the Palace of Westminster’s Elizabeth Tower – would protect workers carrying out the repairs.

However, it will still sound for important events including New Year’s Eve and Remembrance on Sunday. “This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home – the Elizabeth Tower,” said Steve Jaggs, the clock’s keeper.

The Big Ben, part of the Palace of Westminster Parliament complex in central London, traditionally strikes an E note every hour, and every 15 minutes four “quarter bells” chime.

To stop the chimes, the striking hammers of the bell will be locked until 2021. It weighs 13.7 tonnes. Elizabeth Tower is said to be the most photographed building in the UK.

The project’s principal architect Adam Watrobski told the BBC the works would install new amenities in the tower, including a lift, toilet and kitchen. The essential maintenance will also include making the structure more energy efficient.

Mohammed Shami shares family pic after Sri Lanka Test series win,"Mohammed Shami posted a picture of himself and his family from Sri Lanka. (Source: Twitter) Mohammed Shami posted a picture of himself and his family from Sri Lanka. (Source: Twitter)

Mohammed Shami posted a picture alongside his wife Hasin Jahan and daughter Aaira after the conclusion of India’s Test series against Sri Lanka where the visitors blanked and thumped the islanders 3-0. It is India’s first ever away Test series whitewash. Next up on India’s agenda is the ODI series and a soltary T20I and Shami took it as a chance to wish the team luck for the limited over matches. “Goodmorning everyone Travel time to India goodluck team india upcoming series,” he wrote in his tweet.

India will play five ODIs and single T20 against Sri Lanka with the series beginning on August 20. Shami has been rested for the matches including Umesh Yadav. The spinners, too, have been given some time off with R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja both allowed to unwind after playing a long domestic Test season followed by the IPL, ICC Champions Trophy, tour of West Indies and Sri Lanka.

Shami played a key role in the third Test against Sri Lanka which India won by an innings and 171 runs. The seamer got the ball to move around beautifully to peg the host batsmen back from the word go and it allowed the other bowlers to run through the pack with Kuldeep Yadav picking up four wickets.

Goodmorning everyone Travel time to India goodluck team india upcoming series 🖒🖒 pic.twitter.com/xuLa47xTIl — Mohammed Shami (@MdShami11) 16 August 2017

Skipper Virat Kohli extended his support towards Shami and applauded the bowler by calling him as one of the three best bowlers in the world. “I certainly rate Shami among the world’s top three fast bowlers for sure. Because of his wicket-taking ability and the kind of impact he has on games. When he makes up his mind to come out and give it his 120 percent, then he can bowl like this – 145, 140 clicks on a regular basis and troubling the batsmen.”

“It is not just reckless bowling. So he is a quality bowler. He has all the ingredients of becoming a consistent world-class bowler, provided the fitness factor can be maintained and hopefully he is not hampered with any more injuries.”

““He is a very valuable bowler for us and when he is on song, it’s delightful to watch. We all really enjoy standing on the field and watching him bowl like that. He is very special,” Kohli added.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

Country-wide assessment of learning outcomes on November 13: HRD Ministry,"HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar(Express photo) HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar(Express photo)

The union government will conduct its first country-wide assessment of learning achievements on November 13 in which over 30 lakh school students of Classes III, V and VIII in 35,000 government schools will participate. This will be the world’s largest sample survey of learning outcomes, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a meeting with state governments on Wednesday.

Learning outcomes are assessment standards which help teachers to understand the learning levels of students in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Earlier this year, the union government amended Rule 23(2) under the Right to Education (RTE) Act making it compulsory for all state governments to codify expected levels of learning which students in Classes I to VIII should achieve in different subjects.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has drafted learning indicators for eight subjects — English, Hindi, Urdu, Mathematics, EVS (Environmental Science), Science and Social Sciences — based on which states can finalise their own indicators.

For instance, as per the NCERT document, learning indicators in writing for a Class I student will assess not just the student’s ability to recognise letters A to Z, but also his/her ability to carry out simple instructions such as ‘shut the door’, ‘bring me the book’. In Class II, a student should be able to compose and write simple, short sentences with space between words. The levels gradually increase so that by Class VIII, a student cannot only read and write, but also use his or her faculties to read between the lines, understand new concepts and explore and read other areas of knowledge.

The learning outcome test on November 13 is being conducted to implement the amendment of Rule 23 (2) of the RTE Act. The National Achievement Survey or NAS, which is being held since 2001, has been tweaked by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to now test a student’s competency instead of her knowledge of the school curriculum. Also, earlier only 4.5 lakh students across Classes III, V and VIII were being assessed through NAS. Starting this year, 30 lakh government school kids will be tested.

“NAS will now produce district-wise comparison within each state as opposed to the state-to-state comparison that it is doing since 2001. The learning outcome test will be administered in 19 languages and the government will propose short, mid-term and long-term interventions including policy changes to the state governments based on the results of this assessment,” NCERT chairman Hrushikesh Senapaty told The Indian Express.

On Wednesday, Javadekar held a meeting with all state government representatives via video conference to brief them about the learning outcome test in November. It will be a pen-and-paper test in which students will have to attempt multiple-choice questions. Students will have to fill in their choices on an OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheet which can be scanned for quick processing of results.

Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: This Akshay Kumar film is derailed by clunky execution,"Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: The movie wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay Kumar) and the sprightly Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar). Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: The movie wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay Kumar) and the sprightly Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar).

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha star cast: Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Divyendu Sharma, Sudhir Pandey, Anupam Kher

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha director: Shree Narayan Singh

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha rating: 2 stars

The noblest ideas are very often derailed by clunky execution. This is the problem with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, which had the potential to become a deep, dark satirical take on one of the biggest problems that still shamefully plagues India: defecation in the open.

The film which has to contend with a clunky title in the first place, wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay) and the sprightly Jaya (Pednekar), which derails as soon as the latter turns into a ‘nai-naveli dulhan’ and discovers that she has to be part of a ‘lota party’ at the crack of dawn to complete her ablutions.

If the conflict had stayed personal, this could have been something to watch. Because both Akshay who admits to looking his age, and Pednekar who steps into her second film pretty much like she did in her first (the wonderful Dum Laga Ke Haisha), spark well together. And the reason for the conflict, a basic human need, should have taken us down a new path in mainstream Bollywood cinema. If only the treatment hadn’t been so heavy handed, and bent upon underlining the obvious.

But the film is after something larger. It is after society. It is after culture. It is so busy pointing fingers at the Indians, good people but blinded by tradition of ‘jis aangan mein tulsi hai, usi mein shauchalaya kaise ban sakta hai’, who will still go out into the open, that it forgets that polemics make good academic papers. They do not necessarily make good films.

A still from Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. A still from Toilet: Ek Prem Katha.

It’s fitting that Akshay Kumar has greenlit and played the lead in this film, which is more a primer on How To Break Social Taboos and Make Toilets rather than a powerful social drama. The moment a film succumbs to being the carrier of a Message as opposed to a message, it becomes burdened.

Akshay has been playing the nationalist hero in his last few films, filling in the space that Manoj Kumar had left vacant. And he’s done a good job with it: there’s something in the way he comes at being earnest that you want to believe.

Here too, he tries hard to get past the heavy-handedness and the clunkiness and the leaded messaging which engulfs the second half, when you have to go looking for the movie from under the message. And you have to look for a long time, because the film feels so stretched: a `lath-maar’ Holi sequence is bunged in, because a) it’s Mathura and b) well, because it’s a song-and-dance.

This kind of film, where the s**t literally hits the fan, where you can see real turd droppings, and the dialogue is filled with such ‘sanskaari-sarkaari’ words like ‘soch’, ‘shauchalaya’ and ‘sandaas’, needs a light touch. You need the ‘khadi boli’ of Mathura, where the film is set, spoken with a great deal more authenticity. And above all, if you are going to give me a feisty heroine who is happy to throw off her ‘ghoonghat’, and rail against patriarchy, you should not make her touch anyone’s feet. If you are making a film that hoists a flag for a strong feminist ideal, then don’t waver, and confuse it with stuffing the film with too many issues.

Otherwise, you dilute and confuse things, especially because your lead actors have stayed the smelly course.

"Maharshtra farmers’ stir fizzles out, members to meet again to chart next step","The agitation was restarted as farmers feel their initial demand of a complete loan waiver has not been met.

(Representational Image) The agitation was restarted as farmers feel their initial demand of a complete loan waiver has not been met.

The second phase of the farmers agitation, seeking a complete loan waiver appears to have fizzled out with the state unwilling to pay heed to the agitating farmers. The leaders of the agitation have now said that they will meet to draft a strategy for their future course of action.

“There were no agitations today. The ball is now in the court of the state government. In democracy we can agitate to put forth our grievance. However, a government also needs to engage with people who have problems. This government feels that it is in a comfortable position and has so far not held any kind of discussion with us,” Dr Ajit Nawle, convener of the coordination committee of the agitating farmers, said.

Over the past two days, the agitation managed to gain some traction in rural Maharashtra as farmers came out on the streets seeking a complete loan waiver. On Monday they had held a “Chakka Jam” to stop the movement of vehicles on state and national highways. Hundreds of farmers were detained in various parts of the state while taking part in the agitation.

On Wednesday, farmers had also held protests to stop ministers from unfurling flags in various parts of the state. Nawle claimed that the coordination committee will now meet on a yet undecided date to chart its future course of action. “We are not happy with the way farmers have been treated. We will continue with our protests. The modalities of how we will do it will be worked when the coordination committee meets next. The date of the meeting is yet to be decided,” Nawle said.

He said the leaders were considering picketing of the CM’s residence in Mumbai. “There is a popular demand that we should picket the CM’s residence. However, we will take a formal decision when we meet,” Nawle said. Farmers in Maharashtra resumed their agitation, 62 days after they called off their initial 11-day strike seeking a loan waiver and fundamental changes in the functioning of agricultural markets.

The agitation was restarted as farmers feel their initial demand of a complete loan waiver has not been met. The agitating group has also questioned the utility and impact of the Maharashtra government’s loan waiver saying that it has not helped all farmers in the state.

The initial farmers agitation which had forced the state government to come out with a loan waiver scheme had been limited to Western Maharashtra and North Maharashtra.

To placate farmers, the chief minister had declared that the government’s farm loan waiver scheme would benefit 89 lakh farmers in the state which would cost Rs 34,022-crore to the exchequer. The government had limited its waiver to Rs 1.5 lakh per farmer, which is being opposed by farmers. The agitating group is also seeking higher Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agriculture produce.

Real Madrid starts title defense way ahead of Barcelona,"Real Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna. (Source: Reuters) Real Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna. (Source: Reuters)

It’s been a long, long time since Real Madrid felt this good going into the Spanish league season. Madrid displaced Barcelona as the top team in Spain last season by winning the title for the first time in five years. It also successfully defended its Champions League title to complete its first league-European Cup double since 1958.

Add to that this week’s win over a Barcelona team that has been hard hit by the exit of Brazil striker Neymar, and Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna.

Madrid dominated Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate to win the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday, only eight days after dispensing with Manchester United 2-1 in the European Super Cup.

Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, however, is trying to keep his players focused on the long haul toward next spring. “There won’t be any euphoria because we know this will be long,” Zidane said after Madrid’s 2-0 win over Barcelona in the second leg. “This team is hungry and we will try to keep this going. We know that it will not be easy, but we are prepared to accept the challenge.”

Easily lost in the glitter from all the trophies is Zidane’s achievement of crafting a squad that is dangerous no matter who plays. That depth was on full display in the curtain-raising super cups, when Madrid outclassed its rival powerhouses with very little help from Cristiano Ronaldo.

Still regaining his peak fitness, Ronaldo was a second-half substitute against United and in the first leg against Barcelona, when he scored a goal before being sent off.

Marco Asensio, a 21-year-old forward, is also one to watch after his goals from distance against Barcelona. Midfielders Francisco “Isco” Alarcon and Casemiro excelled against United with each scoring, and Madrid has signed young reinforcements Theo Hernandez, Dani Ceballos and Jesus Vallejo to cover the exits of Alvaro Morata, James Rodriguez, and Pepe.

The emergence of Asensio and Isco has even put into question the role of Gareth Bale, who didn’t play Wednesday. “I have a spectacular squad. You don’t notice the changes (to the starting 11),” Zidane said. “We can swap three or four players (in the lineup) and the team doesn’t change. I won’t say we play better, but we still play well, so we are satisfied.”

The extra options will serve Madrid well as it starts the league without Ronaldo, who is suspended for four matches after pushing the referee following his sending off at Camp Nou. As Madrid has gotten stronger, its challengers have gotten weaker.

Barcelona has been severely hampered by the exit of Neymar, who left for Paris Saint-Germain after its Qatari owners paid the record sum of 222 million euros ($262 million) to trigger his release clause.

That has left Lionel Messi without his favorite partner, and the club is struggling to spend its extra cash on players who can shore up a squad that is clearly a step or two behind Madrid. So far, the only post-Neymar signing is Paulinho, a midfielder.

“We have to bounce back soon because the league is starting,” Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said, looking ahead to Sunday’s home match against Real Betis. “We have to focus on the league ahead and keep going forward because that’s all we have.”

Atletico Madrid, which has finished third for three straight years since winning the title in 2014, can’t sign new players until January because it broke FIFA rules regarding youth players.

So the club coached by Diego Simeone is a retread of the one that relied on 33-year-old Fernando Torres and an uninspiring Kevin Gameiro to help Antoine Griezmann get goals.

Besides a new coach in Eduardo Berizzo, Sevilla is facing life after the departure of Ramon “Monchi” Rodriguez, its longtime sports director who took his talent-hunting skills to AS Roma. Forwards Manuel “Nolito” Agudo and homegrown fan favorite Jesus Navas have arrived from Manchester City, but Spain forward Victor “Vitolo” Machin will play at Las Palmas before he joins Atletico in 2018.

Villarreal could be a team to watch. Carlos Bacca has come on loan from AC Milan to replace Roberto Soldado as the team looks to break into the top-four spots and the Champions League berths.

Captain Amarinder Singh writes to Centre to ease Pathankot rail congestion,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh

Coming to the aide of Pathankot residents, who have been complaining about nine railway crossings in the city, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has written to Union Railways Minister seeking permission for utilisation and development of the existing local Dalhousie Road Railway Station for arrival and backward departure of trains.

In a letter to the Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Amarinder urged him to accede to his request in order to tackle the congestion at Pathankot, and also to minimise pollution that was adversely affecting the health of local residents, said a government release. Pointing out that ROBs and RUBs were not feasible on this line due to narrow land availability, the Chief Minister sought the railways minister’s personal intervention to allow the state to use the Dalhousie railway station in public interest.

It may be noted that the narrow gauge railway track from Pathankot to Joginder Nagar was inaugurated in 1929, and takes off from the main railway station at Pathankot. With the passage of time, the city has expanded on either side of the track and become densely populated, leading to heavy congestion along the railway track.

Besides, there are nine railway crossings on the railway line passing midway through the city and these remain closed during peak hours, resulting in heavy losses to business establishments, while also causing all sorts of pollution, the spokesperson pointed out.

A young batsman in Pakistan lost his life after being struck with a ball during a club match in Mardan, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In the tragic incident, young Zubair Ahmed was hit on the head by a bouncer with reports claiming he wasn’t wearing a helmet at the time. He was part of the Fakhar Zaman academy.

As per reports, he received attention at the ground but died there itself. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made it clear that the incident did take place and stressed on the need of wearing helmets while playing. “Tragic death of Zubair Ahmed is another reminder that safety gear i.e. helmet must be worn at all times. Our sympathies with Zubair’s family,” said a tweet by PCB.

Former Australia cricket Dean Jones who is currently involved in Pakistan cricket as head coach of the Islamabad United in PSL also expressed condolences in his message.

This isn’t the first time a cricketer has died after being struck by a ball. Entire cricketing universe was sent into deep mourning when Philip Hughes was hit by a bouncer in November, 2014 during a Sheffield Shield match at Sydney Cricket Ground. He was hit on the neck at the time and taken to the hospital where he passed away two days later. During this period, Hughes never regained consciousness.

"Karma Sutra: Seasons change, and so do life’s phases","Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Seasons change; the old leaves shed and the new ones crop up; winter gives way to spring and spring to summer and just when the scorching sun is beyond our endurance, the dark clouds rumble along and we survive these ever-changing, never stagnant seasons.

And so it is with our life. The phases of our life can easily be classified into favourable or unfavourable. The nature of our problems and the source of our unhappiness or contentment may vary but what remains constant is its cyclical nature. And yet, when we are passing through a phase, favourable or unfavourable, we assume it to be permanent. This causes us to lapse into either despair or complacency.

Our despair leads to frustration and anxiety while our complacency leads to arrogance and excesses. And one fine day, just like that, things begin to change; darkness gives way to dawn and dawn moves towards dusk. This visibility of light at the end of the tunnel helps us cover the rest of the ground in hope. It brings with it immense relief and gives is the strength to carry on.

As for those who are moving towards the dark tunnel and find themselves in a no man’s land, the change brings with it unrest and a shaking up of the very foundation on which our life runs. Since these phases are cyclical in nature and only the nature of our problems differs each time, we need to know as a rule of life that no phase lasts forever. Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change.

The Chinese illustrate this idea through their “Diagrams of the Supreme Ultimate”, which is also the grand leitmotiv of the Chinese culture. The diagram is a symmetric arrangement of dark (yin) and bright (yang). It is not static but rotational and shows the cyclical movement of the two forces of nature. The two dots in the diagram symbolise the idea that each time one of the two forces reaches its extreme it is bound to turn around and become its opposite.

(Source: hermetica.com) (Source: hermetica.com)

This belief has given them the courage and perseverance to ride out their unfavourable phase and made them cautious and modest during their favourable one.

The Taoist sage, however, believes that knowing the impermanence of the favourable and unfavourable one should not resist the flow but adapt one’s actions to it and strive to maintain a sense of equanimity through both.

"200 accounts ‘locked’: In Delhi’s first WannaCry attack, publishing firm hit","When the IT staff at the publishing company tried to diagnose the problem, they found that they had been at the receiving end of a ransomware attack. (Representational image) When the IT staff at the publishing company tried to diagnose the problem, they found that they had been at the receiving end of a ransomware attack. (Representational image)

After the WannaCry ransomware cyber attack spread like wildfire and paralysed computer systems across the world, isolated incidents were reported from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala and West Bengal. Now, the capital has seen its first ransomware cyber attack, with employees of Rachna Sagar Private Limited “locked” out of more than 200 computers.

The cyber attack was reported on August 9 when staff at the publishing company found that they could not log into their user accounts, and could only use the “demo” account. The WannaCry malware attack exploits potential vulnerabilities of computer systems as hackers encrypt all files and demand ransom in exchange for unlocking them. Last year, a ransomware attack was used to target the Mumbai police system, and several files were encrypted by hackers.

When the IT staff at the publishing company tried to diagnose the problem, they found that they had been at the receiving end of a ransomware attack. The hackers had posted a message demanding a ransom between 800-1000 US dollars in Bitcoin. While diagnostic work at the publishing company is underway, the encrypted data has not been recovered. DCP (central) M S Randhawa confirmed the cyber attack and said a complaint has been registered at Darya Ganj police station. The complaint was filed by the general manager at the company. “This morning, when we started our work and opened Busy software, we received a text message which said our files are encrypted. The message said we have to pay money to enable decryption of our files (sic),” the complaint read.

The publishing company uses the accounting software called “Busy” for its work. Employees have two accounts that they log into for accounting transactions — live and demo mode. Users have to gain access to the live mode to conduct business, which they have been locked out of by the hackers. Police sources said it is difficult to track the hackers as they hacked into the computer systems using a proxy network.

“The hackers have locked out their data since April. Employees have not been able to conduct any business since the day of the cyber attack. Their billing process has been delayed and they are even scared to use netbanking as they fear online payment systems may be compromised,” said a source privy to the investigation.

"J&K: Congress slams RSS, BJP over Article 35 A case","Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Thursday accused the RSS and the BJP of trying to abrogate the special of the state because of their “vested interests” and said it will resist tooth and nail any such attempts. Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Thursday accused the RSS and the BJP of trying to abrogate the special of the state because of their “vested interests” and said it will resist tooth and nail any such attempts.

The Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Thursday accused the RSS and the BJP of trying to abrogate the special of the state because of their “vested interests” and said it will resist tooth and nail any such attempts. “RSS-BJP is desperate enough to erode the constitutional authority of the state to serve their vested interests. Any attempt to weaken special status will be defeated tooth and nail,” Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief G A Mir said at a party convention in north Kashmir.

He alleged that a “malicious campaign” has been launched against the special status of the state, especially the Article 35 A, calling it a move to change the demography of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 35 A of the Indian Constitution grants special provisions to residents of Jammu and Kashmir.

Mir pledged to continue to fight against “wrong, anti-people policies of the PDP-BJP government” in the state. He briefed the party cadres about the fallout of fiddling with Article 35A, saying it is the main component of the special status and “any attempt to weaken it will be a dangerous proposition fraught with serious consequences”.

Mir accused the ruling PDP of being “fully responsible” for the current fiasco and said it cannot escape the “responsibility” for “death and destruction in the (Kashmir) Valley”.

Alleging that the PDP had crossed all limits of mis-governance, Mir said “(Chief Minister) Mehbooba is adopting dictatorial attitude of (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi, who is in a habit of suppressing the voices being raised against his wrong policies and was out to crush the genuine voice of the people.”

The Congress leader said that people have realised that they have been “betrayed” by the PDP for electoral gains. “The PDP secured votes to checkmate the BJP (in 2014 assembly elections) but aligned with the same party for the sake of power and not caring about the urges of people (of the state)”.

Scientists potentially narrow MH370 search area to 3 spots,"Malaysia, China and Australia agreed to suspend the deep-sea sonar search in January after 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of seabed were combed without finding any trace of Flight 370 (Source: Reuters/File) Malaysia, China and Australia agreed to suspend the deep-sea sonar search in January after 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of seabed were combed without finding any trace of Flight 370 (Source: Reuters/File)

Scientists have potentially narrowed the search area for the missing Malaysian airliner to three specific locations in the southern Indian Ocean, through new satellite and drift analysis of the 2014 crash released Wednesday. But the Australian Transport Safety Bureau cautioned that the drift analysis by Australian science agency CSIRO is based on French satellite images of “probably man-made” floating objects without evidence that they were from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

But the locations could provide potential starting points to search within a 25,000-square-kilometer (9,700-square-mile) expanse identified by a panel of experts in November as the most likely resting place of the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board.

That expanse adjoins the original search zone far southwest of Australia that was identified through satellite analysis of the final hours of the flight that apparently ended when the plane ran out of fuel. Malaysia, China and Australia agreed to suspend the deep-sea sonar search in January after 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of seabed were combed without finding any trace of Flight 370.

The new analysis is based on French military satellite images gathered on March 23, 2014 _ two weeks after Flight 370 mysteriously veered far off course during a flight by Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing and were taken near the original underwater search zone.

The Australian bureau took over the search for Flight 370 from Malaysia a week later. Satellite experts at Geoscience Australia were not asked to analyze the images until March this year. The experts concluded that a dozen objects appeared to be man-made.

The CSIRO then investigated where the objects might have originated before drifting for two weeks. The CSIRO identified three potential crash sites — 35.6 degrees S, 92.8 degrees E; 34.7 degrees S, 92.6 degrees E and 35.3 degrees S, 91.8 degrees E.

“So that is a way of potentially narrowing down the search area with the very important caveat that, of course, we can’t be totally sure that those objects seen in the images are actual pieces of plane,” CSIRO oceanographer David Griffin said.

“This might be a really good clue. It might be a red herring. But if you are going to search, then you’d be silly to ignore this potential clue,” he added. The Australian bureau’s Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said in a statement: “Clearly we must be cautious” of the lack a definite link to Flight 370.

Malaysia, China and Australia have decided that the search will remain suspended unless new evidence pinpoints the wreckage’s whereabouts. But seabed exploration company Ocean Infinity, based in Houston, Texas, said last week it has offered to launch a private search for the Malaysian-registered airliner.

Voice370, a support group for victim’s families, said under the terms of the offer made to Malaysia in April, Ocean Infinity “would like to be paid a reward if and only if it finds the main debris field.” They urge Malaysia to accept the offer.

Donald Trump’s Charlottesville remarks a ‘disgrace’: Indian-Americans,"Trump had come under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for his muted response to the violence unleashed by white supremacists during a rally in Charlottesville (File) Trump had come under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for his muted response to the violence unleashed by white supremacists during a rally in Charlottesville (File)

Indian-Americans have condemned US President Donald Trump’s remarks blaming “both sides” for the Charlottesville violence and termed his defence of neo-Nazi groups and white supremacists as a “disgrace”.

Trump had come under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for his muted response to the violence unleashed by white supremacists during a rally in Charlottesville in Virginia in which a woman was killed and 19 others were injured when a car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters.

The president reverted yesterday to his initial position that both left and right-wing extremists became violent during the weekend rally and blamed both sides including the “alt-left”.

“I think there’s blame on both sides. If you look at both sides – I think there’s blame on both sides. I have no doubt about it, and you don’t have any doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say,” Trump said.

Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said the US knew the price of hate too well to deny it, to marginalise it, or to accept David Duke’s twisted view of the world.

“I condemn in the strongest possible terms any moral equivalency between white nationalists and those who would peacefully oppose them,” he said yesterday.

“Thousands of Americans made the ultimate sacrifice in the quest to rid the world of tyranny, oppression and injustice. It is a disgrace to the legacy of those brave men and women – living and dead – for the President to in any way accommodate values so antithetical to those of their nation,” Krishnamoorthi said.

He lamented that it took Trump two days to denounce neo-Nazis, members of the Ku Klux Klan, and other white supremacists and then doubling down on blaming both sides for the violence and defending people who chanted anti-Semitic slogans in a torch-lit rally.

“The scene would have been appalling in Nuremberg in 1937. In 2017, it chilled me to the bone to hear the President of the United States say that some of the participants were ‘very fine people’,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“While it is unconscionable that an American president would defend the actions of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, President Trump is right on one thing: Progressives will not stop our charge for fairness, equality and inclusive policies.

Americans of every political stripe and creed who condemn hate will be charging alongside us,” said Neera Tanden president and CEO of the Center for American Progress.

The people in Charlottesville who opposed the alt-right movement should not be attacked by the president, she said, adding that instead they should be applauded for standing up for American values of equality and inclusion.

“Many were injured and one person died, defending the idea that all people are created equal,” Tanden said.

“It is incredible to me that it is newsworthy in 2017 that the president of the United States has condemned racism and white supremacy,” Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights told podcast Cape Up.

She was the head of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice under Obama Administration.

“President Trump has forfeited any claim to the moral leadership a president must command. His facts are wrong, his moral compass is missing, and his continued refusal to recognise and call out evil and hate is a disgrace to our nation,” she said in a statement.

“Now the rest of us must uphold America’s ideals of fairness, justice and inclusion, because Donald Trump has proven he will not. Those who do not clearly, firmly and unequivocally choose to side against hatred, racial bigotry and intolerance are complicit,” Gupta said.

Congressman Ami Bera said the violence in Charlottesville was an example of what happens when politicians tolerate hatred and bigotry. “As a candidate, Donald Trump knew these hate groups supported his campaign. In both his rhetoric and actions, Trump encouraged these groups to come out of the shadows. He gave groups like the KKK and white supremacists legitimacy and a voice. Sadly, that trend has continued during the Trump presidency,” he said.

Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor will fight in smaller gloves,"Mayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves. (Source: AP) Mayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves. (Source: AP)

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor got their wish to fight in smaller gloves, but not before being chastised by a Nevada boxing official for using the issue to hype their fight later this month.

Nevada boxing regulators on Wednesday gave the two fighters an exemption to a rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for fights at 154 pounds, approving 8-ounce gloves for the Aug. 26 bout. Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.

Commissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.

Commission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.

“I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,” Marnell said.

Under Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.

McGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn’t last four rounds.

“I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don’t believe he makes it out of the second round,” McGregor said. “I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.”

Mayweather’s promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.

“The fight is going to end in a knockout, I’m very confident,” Ellerbe said. “And it will probably be early.”

McGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.

“The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,” said Bob Bennett, the commission’s executive director.

Commissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy’s Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor’s camp had asked for an international judge among the three.

Byrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.

The glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.

Mayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather’s challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.

UFC chief Dana White echoed McGregor in saying the smaller gloves will make a difference in the fight.

“It affects the fight big time,” White said. “When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don’t know what changed but I’m glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.”

Commissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.

“The fight is not normal,” said commissioner Sandra Morgan.

John Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.

“He’ll be 150 pounds. That’s his best weight and there’s no reason to put on extra weight,” Hornewer said.

A McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter the ring somewhere around that weight after making the 154-pound limit the day before.

"Bengal civic polls: Trinamool sweeps all seven bodies, BJP emerges as main challenger","TMC won all seven civic bodies which went to polls last week in West Bengal. (Source: Express Photo/Subham Dutta) TMC won all seven civic bodies which went to polls last week in West Bengal. (Source: Express Photo/Subham Dutta)

The Trinamool Congress on Thursday won all seven civic bodies which went to polls last week. The ruling party made clean sweeps in Durgapur Municipal Corporation, which is the largest civic body among the seven, Haldia Municipality and Coopers’ Camp Notified Area. Opposition parties failed to make their mark in any of the civic bodies.

The BJP remained second after it won four out of sixteen wards in Dhupguri Municipality and one ward each in Panskura and Buniadpur municipalities. The CPM-led Left Front won Nalhati Municipality while Congress failed to secure any seat. Out of 148 wards in seven civic bodies, TMC won 140 wards, BJP won 6, Left Front won 1 and an Independent candidate won 1.

“The Opposition did not play a positive and constructive role in the state. They only indulged in attacking the ruling party and criticising the state government. They only competed among themselves and the result is here. Our party won because we are always for development,” TMC Secretary General Partha Chatterjee said.

In Durgapur Municipal Corporation, TMC won all 43 wards. “Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had declared West Burdwan as a separate district for better development and people have showed their full faith on her. We want to thank the people of Durgapur for supporting us. They have foiled BJP’s attempts to disrupt the election in Durgapur by bringing outsiders from Bihar and Jharkhand,” state Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Aroop Biswas told The Indian Express. Biswas was also TMC’s election-in-charge of Durgapur Municipal Corporation.

In East Midnapore districts Haldia Municipality, the TMC won all 29 wards. “In 2012, we had won 11 wards while Left Front had won 15 wards. Despite winning the civic body, they could not complete the full tenure as Opposition councilors defected to our party. People of Haldia understood that they have to elect the ruling party to usher in development,” state Transport Minister and TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari said.

In terms of vote share, BJP emerged second in Haldia. “It is evident from BJP vote share that Left votes got transferred to BJP. However, TMC’s vote share has increased from last time. This time we have received more than 60 per cent votes in Haldia. We are not worried,” Adhikari added. In Panskura Municipality of the same district, TMC won 17 wards out of 18 while BJP won 1.

The party also won all 12 wards in Coopers’ Camp Notified Area in Nadia district. In Jalpaiguri district’s Dhupguri Municipality, TMC won 12 wards out of 16 while BJP won four. This is the only municipality among the seven where TMC lost more than three wards. In Nalhati Municipality in Birbhum district, TMC won 14 wards out of 16 while Left Front won 1 and another ward went to an Independent candidate. In South Dinajpur district’s Buniadpur Municipality, TMC won 13 wards out of 14 while BJP won 1. Apart from BJP, Opposition parties Left Front and Congress failed to make its present in any of the seven civic bodies and were decimated in the civic polls.

If you’re looking for celeb fitness inspiration then Alia Bhatt’s workout routine might make you want to hit the gym. She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn’t like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra’s Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung’s delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that’s what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, “Everyone’s talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I’m eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.”

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. “Who knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,” she wrote.

Amid I-Day Security Lockdown: Jammu & Kashmir police team scrambles for shelter in Walled City,"Security personnel at Red Fort on Independence Day. Express photo by Amit Mehra Security personnel at Red Fort on Independence Day. Express photo by Amit Mehra

A two-member team of officers from Jammu and Kashmir Police, which came to Delhi for an investigation, was denied accommodation at several guesthouses and hotels at Jama Masjid area before the Independence Day celebrations on Monday. Strict security arrangements at Red Fort and its surrounding areas meant that no hotel was ready to give them a room.

A head constable and a constable, posted at a police station in Srinagar, were accompanied by two persons. They were looking for a woman, who was suspected to have disappeared from her village near Srinagar, and were accompanied by the complainants.

They told Delhi Police that they had come in search of the woman, who was suspected to be staying at Jama Masjid.

The men reached Delhi around 7 am and it was only after the intervention of officers at the Jama Masjid police station that they were able to get a room — around five hours later.

The two were in plainclothes but were carrying their identity cards. Sources said the strictness at the Walled City was such that the officers even had to submit details of the vehicle that dropped them to Jama Masjid area from the airport.

Police sources said in many cases, teams from other states do not inform local police that they have come for a raid or a search as they feel information could be leaked.

“In this case too, there was no prior intimation to local police about the visit of the Jammu and Kashmir police team. They said they would inform us after their operation,” a police officer said. “Since, there was information regarding an alleged terrorist from Kashmir hiding near Jama Masjid area, police was on high alert before the Independence Day, said sources.

Police had sensitised hotel and guesthouse owners and had asked them to keep a track of visitors. Sources said police had briefed hotel owners about the suspected terrorist and suspected terror attack.

“On seeing that the men were carrying I-cards of Jammu and Kashmir Police, hotels refused them accommodation. They went to several guesthouses but were turned away,” sources said.

After checking and verifying their identities with state police, the local police station staff then helped them getting accommodation at a guesthouse.

The team stayed in the city till Wednesday afternoon and left for Srinagar following the completion of their operation.

During the process of checking and ensuring security in the walled city, local police had impounded about 50 vehicles from the area.

Flying kites around Red Fort and Jama Masjid was also restricted on and before August 15, sources said.

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange to begin trading this month,"“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil. “We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

* Exchange will allow trade in Egyptian pounds * Bitcoin value has surged in recent months * Egypt has not yet regulated digital currency

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange will go live later this month, the founders of Bitcoin Egypt said, linking the Middle East’s most populous country with a cryptocurrency that has surged in value in recent months.

Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, a volatile digital currency that has captured the interest of speculative investors worldwide as its value has soared, roughly quadrupling since the start of 2017 and trading at around $4,400 on Thursday.

Egypt, most of whose 93 million people have no bank accounts but where electronic payments have grown in recent years, lacks regulations for digital currency. This means local retailers cannot accept it as payment but users on an exchange may be left to trade freely, potentially cashing in on its ascent.

“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

He said the exchange has picked up about 300 pre-registrations from users ahead of its launch.

The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, the country’s financial markets regulator, did not respond to requests for comment. Khalil and co-founder Omar Abdelrasoul see their platform connecting a community of several thousand bitcoin enthusiasts who will for the first time be able to trade in Egyptian pounds, which have roughly halved in value since November after flotation under an International Monetary Fund loan programme.

“Cryptoassets are happening whether (the Egyptian government) joins in or not. And by not joining they’re missing out on a very big market. Currently bitcoin is about a $70 billion market,” said Khalil.

Cryptocurrencies allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks.

Bitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls. This has helped it proliferate in China, the world’s most active bitcoin market, but has led some governments to crack down on its use to prevent money laundering.

Those same dynamics could propel bitcoin in Egypt, where a shortage of hard currency after the 2011 uprising sharply restricted bank transfers. Though liquidity at banks has improved and capital controls have been lifted in recent months, businesses still resort to a black market for dollars to obtain currency not available in the formal banking system.

“We’re trying to get people used to the idea of bitcoin, to ready the market so that in a couple of years we will reach a greater number of users. But for now we are trying to let people know what cryptocurrency is,” said Abdelrasoul.

"Nokia 8 FAQ: Expected India launch, pricing and other questions answered","Nokia 8 FAQ: Everything you need to know about the flagship Android smartphone. Nokia 8 FAQ: Everything you need to know about the flagship Android smartphone.

Nokia 8 is the new flagship from HMD Global, with top-end specifications and a dual rear camera on board. The phone will start shipping from September, and the expected average price of the Nokia 8 will be Euros 599. But when is the phone coming to India? What should you expect in terms of features and specifications? We answer all your questions below

What is the expected India release date for the Nokia 8?

Nokia 8 will come to India by early October and the phone is supposed to start shipping in September globally. If the phone does launch by early October, it should be available in India before Diwali, which means it will go on sale in the important festive season of India. HMD Global has not confirmed whether they will have online or offline sales for the Nokia 8, but that will likely be revealed closer to launch date.

What is the expected price in India for the Nokia 8?

Nokia 8 has a price tag of Euros 599 average, according to the company. Now that comes to nearly Rs 45,000 on conversion, so expect a pricing similar to this when the phone does come to India. This phone is designed in Finland, but all the manufacturing is done in China, so we’ll have to see how that impacts final pricing in India.

Will Nokia 8 launch in single-SIM or dual-SIM in India?

Nokia 8 is launching in both single-SIM and dual-SIM options. However, variant types will depend on the country, and in India we are likely to get the dual-SIM version. The Nokia 8 has a hybrid SIM slot.

What are the key features of the Nokia 8?

Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch 2K display with a maximum brightness of 700 nits. Its got the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage, which is expandable to 256 GB via a microSD card slot. There’s a 13MP + 13MP rear camera which has a coloured and monochrome sensor (OIS is only on the coloured sensor) and a 13MP front camera. Front and rear camera can both record 4K videos. The battery is 3090 mAh with Quick Charge 3.0 and a USB-Type C charging port with USB 3.0 supported.

What’s the ‘Bothie’ on the Nokia 8?

HMD Global is trying hard to make this term ‘Bothie trend’ and offering users the option of shooting from their front and rear camera at the same time. The ‘Dual-Sight’ option lets users shoot a video, take pictures, and even do a live on Facebook or YouTube with both camera visuals being display. So your selfie is one half of the picture, and the other half is framed by whatever you decide to shoot with the rear camera.

Does Nokia 8 have a ‘Portrait mode’? Does it have OIS?

The Nokia 8 does a have portrait mode and it is called live bokeh in the camera app. It lets users shoot a picture where the background is blurred. The rear camera has OIS but this applies only to the RGB sensor. If you shoot in just monochrome, there’s no OIS.

What’s this about OZO Audio on the Nokia 8?

Nokia 8 comes with OZO Audio, which is taken from the Nokia OZO, 360-degree virtual reality camera. The OZO Audio ensures quality sound being recorded when you’re shooting videos from the phone. So if you use the Nokia 8 to say record videos at a concert, it will be able to capture and encode the ambient sound as well. Also HMD Global says when you share these videos on a social media platform, the ambient sound is encoded with the file and a user can have a rich sound quality experience.

What’s the OS on Nokia 8?

Nokia 8 is running Android Nougat 7.1.1 with the latest August Security patch. However, HMD Global says they are already deep in development on Android O for this phone, and promise one of the fastest upgrades to the new OS. There’s no bloatware on Nokia 8, and it sticks with stock Android UI seen on the other Nokia-branded phones.

Teen who saved 10-year-old girl from drowning felicitated,"A Class Vth student, Muskan Pathan, fell into the flooding Kukadi Canal when Vaibhav jumped to save her. Express A Class Vth student, Muskan Pathan, fell into the flooding Kukadi Canal when Vaibhav jumped to save her. Express

Vaibhav Gaikwad (13), who was in the news recently for saving a 10-year-old girl from drowning in Kukadi Canal, Junnar, has been felicitated by the USK Foundation. A Class Vth student at Jagdamba School, Jadhavwadi, Muskan Pathan, was passing near the Kukadi Canal on her way back home from school.

The canal was flooded due to heavy rainfall and she fell into the waters. While other students raised an alarm, Vaibhav flung into the water and saved Muskan. Dr Usha Kakade of the foundation said, “Instead of just being a spectator, Vaibhav took a major step and saved Muskan from drowning. I will recommend his name for the national awards.”

Expressing his gratitude, Vaibhav said, “When I saw Muskan drowning, I jumped into the water without a second thought. I could see her hands in the canal. While saving her, I held a nearby tree but that too was uprooted due to the force of water. Later, I managed to hold on to another tree and brought Muskan out of the flow. The strong flow of the water was tiring but I am happy that I could save her life.”

Passengers sue Boeing 777-300 for 2016 Emirates crash in Dubai,"Representational purpose. Representational purpose.

Passengers who were aboard an Emirates plane that crash-landed in August 2016 are suing Chicago-based Boeing for an alleged malfunction of the aircraft’s electronics. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court alleges the aircraft’s electronics system prevented the operation of a switch at a critical moment. More than a dozen passengers involved in the lawsuit claim the system didn’t provide any warning to the crew that the switch wasn’t working. The Emirates Boeing 777-300 flying from India crash-landed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. All 300 people aboard survived, scrambling down emergency slides before flames destroyed the plane. A firefighter was killed battling the blaze.

UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority earlier this month determined there were no mechanical problems leading up to the incident.

A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuit, noting the litigation is pending.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu’s correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that “distant neighbour” of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan’s rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named “Beard” and “Chubby”) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

“I could walk around,” she writes, “and meet nice people”. “I had many friends and they were always helpful and kind”. She talks of “a senior politician who treated me like his daughter”. “Many parliamentarians were friendly,” she remarks, “even if they made anti-Indian statements.” A startling revelation is that “one place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office”! Elsewhere, she remarks, “this unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming”. “Pakistani writers and journalists were always accessible” and “helped me understand their country”. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches “Bharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis” and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s “Art of Living”: “We do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session”. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: “Love is a force, it’s like the sea, it cannot break”. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, “The Man from Pakistan”, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib’s assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: “this young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor”.

She contrasts “most of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state” with “visitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.” While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, “the community lives on the razor’s edge”) she also finds space for “Pandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi” asserting, somewhat startlingly, that “the Hindu community was not targeted in any way”.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the “deep state” and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. “Journalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused…life hung on a thread”. Yet, “journalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave”. She concludes, “The government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will”.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: “there is no low both countries cannot stoop to.” Her final message is: “there is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own”.

China warns of retaliation as Donald Trump launches trade probe,"Trump said the US would no longer tolerate Beijing’s “theft” of US industrial secrets, long a concern of major foreign corporations seeking a share of huge Chinese market. (File/Photo) Trump said the US would no longer tolerate Beijing’s “theft” of US industrial secrets, long a concern of major foreign corporations seeking a share of huge Chinese market. (File/Photo)

Trade tensions between the United States and China heated up on Tuesday as Beijing warned that it “will not sit idle” if a US probe into its intellectual property practices leads to sanctions. President Donald Trump’s decision to order the investigation comes on top of strains between the two nations over how to handle Beijing’s ally North Korea. Trump yesterday signed a memorandum directing US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether Chinese policies hurt American investors or companies — with retaliatory measures a possible outcome.

“We will stand up to any country that unlawfully forces American companies to transfer their valuable technology as a condition of market access. We will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs,” Trump said.

“We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that is so vital to our security and to our prosperity.

“Washington will turn a blind eye no longer,” Trump insisted.

The president said the US would no longer tolerate Beijing’s “theft” of US industrial secrets, long a concern of major foreign corporations seeking a share of the huge Chinese market.

“We will engage in a thorough investigation and, if needed, take action to preserve the future of US industry,” Lighthizer said.

China’s commerce ministry issued a statement voicing “serious concern” and warning that any US trade protectionism “will definitely harm bilateral trade relations”.

“If the US side take actions that impair the mutual trade relations, disregarding the facts and disrespecting multilateral trade rules, China will not sit idle,” the statement said.

The ministry said the country “is definitely going to adopt all appropriate measures to vigorously defend the lawful rights and interest of China.”

The United States is China’s second-largest trading partner after the European Union, but Washington and Beijing have seen their relations grow increasingly fraught since a promising summit between Trump and China’s Xi Jinping in April.

The new intellectual property inquiry joins numerous investigations launched by Washington into Chinese trade practices, notably those concerning steel and aluminum and their national security consequences, which the Trump administration began earlier this year.

However, the start of a US inquiry will not immediately result in open confrontation.

Lighthizer will first need to reach a preliminary finding of unfair practices by China before opening a formal investigation, which could take as much as a year, administration officials said.

The Chinese commerce ministry said the country has “always been paying high attention to intellectual property right protection, continuously perfecting the legislation”, and that the progress it has made on that front is “obvious to all”.

Since launching his successful run for the White House and then taking office, Trump has frequently accused China of undermining the US economy.

The bilateral US trade deficit with China approached USD 350 billion in 2016, and Trump has repeatedly blamed Chinese imports for gutting employment in US sectors such as steel.

Last week, Washington announced preliminary sanctions against Chinese imports of aluminium foil. But so far, the US has not imposed heavier trade measures on Chinese goods.

On Thursday, Trump reiterated the suggestion that he could soften his position on trade if Beijing were to do more to help rein in nuclear-armed North Korea.

“If China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade,” he said.

China said it would halt iron, iron ore and seafood imports from North Korea starting Tuesday, in accordance with new UN sanctions that Beijing voted to approve.

US administration officials, however, have denied any link between the latest trade action and Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.

Beijing echoed this view Monday, with the foreign ministry saying the two matters were “totally different.”

Despite Monday’s expected action, Trump has so far refrained from making good on threats of retaliatory trade measures against China.

This includes in particular concerns over Beijing’s requirement that foreign companies establish local joint ventures. According to Washington, this can mean surrendering technological know-how to Chinese partners.

Hong Kong democracy leader defiant as three jailed for months,"An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday. (Representational Image) An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday. (Representational Image)

An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday, dealing a blow to the Chinese-ruled city’s youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference. Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 24, and Nathan Law, 26, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but Hong Kong’s Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

Wong was jailed for six months, Chow for seven months and Law for eight months. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit. The three appeared stern but calm as their sentences were delivered by a panel of three judges.

The former British colony, which has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by nearly three months of mostly peaceful street occupations in late 2014, demanding Beijing grant the city full democracy. The so-called “Umbrella Movement” civil disobedience movement, that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters at its peak, was triggered after Wong and his colleagues stormed into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters.

They were later charged with participating in and inciting an unlawful assembly. Just before sentencing, a defiant Wong told around one hundred supporters who thronged into the High Court lobby, some weeping, that he had no regrets and urged them to keep fighting for full democracy.

“I hope Hong Kong people won’t give up. Victory is ours. When we are released next year I hope we can see a Hong Kong that is full of hope. I want to see Hong Kong people not giving up. This is my last wish before I go to jail.” Wong also told Reuters earlier that Hong Kong’s democratic movement was facing its “darkest era” and that he’d lost confidence in the city’s vaunted legal system, long considered one of the best in Asia.

The Department of Justice said in an earlier statement that the trio were not convicted for exercising their civil liberties, but because their conduct during the protest included “disorderly and intimidating behaviour”. It added there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive”.

Critics disagreed

“The outlandish application seeking jail time is not about public order but is instead a craven political move to keep the trio out of the Legislative Council, as well as deter future protests,” China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement on Wednesday. Hong Kong enjoys a free judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

The jail terms will curtail the political ambitions of the trio, barring them for running for seats in the legislature for the next five years. In recent months, dozens of protesters, mostly young people, have been jailed for their roles in various protests, including a violent demonstration that the government called a riot in early 2016.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.

Blaise Matuidi having a medical at Juventus ahead of move from PSG,"In all, Blaise Matuidi has won four league titles, three French Cups and four League Cups with PSG. (Source: Reuters) In all, Blaise Matuidi has won four league titles, three French Cups and four League Cups with PSG. (Source: Reuters)

Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Blaise Matuidi was having a medical at Juventus on Wednesday ahead of a potential move to the Serie A club. Juventus said that Matuidi arrived at Turin airport in the afternoon and was undergoing tests.

Juventus will reportedly pay PSG 20 million euros ($23 million) plus bonuses for the 30-year-old Matuidi, who had a year left on his contract with the French club.

PSG, which is also trying to balance the books after buying Neymar for 222 million euros, could not afford to lose Matuidi on a free transfer.

Matuidi played nearly 300 games for PSG in all competitions after joining from Saint-Etienne in 2011.

After a difficult first season, he quickly became an integral part of the team for successive managers, Carlo Ancelotti and Laurent Blanc. He flourished from a largely defensive midfielder to a robust, tireless runner with an eye for goal and an enormous work-rate.

Overcoming some technical deficiencies in his game, Matuidi gradually earned himself a place in the France lineup and became a key player at the 2014 World Cup and last year’s European Championship.

At the beginning of last season, after Blanc was fired and replaced by Unai Emery, he expressed a desire to leave PSG and already wanted to join Juventus. But the club blocked his move, considering him too important to leave, and he stayed for another season.

Altogether, Matuidi has scored 33 goals for PSG in 295 appearances, becoming a well-respected player among fans and teammates alike, often taking a public stance when others would not and when tensions arose within the club.

In all, Matuidi has won four league titles, three French Cups and four League Cups with PSG.

Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe says agreed with Donald Trump that halting North Korean missile launches was priority,"Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (AP Photo) Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (AP Photo)

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he agreed with President Donald Trump during a telephone call on Tuesday that their top priority regarding North Korea was to do what they could to halt missile launches by the regime.

“Through a firm partnership between Japan and the U.S. and cooperating with China, Russia and the international community we agreed that our priority was to work to ensure that North Korea doesn’t launch more missiles,” Abe told reporter after he spoke to Trump.

Abe said he also praised a commitment by Trump that the United States would ensure the security of the United State’s allies in the region as threats from North Korea intensify.

Under an alliance treaty with the United States, Washington has pledged to defend Japan. Japan will ask the U.S. to reaffirm that commitment in high-level talks in Washington this week.

"Ban superbikes, says family of man who died","Police say that the youngster was racing with his friends. Police say that the youngster was racing with his friends.

“Superbikes are not meant to be driven around in our country. In western countries, such as the US and UK, there are appropriate arrangements. These bikes should be banned; no one else should go through the same pain,” said Ankush Bansal, elder brother of Himanshu Bansal who died after he lost control of his bike and crashed into the boundary wall of Lady Irwin college on Monday night.

Police, however, maintained that the youngster was racing with his friends. “They were driving in a rash manner…They could have put someone’s life at risk,” a police officer privy to the investigation said.

The family, however, denied the claims and insisted that Himanshu had been busy running errands. “He was going to get some lights from CP. He was supposed to spend Janmashtami with us,” Ankush said.

"We, the People: Sketching illustrations for the Constitution of India","A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo) A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo)

While the founding fathers of the Constitution were framing the laws that would govern India, miles from the capital, Delhi, Nandalal Bose and his students in Santiniketan were sketching illustrations that would feature in the manuscript, and would encapsulate India’s rich history, diversity and unity. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had reportedly proposed that Bose work on the Constitution of India, where the text, too, was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada in flowing italic.

For the world’s longest written Constitution — now carefully kept in the library of the Parliament of India — Bose and his team designed a total of 22 illustrations. Borrowing from Indian miniature tradition, Ajanta frescoes and what came to be defined as the Santiniketan style, intricate frames surround the text. The depictions span different periods. If the initial part has the popular Indus Valley seal mark, the Zebu bull, the Vedic period is represented by a scene from gurukul. We see scenes from various eras, including the Mauryan and Mughal empire, and the dancing Nataraja from the Chola tradition. The freedom movement is portrayed with a figure of Mahatma Gandhi during the Dandi March, and another frame has Subhash Chandra Bose.

Our epics find representation, too. From the Ramayana, there is Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home; a scene from the Mahabharata has Krishna and Arjun in conversation. Buddha and Mahavira are also part of the Constitution, where the varied geographical terrain of India is also celebrated.

Priyanka Chopra stuns in this sheer black dress but fails to deliver in the white summery number,"Priyanka Chopra is polishing her style game in New York. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries, cristinaehrlich) Priyanka Chopra is polishing her style game in New York. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries, cristinaehrlich)

The last time we spotted Priyanka Chopra, she totally floored us with her drop-dead gorgeous appearance in a nude satin gown at the Manhattan set of her upcoming Hollywood film Isn’t It Romantic, co-starring Liam Hemsworth. The lovely number with a plunging neckline and a thigh-high slit, accentuated her curves perfectly. The beautiful actor – who is currently juggling two other projects, A Kid Like Jake, starring Jim Parsons and Claire Danes and Quantico – took some time out from her busy schedule to shake a leg with Jamie Foxx at Ron Perlman’s Apollo Fundraiser and much to our delight, she did it in style!

This gorgeous beauty was seen in a black sheer number with a plunging neckline and a dangerously thigh-high slit from Fendi. A diamond studded brooch pinned on the front added instant glamour to the look, but we think even without one she would have looked good – that is the beauty of the dress.

She complemented the look with black peep toe heels, her signature brown lip shade, soft make-up and gorgeously tousled hair.

On another occasion the actor was seen in a breezy, white flowy maxi with a plunging neckline. Three things about this look we like the most is her outfit, her burnt orange lip shade (something we would definitely want to get our hands on) and her beautifully done hair.

But that choker is something we would never pick as an accessory to this summery dress. We like the idea but definitely not the execution.

What about you? Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

North Korea likely capable of making missile engines without imports: US,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks at a rocket warhead tip after a simulated test of atmospheric re-entry of a ballistic missile, at an unidentified location in this undated photo released by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on March 15, 2016.

(Source: REUTERS/KCNA/File)

North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines and intelligence suggests it does not need to rely on imports, US intelligence officials said on Tuesday. The assessment disputes a new study by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies that said that the engines for a nuclear missile North Korea is developing to hit the United States likely were made in factories in Ukraine or Russia and probably obtained via black market networks.

The New York Times cited the study on Monday. The newspaper’s report said that classified assessments by US intelligence agencies mirrored the IISS finding. “We have intelligence to suggest that North Korea is not reliant on imports of engines,” one US intelligence official told Reuters. “Instead, we judge they have the ability to produce the engines themselves.”

The US officials did not disclose any details of what underpinned the assessment on the high-performance liquid-fueled engines, called RD-250’s. Ukraine denied that it had ever supplied defense technology to North Korea. The Ukrainian factory cited in The New York Times, state-owned Yuzhmash, said it had not produced military-grade ballistic missiles since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

Another US intelligence official said that the modifications to the RD-250 that resulted in improved reliability may have relied in part on foreign scientists recruited by North Korea or been developed by North Koreans educated in Russia or elsewhere.

Ukraine is supported by the United States in its fight against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The IISS study, which coincides with tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, said the engines probably came from the Ukrainian Yuzhmash plant.

The study based its conclusions mainly on photographs published by North Korea of missile engines that it ground-tested in September and March and flight-tested on Hwasong-12 and Hwasong-14 missiles in May and July. Hwasong-12 is an intermediate-range rocket and Hwasong-14 is an intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea has designed to reach the US mainland.

By comparing the engines in the photographs to others, it found that they likely were modified versions of the RD-250 produced by Yuzhmash and accounted for sudden successes in North Korean missile tests following a slew of failures. The IISS study is also being disputed by some leading independent nuclear weapons experts.

“It’s completely wrong,” asserted Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

Lewis said his research team performed measurements independent from each other on the same photographs used in the IISS study and determined that they were of different sizes. They concluded that the motors for the North Korean ICBM likely were indigenously built.

Lewis also pointed to a Jan. 17, 2016, US Treasury announcement of US financial sanctions on Iranian firms for helping North Korea develop the engine that was tested in November and most closely resembles the Ukrainian engine.

“To me, they don’t look like those (RD-250s) engines except in the way that all (rocket) engines look,” Lewis said.

"Barcelona can cope without Neymar, says Ernesto Valverde","Ernesto Valverde is confident his side can cope without Neymar. (Source: AP) Ernesto Valverde is confident his side can cope without Neymar. (Source: AP)

Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde is confident his side can cope without Neymar against La Liga champions Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. Paris Saint-Germain raided Barcelona for the Brazilian winger earlier in August, leaving the Catalans with 222 million euros ($262.32 million) but a gaping hole in their strike force.

Barcelona take on rivals Real on Sunday in the Super Cup first leg with no replacement yet for the Brazilian striker — although media reports have linked them to Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele and Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho.

“For Neymar’s absence I have a lot of players who are ready to play,” Valverde told a news conference on Saturday. “You have to look forward, not back.”

The former Athletic Bilbao manager, however, doubts whether Gerard Deulofeu is ready to fill the gap following his recent return from injury.

Barcelona brought Deulofeu back from Everton this summer but he missed the club’s pre-season tour with a reported muscle strain and has featured in only one friendly.

“I like the understanding between Deulofeu with (Jordi) Alba and (Lionel) Messi, but we only have one reference point, the Gamper (trophy) against Chapecoense. It’s very soon,” said Valverde.

Instead the coach might look to Paco Alcacer to play on the left, or change formation from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 to match Real Madrid, and incorporate an extra midfielder, which could be Sergi Roberto, whom Valverde praised.

Replacing Neymar in the long term is a difficult task, though, and defender Gerard Pique told a news conference of his desperate attempt to get him to stay.

Pique tweeted a picture of himself and Neymar with the caption, “he stays”, little over a week before the Brazilian departed.

“I don’t feel tricked by Neymar. The day I said ‘he stays’ I knew that he was going 100 per cent. It was the final shot,” said Pique.

“He got angry with me but we worked it out. I did it to use my social networks to help this club to keep a player who has a unique talent. It was difficult but I tried to help my club.”

Karolina Pliskova celebrated her return to the tournament that helped launch her rise to world number one with a 6-2 6-3 win over Russian Natalia Vikhlyantseva in the second round of the Cincinnati Open on Wednesday.

Two celebrated seeds fell, with number three Angelique Kerber and ninth-seeded Venus Williams upset in three-setters, disrupting their U.S. Open preparations.

Kerber lost 6-4 1-6 7-6(11) to Russian Ekaterina Makarova, while Williams was upset 6-3 2-6 6-2 by Australian qualifier Ashleigh Barty in second-round matches.

Barty will face former world number one Caroline Wozniacki, a 6-2 6-4 winner against Russia’s Elena Vesnina, in the last 16.

Top seed Pliskova rose to the occasion on the key points.

She saved all five break points she faced, while losing just three points behind her first serve against the Russian, who reached her first WTA final at Den Bosch in June.

Last year Pliskova beat Kerber in the Cincinnati final, stopping the German from ascending to number one with the biggest victory of her career up to then.

Pliskova went on to have a brilliant Flushing Meadows run, beating both Venus and Serena Williams on the way to the final, sparking a consistent stretch that helped her succeed Kerber atop the rankings after Wimbledon.

Next up for the 25-year-old Czech is a third-round match against Italian Camila Giorgi, who beat Australian Daria Gavrilova 7-6(1) 5-7 6-3.

American 16th seed Madison Keys beat Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-1 to reach the last 16, where she will face Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza of Spain.

For the second week in a row, American Sloane Stephens defeated 14th seed Petra Kvitova, who was bothered by pain in her right thigh, to reach the third round with a 6-2 6-3 win.

Stephens, sidelined almost a year due to a foot injury before returning at Wimbledon, beat Kvitova last week in three sets in Toronto on her way to the semi-finals.

Up next for Stephens will be the on-form Makarova.

Chris Froome looking forward to the Vuelta double bid,"Chris Froome will have only had 25 days to rest before Saturday’s Grand Depart in Nimes. (Source: AP) Chris Froome will have only had 25 days to rest before Saturday’s Grand Depart in Nimes. (Source: AP)

The Vuelta is where everything started for Chris Froome and it could well be where he moves closer to the greatest grand tour riders as the Tour de France champion attempts a unique double in the modern era.

Only Frenchmen Jacques Anquetil (1963) and Bernard Hinault (1973) have achieved that feat, but the Spanish race was then held in April-May.

Froome, instead, will have only had 25 days to rest before Saturday’s Grand Depart in Nimes, France. “I’ve got the opportunity and I’m certainly going to go for it,” Froome said. “The Vuelta is a race I love – it’s vicious but it’s three weeks that I enjoy.”

Froome has had his share of disappointment in the Vuelta, losing by 13 seconds to Spain’s Juan Jose Cobo in 2011, the year he came to prominence, before settling again for second in 2014 and 2016.

Last year, the Team Sky rider effectively lost his chances after being trapped behind following an unexpected attack in a downhill by Alberto Contador, who will take part in his last race before heading into retirement.

The Spaniard, who won the last of his seven grand tour titles at the 2015 Giro d’Italia, is not among the top favourites after finishing ninth overall in the Tour, where Froome prevailed for the fourth time.

He will see some familiar faces in Nimes as Italian Fabio Aru, fellow Briton Simon Yates and Frenchman Romain Bardet — third overall in Paris — also embark on the three-week journey.

The race starts with a team time trial in Nimes and there will only be one solo effort against the clock but Froome should get the chance to gain time on his rivals in the 42-km flat individual time trial – a discipline in which he usually excels.

One of his rivals will be Italian Vincenzo Nibali, while Briton Adam Yates is the only top contender who has not taken part in the Tour de France and should arrive fresher.

“I will be in perfect shape for the Vuelta,” said Nibali, who with Contador is one of six riders with titles in all three grand tours.

Should it be a tight race, it might be decided on the penultimate day at the top of the Angliru mountain road, known as one of the hardest climbs in cycling.

The Vuelta will be without title holder Nairo Quintana as the Colombian is worn out after trying — and failing — to win the Giro/Tour double.

Lalu Yadav accuses Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of murdering democracy,"“Nitish Kumar is wounded, he has choked democracy,” Lalu Prasad Yadav said on Thursday. (File – ANI photo) “Nitish Kumar is wounded, he has choked democracy,” Lalu Prasad Yadav said on Thursday. (File – ANI photo)

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of ‘murdering democracy’ after his son and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav was denied permission to hold a rally in Bhagalpur. Lalu said, “Nitish Kumar is wounded, he has choked democracy.” He also took a dig at Kumar over his ‘zero tolerance’ policy on corruption by talking about Bhagalpur NGO scam and demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter. “The CBI should probe into the Srijan scam and put these people behind the bars,” he said.

Tejashwi Yadav was supposed to address a rally on the scam in Bhagalpur on Thursday morning. On Wednesday night he tweeted that CM Nitish imposed section 144 in the area to prevent the rally from taking place. He sat on protest outside Bhagalpur Railway Station, claiming he was not being given a place to stay in the Circuit House.

On Thursday, Tejashwi also accused CM Nitish Kumar of pressurising media outlets not to report on the Bhagalpur NGO scam. A special investigation team (SIT) of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) is investigating the scam. A total of 11 persons have been arrested so far.

The NGO Srijan Mahila Udyog Samiti Limited is accused of siphoning off state funds through its accounts and accounts of its employees and bank officials. According to police, the amount could be more than Rs 600 crores. The NGO was founded by Manorama Devi and is being run by her son and his wife after her death.

Censoring Sarkar,"It is easy to believe that it was NDA diktat that led to the blacking out of Manik Sarkar on DD and AIR in Tripura on I-Day. If it was not, the government must say so. It is easy to believe that it was NDA diktat that led to the blacking out of Manik Sarkar on DD and AIR in Tripura on I-Day. If it was not, the government must say so.

The blackout by Doordarshan and AIR of the customary Independence Day speech of Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar casts a dark shadow the day after. By all accounts, after a local official raised an objection, the decision not to broadcast the CM’s speech — unless it was “reshaped” — was taken at Prasar Bharati’s Delhi office. In arrogating to itself the powers of a censor over an elected chief minister, the public broadcaster has revived serious questions about its mandate, its degree of autonomy from political-governmental control, and its very relevance in a quick-changing media environment.

There is, to be sure, a broadcasting code that schoolmarmishly sets its face against an array of perceived discourtesies and transgressions, ranging from “criticism of friendly countries” to “anything obscene or defamatory”, to “anything affecting the integrity of the nation”. But that such an imprecise and loosely worded code should be invoked by the public broadcaster to curb the freedom of an elected CM to talk to the people on a day the nation celebrates its freedoms, is outrageous. Related | Did tell Tripura CM Manik Sarkar to reshape his Independence Day speech, Prasar Bharati admits

The speech itself — excerpted today on the Ideas Page – could, at worst, be described as politically charged. Without naming any party or individual, Sarkar spoke of a secularism “under attack”, and of “conspiracies and attempts” to create “divisions in society” that are “contrary to the goals, dreams and ideals of our freedom struggle”. In fact, the chief minister’s speech was no more political than any speech made by any of his counterparts in other states on the day. Read the Manik Sarkar speech that did not pass the AIR test

Despite a 20-year-long career, and reports and recommendations of several committees, the Prasar Bharati is yet to restructure its operations either to respond to the requirements of changing times, or to establish a record of impartiality and fairplay. Successive governments have also been reluctant to give up control over a captive medium. The censorship in Agartala, therefore, immediately invites suspicions about the role of the Central government in the blackout of an Opposition leader. Read | Doordarshan, AIR blacked out my Independence Day speech, told me reshape it: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar

The NDA is particularly vulnerable to these charges, of course. In its three years in power, it has shown a distinctive intolerance of dissent and the political opponent. It has carried this into spaces that must be insulated from the zero-sum games of electoral battle, and that call for political give-and-take. It has taken recourse to the logic of majoritarianism to have its way even in institutions that must be governed by constitutional norms and principles not subject to the numbers game. It is easy to believe that it was NDA diktat that led to the blacking out of Manik Sarkar on DD and AIR in Tripura on I-Day. If it was not, the government must say so.

North Korea fight is latest conflict for indigenous people of Guam,"US island territory Guam. (Source: Google maps) US island territory Guam. (Source: Google maps)

The threatened missile attack by North Korea on Guam has prompted calls for peace from the island’s indigenous people. The Chamorros are weary of yet another conflict after enduring centuries of hostilities. About one-third of the US territory’s 160,000 people identify as Chamorro.

They have endured colonization by Spanish settlers, bloody skirmishes during World War II and a steady escalation of American military presence on the island. An expert on Guam says it would be “disastrous and tragic beyond words” for the island’s indigenous culture if it were targeted in a war between the US and North Korea.

University of Guam Chamorro studies assistant professor Michael Lujan Bavacqua says the bones of the Chamorro people are buried in the soil of Guam and its neighboring islands.

Business execs shunned Donald Trump panels before he disbanded them,"U.S. President Donald Trump. Reuters photo U.S. President Donald Trump. Reuters photo

President Donald Trump had pushed many of America’s top corporate leaders to the breaking point with his inability to decisively condemn white supremacists so they huddled on an 11:30 a.m. conference call Wednesday.

The frustrated members of the White House policy forum which included executives from General Electric, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Boeing, IBM and JPMorgan Chase chose to dissolve their advisory panel. The White House was then phoned and Trump agreed that it was the right course of action, according to four people familiar with the talks who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.

It was a shocking setback for Trump. The president had reveled in his ability to draw billionaires and corporate titans into the Oval Office, where he touted deals to invest in factories and add factory jobs. But by equating the white supremacists whose actions led to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia to a group of counter-protesters, Trump had already inflicted damage on his manufacturing jobs council which had seven departures by Wednesday morning.

So after learning about this latest loss of confidence by his former strategic and policy forum, Trump tried to put a more favorable spin on the defections.

He fired off a tweet Wednesday saying that he chose to disband his strategy forum and manufacturing jobs panel, “rather than putting pressure” on CEOs to stay. “Thank you all!” the president wrote.

The alliance with the White House forged in hopes of overhauling the tax code, cutting regulations and jumpstarting new infrastructure investments had turned into a risk for corporate leaders. For those CEOs with shared policy aims, Trump’s recent statements were distractions that risked alienating employees and customers in an increasingly diverse United States.

“It is a leader’s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,” said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in a statement. Dimon also chairs the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, that recently launched a multi-million dollar advertising campaign in support of Trump’s calls to cut corporate and personal tax rates.

GE’s chairman Jeffrey Immelt called the president’s remarks “deeply troubling.” The “ongoing tone” had made it difficult to foster policies that help economic growth, he said.

Companies were facing pressure on social media to denounce the president and resign from the White House advisory boards, while companies that had already cut ties were facing possible boycotts from Trump supporters. Only by acting together and having those panels disbanded would they be able to avoid harsher scrutiny not just from the public but also from a president with a track record of blasting individual companies that cross him on Twitter.

“The problem was it was quickly becoming a litmus test for companies, CEOs and brands,” said Timothy Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University. “This move takes away that issue because it allows everyone to back away without being seen as backing away.”

After Trump’s initial equivocating on Saturday about protests that stemmed from a planned removal of a Confederate statute, executives began to leave his manufacturing and jobs council. First was Merck, then Under Armour and Intel, followed by the Alliance for American Manufacturing and the AFL-CIO.

But many companies among the 28 represented on the panel sent out statements saying they believed it was important to engage with the White House.

Then Trump, for the second time, on Tuesday afternoon suggested that there was little difference between the actions of white supremacists groups and those protesting them in Virginia.

“There is blame on both sides,” he said, saying that any of the previous departures were due to companies being embarrassed about making goods overseas.

Shortly after those remarks on Tuesday, a pre-cautionary statement was drafted to disband the strategic and policy forum by Stephen Schwarzman, chair of the group and head of the investment firm Blackstone. The statement was adopted by the members of the forum on Wednesday morning as part of the decision to dissolve. The statement said they support “an inclusive pro-growth agenda” but that the debate about their relationship with the White House had become a “distraction.”

Still, the dissolution showed clear doubts in Trump’s leadership, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.

“The emperor is naked,” Sonnenfeld said. There had already been departures from two major councils created by the Trump administration that were tied to its policies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

But the disbanding of the advisory panels on Wednesday reflected grave doubts in Trump’s leadership rather than policy differences.

Larry Fink of the investment firm BlackRock told employees in a memo, “Such racism and bigotry must not just be condemned, but must be condemned unequivocally.”

German Justice Minister Heiko Maas accuses Donald Trump of ‘glossing over right-wing violence’,"Heiko Maas condemned Donald Trump for his comments on the Charlottesville incident. (Source: Reuters) Heiko Maas condemned Donald Trump for his comments on the Charlottesville incident. (Source: Reuters)

German Justice Minister Heiko Maas on Wednesday condemned US President Donald Trump’s latest comments on the violence stemming from a white supremacist rally in Virginia, saying no one should play down anti-Semitism or neo-Nazi racism. On Tuesday Trump provoked further controversy when he said that those who had been protesting against the right-wing activists were partly responsible for the violence.

Trump’s comments came a day after he had bowed to pressure to explicitly condemn the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and other white supremacist groups. “It is unbearable how Trump is now glossing over the violence of the right-wing hordes from Charlottesville,” Maas said in a statement, reflecting concern across the German political spectrum about the Trump presidency. “No one should trivialise anti-Semitism and racism by neo-Nazis,” Maas said. Maas – a Social Democrat member of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition – is the highest-ranking German politician to address the latest switch in Trump’s rhetoric about the violence.

Germany has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled from 1933 until their defeat in 1945. Merkel had told broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action was required to combat right-wing extremism, noting that Germans had also seen a rise in anti-Semitism and had “quite a lot to do at home ourselves”. Trump has come under increasing pressure over his stance on the violence, with many members of his own Republican party and U.S. business executives distancing themselves from him.

Trump on Tuesday maintained that his original reaction was based on the facts he had at the time, and insisted that both sides were to blame. The violence erupted in Charlottesville on Saturday during a protest by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the American Civil War. Protesters and counter-protesters clashed in scattered street brawls before a car ploughed into the rally’s opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people. A 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, said to have harboured Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder.

The driver of a tractor-trailer packed with people illegally entering the United States in an alleged human smuggling operation has been indicted on charges related to the deaths of 10 people inside. James Matthew Bradley Jr was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury in San Antonio on five counts, including a count of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death, and a separate count of conspiracy to transport immigrants illegally, resulting in death.

Those charges carry the possibility of the death penalty. A spokesman for the US Attorney’s office in San Antonio declined to say if prosecutors would pursue the death penalty.

One of Bradley’s attorneys did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Bradley was also indicted on two counts related to illegally transporting immigrants resulting in serious bodily injury, and one count of firearm possession by a convicted felon. The indictment alleges Bradley, who pleaded guilty in 1997 to a felony domestic violence case in Colorado, was in possession of a .38-caliber pistol.

At least 39 people were inside the trailer as it drove from the border city of Laredo to San Antonio, about 240 kilometres north. The trailer’s refrigeration system was broken, and investigators said passengers struggled to breathe as the temperature rose to dangerous levels. One witness told The Associated Press he heard people crying and asking for water.

Twenty-two survivors have been released from the hospital and are being held in detention as potential witnesses against Bradley. Two survivors remained hospitalised as of yesterday.

Four of the survivors testified before the grand jury, said Michael McCrum, a San Antonio attorney appointed to represent them.

“They came to America wanting just to work, as they could not find a job in Mexico that could support their families. And yet, the circumstances of what happened brought them to this situation,” McCrum said in an email.

“They were asked to tell the truth about how they suffered, and they did.”

Investigators have said they believe Bradley was part of a broader conspiracy funding and planning the smuggling operation, though they have not announced any additional arrests or charges.

According to a criminal complaint released in July, Bradley told investigators that the trailer had been sold and he was transporting it for his boss from Iowa to Brownsville, Texas. But said he had driven to Laredo and stopped twice there before driving back to San Antonio, in the opposite direction from Brownsville.

He denied knowing people were inside the trailer. After hearing banging and shaking, he opened the door and was “surprised when he was run over by ‘Spanish’ people and knocked to the ground,” according to the criminal complaint.

Human smuggling operations often linked to Mexican drug cartels are a major problem for law enforcement along the United States’ southern border. Border Patrol agents in West Texas found 20 people crammed in a semitrailer just this week, one day after police in the border city of Edinburg discovered 16 people inside another trailer.

Most of the people known to have been on board were from Mexico. Others are believed to have fled from the truck after it stopped.

The US Attorney’s office identified eight of the 10 people who died.

According to the US Attorney, seven were from Mexico: 27 -year-old Ruben Hernandez Vargas; 21-year-old Osbaldo Rodriguez Cerda; 26-year-old Jorge Reyes Noveron; 36-year-old Jose Rodriguez Aspeitia; 37-year-old Benjamin Martinez Arredondo; 24-year-old Ricardo Martinez Esparza; and Mariano Lopez Cano, whose age is unknown. Another person, Frank Fuentes, was from Guatemala. A Guatemalan diplomat previously told the AP that Fuentes had been deported and was trying to return to his family in Maryland.

Lopez Cano and Martinez Esparza died at an area hospital.

Veterans get expanded college assistance under Donald Trump,"Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo) Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo)

Military veterans are getting unlimited access to college assistance under legislation President Donald Trump has signed into law. The Forever GI Act removed a 15-year limit on using the benefits, effective immediately. The measure increases financial assistance for National Guard and Reserve members, building on a 2008 law that guaranteed veterans a full-ride scholarship to any in-state, public university, or a similar cash amount to attend private colleges.

Purple Heart recipients forced to leave the service due to injury are eligible for benefits, as are dependents of service members who are killed in the line of duty. Veterans would get additional payments for completing science, technology and engineering courses, part of a broad effort to better prepare them for life after active-duty service amid a fast-changing job market. The law also restores benefits if a college closes mid-semester, a protection that was added after thousands of veterans were hurt by the collapse of for-profit college giant ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges.

“This is expanding our ability to support our veterans in getting education,” Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin told reporters at a briefing after Trump signed the measure at his New Jersey golf club following two nights at his home at New York’s Trump Tower.

Trump is staying at the New Jersey club on a working vacation. Journalists were not permitted to see the president sign the bill, as the White House has done for other veterans’ legislation he has turned into law. That includes a measure Trump signed at the club Saturday to provide nearly $4 billion in emergency funding for a temporary veterans health care program.

Wednesday’s signing came the day after Trump was rebuked for continuing to insist that “both sides” were culpable for an outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators. One woman was killed.

Also, two Virginia state troopers died in the crash of their helicopter. They were monitoring the rally. A wide range of veterans groups supported the education measure. The Veterans of Foreign Wars says hundreds of thousands stand to benefit.

Student Veterans of America says that only about half of the 200,000 service members who leave the military each year go on to enroll in college, while surveys indicate that veterans often outperform peers in the classroom.

The expanded educational benefits would be paid for by bringing living stipend payments under the GI Bill down to a similar level as that received by an active-duty member, whose payments were reduced in 2014 by 1 percent a year for five years. Total government spending on the GI Bill is expected to be more than $100 billion over 10 years.

Three men killed in shooting at Wisconsin drag raceway – Sheriff,"The victims, all men in their 20s or early 30s, were from Illinois (Source: Google Map) The victims, all men in their 20s or early 30s, were from Illinois (Source: Google Map)

Three people were shot dead at a drag race track in Wisconsin on Sunday, authorities said, but it was unclear who was responsible and what the motive might have been. The shooting took place at the Great Lakes Dragaway in Union Grove, Wisconsin, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told reporters at the track in news footage carried on the FOX6 News website.

Several thousand people were at the track at the time, which was evacuated. About 100 police officers responded to the shootings, interviewing witnesses, combing for evidence and helping with the investigation. No suspects were in custody, authorities said, and no motive had been determined. “We’re not aware of any danger to the community,” Beth said.

The victims, all men in their 20s or early 30s, were from Illinois. Their identities were not released. The men were standing near a food vendor when a gunman approached and shot them at what appeared to have been point-blank range, Beth told reporters. Two friends who were with the victims “had no idea what caused this,” he said. “We’re not aware of any altercations that might have happened earlier,” Beth said.

Wyndham Championship provides last chance for golfers’ playoff push,"It’s last-chance time on the PGA Tour. The field at the Wyndham Championship is once again littered with players trying to earn their way into golf’s postseason or earn full exemption on the tour for 2018.

When the tournament begins Thursday at par-70 Sedgefield Country Club, the focus _ as it is every year _ will be on those players on the bubble and those trying to improve their position for the playoffs.

“It’s a great opportunity to put myself in a better spot heading into next week’s playoffs,” Henrik Stenson said Wednesday.

Stenson, who won the FedEx Cup in 2013, arrived at Sedgefield with security for next week at No. 75 on the points list.

Others have some work to do.

The top 125 on the points list qualify for The Northern Trust next week in Old Westbury, New York, and also will be fully exempt on the tour next year, if they aren’t already.

Every player from No. 113 (Harris English) to No. 143 (Ricky Barnes) is in the Wyndham field. Among those directly on the bubble are No. 124 Daniel Summerhays, No. 125 Geoff Ogilvy and No. 126 Cameron Tringale.

“I guess that would consider me one of those bubble boys now,” said Sam Saunders, the grandson of Arnold Palmer who’s at No. 127.

Two players _ Kyle Stanley and Shawn Stefani _ cracked the top 125 here last year, and five did it in 2015.

“I need to play solid this week, but you know, my goal is not just to get into the FedEx Cup playoffs,” he added. “My goal is to try and win a golf tournament this week. If I don’t, and have a solid finish, that will take care of it as a byproduct. Can’t get too hung up on trying to move up a couple spots. But obviously, that is of the utmost importance this week.”

Some things to know about the PGA Tour’s final regular-season tournament:

FORMER CHAMPS: Only two of the past five winners of this tournament _ Davis Love III (2015) and Camilo Villegas (2014) _ are in this year’s field. Si Woo Kim, who tied the event’s 72-hole record with a 21-under 259 last year , is not here. In all, six of the eight players to win at Sedgefield since the tournament moved here in 2008 are playing, including local favorites Carl Pettersson (2008) and Webb Simpson (2011). Love, Simpson and Ryan Moore (2009) were placed in one threesome.

FAVORITE? The only player here ranked in the top 15 on the points list is No. 9 Kevin Kisner, who led or shared the lead after each of the first three rounds of last week’s PGA Championship in Charlotte before finishing in a tie for seventh place , four strokes behind winner Justin Thomas .

PALMER’S WALL: This is the first Wyndham Championship without Palmer, who had five top-10 finishes in 13 appearances at what was then called the Greater Greensboro Open. A plaque commemorating Palmer’s life and career was unveiled on the course’s Wall of Champions behind the green at No. 9. Palmer, who died in September, also played college golf at nearby Wake Forest.

“The fact that I get to come and play a PGA Tour event where he competed and played is really special,” Saunders said, “and really glad that he’ll have a permanent mark here.”

LOTS OF LOVE: Davis isn’t the only Love on the course this week. His son Dru, a former Alabama player in his first year on the tour, received a sponsor’s exemption .

Three CEOs resign from Trump council over Charlottesville,"Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich (twitter.com) Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich (twitter.com)

The chief executives of Intel Corp , Merck & Co Inc and Under Armour Inc resigned from U.S. President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council on Monday, following Trump’s initially tepid response to weekend violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. “I resigned from the council to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues…,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a blog post. (http://intel.ly/2fFOjAd). Kenneth Fraizer, the chief executive of drugmaker Merck and an African-American, said he left the advisory council because of the president’s reaction after the violence between white supremacists and counter protesters. Frazier cited the need to “take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”

The AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions that represent 12.5 million workers, said it was considering pulling its representative on the committee. After the white nationalist rally turned deadly on Saturday, Trump initially said that many sides were to blame. On Monday, in a statement, Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs, bowing to mounting political pressure as critics assailed him for not singling out white supremacists.

The CEO of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, announced his resignation from the council in a Twitter posting. “We remain resolute in our potential and ability to improve American manufacturing,” said Plank. “However, Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics.” Plank was criticized last winter by some of Under Armour’s biggest stars over his support of Trump, comments that basketball star Stephen Curry echoed.

The demonstration in Charlottesville by hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter protesters and killed one person. “America’s leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation. (http://bit.ly/2fFnITM)

“As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” he said. Trump responded shortly later in a tweet, saying, “Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”

Trump doubled down on his attack later in the day, tweeting that Merck “is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!” The son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker’s subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011.

He made his name as the company’s top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks. Many observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out $10 billion or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug’s withdrawal. But Frazier’s legal strategy led to a $4.85 billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines.

Merck shares closed up 0.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market. Frazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but making no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.

The political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign – but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump’s reaction.

The industry’s silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them. Individually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was “proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.”

Other top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville. “I support Ken Frazier’s decision. I’m thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,” said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: “Lincoln: ‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.’ Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.”

Richard Trumka, president of the largest federation of U.S. labor unions, the AFL-CIO, questioned the council’s effectiveness and said the group was mulling leaving. “The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,” Trumka said in a statement. Several executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.

Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council. Former Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies.

The White House said Sunday that Trump’s remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence – his first major domestic crisis as president – and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee. Trump on Saturday initially denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”

On Sunday, however, the White House added: “The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.”

Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari about wife Ashwiny Iyer: There is no competition at home,"Nitesh Tiwari explains why there is no competition between him and his wife Ashwiny Iyer. Nitesh Tiwari explains why there is no competition between him and his wife Ashwiny Iyer.

Filmmaker Nitesh Tiwary is proud of his director-wife Ashwiny Iyer but insists the duo have a very different working style where they don’t compete but help each other grow. Nitesh, who gave last year’s blockbuster Dangal, has penned Ashwiny’s latest Bareilley Ki Barfi.

“The trailers and songs have received good response, so as a writer I feel happy. As a husband, I feel very proud of what Ashwiny has achieved with the film. I hope people enjoy the film a lot,” Nitesh told reporters at a special screening of the film last night. The film marks Ashwiny’s second directorial outing after her critically-acclaimed Nil Battey Sannata.

Nitesh, who has previously helmed Bhoothnath and co-directed Chillar Party, said there is no competition between him and Ashwiny. “There is no competition. We have been working with each other since a long time so there is a clear understanding. We work on each other’s strengths and try to improve our weaknesses.

“She is a very different kind of director, my working style is different. As a husband and wife, we give each other constructive feedback and live our professional lives in our own way,” He added. The film, starting Rajkummar Rao, Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana, is scheduled to releases tomorrow.

Speaking about being referred to as Nitesh Tiwari’s wife, Ashwiny Iyer had earlier said in an interview to Indianexpress.com, “I don’t care and I don’t think he (Nitesh) also cares. We still belong to a male chauvinist society. If I go to a clinic, people ask me, ‘Miss or Mrs?’. I say, ‘Ashwini Iyer,’ because my passport has this name and Nitesh didn’t want me to change my name. So, at the clinic, they asked me, ‘What’s your husband’s name?’. I said, ‘Nitesh Tiwari.’ So, they said, ‘So, we will put Tiwari after your name.’ So, these things will always be there. That’s how we have been raised. In Aadhar card, you have the father’s name but not the mother’s name.”

She had added, “I was quite upset about it. Then I thought, why am I upset about this? They don’t even care if they need to have the mother’s name or not. But it is not that India is not changing. It is changing but some things that happened in the past haven’t changed.”

Charlottesville violence: Donald Trump lashes out at senator on controversial remarks,"President Donald Trump President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump lashed out at fellow Republican Lindsey Graham on Thursday after the South Carolina senator criticised his response to last weekend’s deadly violence in Charlottesville.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists…and people like Ms. Heyer,” Trump said on Twitter.

Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd protesting the far-right march. “Such a disgusting lie,” Trump continued. “He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!” Trump appeared to be referring to his defeat of Graham in last year’s presidential primary.

In an early morning flurry, Trump again sought to cast himself as a victim of unfair press coverage of his remarks. “The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!,” the US president added.

Graham had said the US president “took a step backward” Tuesday “by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally” and people like Heyer.

Clashes broke out between far-right demonstrators and counter-protesters in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville Saturday. Members of organised neo-Nazi and so-called “Alt-Right” groups had called a rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue there.

Both Democrat and Republican politicians criticised Trump’s initial response — when he condemned violence “on all sides” — as inadequate. After a press conference on Monday in which he singled out the Klu Klux and neo-Nazis as “repugant”, he appeared to move back to his previous position the following day. He once again said there had been “blame on both sides”, setting off a political firestorm.

As the crisis unfolded, senior business executives began dropping out of the White House economic advisory councils to the point that Trump on Wednesday announced he was scrapping them. World leaders have also criticized what they see as a lack of firmness on the issue that could open more space to the far-right in the United States.

Sweet shops to go on strike on August 21 to protest 5 per cent GST,"Sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST. Sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST.

Following the footsteps of the textile industry, sweet shops in Bengal are set to go on a strike on August 21, protesting against 5 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) being levied on sweets.Sweet shops owners maintained they are yet to implement the new tax regime and are still charging old rates from their customers. Moreover, they claimed that as the sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST.

The general secretary of Pachim Banga Mishtanna Vyavsaye Samiti — a state body of sweet traders — Rabin Pal, said: “Around 20 years ago, Chief Minister Jyoti Basu had lifted sales tax on sweets. About eight years ago, sweets were brought under ambit of VAT. After we protested, the government lifted VAT too. At present, there is no tax on sweets.”

“The government has not imposed GST on milk products like paneer. But as soon as you use paneer to make sweets, we have to pay GST. This is a problem because most sweets in Bengal are made of chhana. We will be on strike on August 21 and for the next two days, we will wait for the government’s stand. If there is no action from the government’s side, we will go for a three-day strike from August 24, which may also be a hunger strike,” he added.

According to shopowners, over 7,000 shops in Kolkata and about a lakh across Bengal will be on strike.

Not only sweets, shops selling snacks like kachori and samosas are too up in arms against the government.

“We have learnt that the government has imposed 12 per cent GST on such items. If we pay GST, what will we be left with?” asked Rajiv Desai, a roadside snacks and sweet seller.

“We have written several letters to the Centre. There is confusion over GST. The government has to understand the industry… it has levied 5 per cent GST on all sweets. We deal with highly perishable items, which has a lifeline of 12 to 18 hours. A large number of sweet sellers in Bengal are illiterate and don’t have the required infrastructure. How will they cope up with the new tax regime?” asked Jagannnath Ghosh, secretary (Kolkata unit) of Pachim Banga Mishthanno Vyavsaye Samiti.

"Might take time for people to get used to pink ball, says Moeen Ali ahead of Day-Night Test","Moeen Ali said that it might take time for people to get used to it, but it’s a great idea … if it helps bring the crowds in. (Source: Reuters) Moeen Ali said that it might take time for people to get used to it, but it’s a great idea … if it helps bring the crowds in. (Source: Reuters)

Moeen Ali, who was England’s man-of-the-series during their 3-1 Test series win at home against South Africa, is confident that it will take something more extraordinary than a pink ball to put him on the back foot when England takes on West Indies in the day/night Test.

During preparatory day-night County Championship fixtures, Ali bowled mere three overs and scored a fifty. He said at an event organised by one of the sponsors of the series: “It’s different… it feels lighter off the bat. Sometimes you don’t feel like you’ve hit it, and it goes; other times you’ve nailed it, and it doesn’t. But you get used to it … I did by the end of the (net) session.”

As for bowling with a pink ball, the 30 year old said, “The seam is good — it’s not quite as slippery. It spun, maybe because the seam is hard. Seeing it is fine. It will be interesting at twilight, but I will try not to think about it.”

The Dukes managing director Dilip Jadojia pointed out that these comments need to be taken with a pinch of salt. He said in an interview to Britain’s Press Association, “I ask for real evidence and at this moment there is no issue with the ball. Cricketers are nutters, and I know because I am one, but I’ve also been involved in making cricket balls for 45 years.

“The pink ball is not an alien thing. It’s just perception, opinion and psychology,” he insisted.

Ali, however, said, “It might take time for people to get used to it, but it’s a great idea … if it helps bring the crowds in.”

Beyond the lament,"At least 71 children have lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) At least 71 children have lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

Outrage is a natural reaction to the terrible tragedy that cruelly crushed the lives of many innocent children in Gorakhpur. However, outrage is a wasted emotion if it is not accompanied by honest introspection to identify all contributory causes and followed by a cluster of corrective actions.

The deaths of these children were caused by the cumulative effect of multiple failures of the public health system and skewed developmental processes that inflict innumerable injuries of economic and social inequity on the poor. Life-threatening illness is created by social conditions that make children vulnerable to the assault of infectious agents that thrive in insanitary conditions. When they reach the overcrowded hospital in a desperately ill condition, an uncaring system fails to provide the critical care they need. These causes are not listed on a death certificate but are indeed the unnamed assassins that routinely and remorselessly kill children in large numbers in the underdeveloped and poorly served regions of our country.

Why does eastern Uttar Pradesh have very high levels of infant mortality, low birth weight and stunting compared to the national average? Why is Gorakhpur ranked so low in comparative rankings of urban cleanliness? Why are both the medical college and a large hospital managed by the same doctor who also has to sign off on bills of payment? Why are government doctors allowed to run private clinics? Why is there no electronic inventory of drugs and essential supplies to permit real time monitoring and prevent unforeseen stock-outs? How transparent or opaque is the procurement process? Why were numerous complaints from the vendor unheeded? These questions call for review and reform of a system ridden with faults at multiple levels.

What erupted as a breaking media story on August 11 was only the acute manifestation of the chronic malady that ails our health system. It is not a one-off event that resulted from a callous cut-off of oxygen supply by a rogue supplier. Even that despicable act is now shrouded in conflicting claims of who is to blame and contestation of whether or not the interruption of oxygen supply was a cause of death. The underlying disease is always the recorded primary cause of death but lack of respiratory support in a critically ill state can decrease the chance of recovery and hasten death. It is a contributory cause, just as inexcusable as non-availability of blood for life-saving transfusion when a road trauma victim reaches a hospital. If we now deviously dispute whether oxygen is even essential for the intensive care of comatose children with encephalitis or severe pneumonia, we will fail to ensure that such stock-outs will not happen ever again.

We do, however, need to look beyond the oxygen story. Early marriage and motherhood of an undernourished adolescent, leading to a low birth weight baby that suffers further malnutrition and falls easy prey to infections — this is the tale that plays out as the backdrop for sick children in hospitals in Gorakhpur and neighbouring districts. As mosquitos breed in paddy fields and pigs gorge on garbage piles near human dwellings, conditions are ripe for animal to human transmission of viruses through insect vectors. Bacteria, too, abound in unhygienic surroundings and easily invade the ill-nourished bodies of poor children. It requires an all-round development effort to alleviate poverty, ameliorate child nutrition and obliterate squalor. Even as we do this, we need to fix our dysfunctional health system.

Our disease surveillance system needs to be strengthened in both community and hospital settings, to provide reliable real-time data. Given the rising threat of zoonotic diseases that spread from animal to humans, eco-surveillance systems need to be developed for integrating data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations. Immunisation for vaccine preventable diseases, as recommended by the public health authorities, must be effectively delivered by the health workers after gaining community acceptance through culturally sensitive vaccine literacy programmes. The primary healthcare system must be well resourced and adequately staffed, to be capable of early detection and care, appropriate referral for advanced care when needed, and post-recovery counselling and follow-up. Fully functioning health and wellness sub-centres and primary health centres must speedily spring and serve close to the communities rather than rest and rust as undelivered plans in the proposals of health programmes. In cases with disabling sequelae, as in severe encephalitis, rehabilitation services too need to be accessible and efficient.

At the level of the district and medical college hospitals, where advanced care is provided, standard management protocols for clinical care and standard operating procedures for administrative processes are essential for ensuring timely, appropriate and empathetic care. Implementation of a programme of universal health coverage will also make it affordable. Transparent and dependable procurement systems, developed first in Tamil Nadu, will ensure uninterrupted availability of essential drugs and other supplies. Government doctors must be well paid but barred from private practice. Clinical competence must be supported by public health and management expertise.

Periodic quality audits must encompass technical, administrative and social audits. To make this happen, we need to invest in training and deploying professionals in public health management at different levels of the system. Based on a core combination of public health expertise and management skills, further specialisation can be customised for public health programme management and hospital management. While the National Health Policy of 2017 calls for the establishment of public health management cadres in every state, the need was never before as evident as now.

The children of Gorakhpur would not have died in vain if we can put aside political bickering and unitedly resolve to salvage and strengthen our sinking health system.

The period of expenditure covers a financial year (FY) 2015-16, 2016-17 and April to June 2017 (current FY). According to the break-up provided, former IPS officer and current acting secretary Amitabh, who hails from Ranchi, collected a whopping Rs 65 lakh on air tickets (exact figure

Rs 65,04,124) and Rs 42.25 lakh as TA/DA from the BCCI.

Add to it, Amitabh also received Rs 29 lakh (exact Rs 29,54,068) in foreign exchanges as and when he represented BCCI at international forums.

His expenses for stay (hotel or otherwise) have been Rs 13.51 lakh (Rs 13,51,061) while office expenses have been Rs 3.93 lakh. He also received an additional Rs 1.31 lakh (Rs 1,31,421).

The total amount for the two financial years and the current year (till June) amounts to Rs 1,56,01,993 (Rs 1.56 crore approximately). However treasurer Aniruddh, known to be former BCCI president N Srinivasan confidante, has beaten the secretary hands down in terms of expenditure from board’s coffers.

The treasurer’s air ticket bills during the aforementioned period is Rs 60,29 lakh (Rs 60,29,210) and TA/DA is a whopping Rs 75 lakh (Rs 75, 07,553). The BCCI paid Aniruddh Rs 17.64 lakh (Rs 17,64,966) in foreign exchange while stay charges (accommodation) were Rs 11 lakh (approximately) (Rs 11,03,893).

Under the head, ‘Other Expenses’, Aniruddh has sanctioned Rs 3.41 lakh (Rs 3,41,603) with Rs 2.37 lakh earmarked for telephone expenses. In all, he spent Rs 1,71,58,330 (Rs 1.71 crore).

Some of the other office-bearers like former president Anurag Thakur or current acting president CK Khanna have spent significantly less during the same period.

Thakur’s total expenditure before his ouster was Rs 24 lakh (Rs 24,01, 617) while Khanna during this phase has spent Rs 6.52 lakh (Rs 6,52,084).

RBI still has room to slash key rate in current fiscal: Naina Lal Kidwai,"The country’s banking sector is saddled with NPAs worth over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore alone are with public sector banks. The country’s banking sector is saddled with NPAs worth over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore alone are with public sector banks.

The Reserve Bank of India still has room to cut the key policy rate in the current fiscal, veteran banker Naina Lal Kidwai has said, while stressing that banks should pass on the benefits of lower rates to customers. RBI reduced the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent earlier this month, citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.

“There is clearly room for further rate cuts. But the rate cut from RBI is not good enough. The rate cut has to happen from the way banks engage with industry, and that is a function on how efficient the banks are, what are their NPAs, their losses,” Kidwai told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in the capital. She further said the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans, going forward, will be a “big positive”.

“Now moving forward with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, with industries’ own performance improving, there should be better resolution of the NPAs and they (banks) should be able to get the NPAs off their books,” said Kidwai, who has served as the Country Head of HSBC India, was also president of industry body Ficci. She said she expects NPAs in the banking sector to come down slowly.

The country’s banking sector is saddled with NPAs worth over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore alone are with public sector banks.

"China tells US, North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on threats","Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford speaks with a Chinese official before boarding his plane at Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China, Wednesday, August 16, 2017, to travel to Shenyang, China to observe a Chinese Military Exercise.

China is telling the US and North Korea to “hit the brakes” on threatening words and actions and work toward a peaceful resolution of their dispute, in a sign of growing concern over the standoff on the part of Pyongyang’s only major ally. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to “stir up an incident on their doorstep,” according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.

“The most important task at hand is for the US and North Korea to `hit the brakes’ on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an ‘August crisis’,” Wang was quoted as saying in the Tuesday conversation. The ministry quoted Lavrov as saying tensions could rise again with the U.S. and South Korea set to launch large-scale military exercises on Aug. 21.

“A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula’s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods,” Lavrov was quoted as saying. China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer, although relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated amid the North’s continuing defiance of China’s calls for restraint. In recent months, China has joined with Russia in calling for the US to suspend annual military exercises with South Korea in exchange for Pyongyang halting its missile and nuclear tests as a first step toward direct talks.

On Wednesday, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, continued a visit to China following talks the day before with his Chinese counterpart that touched on North Korea. No details of the talks have been released. Dunford on Tuesday told Fang Fenghui, chief of the People’s Liberation Army’s joint staff department, that the sides had “many difficult issues” between them but were willing to deal with them through dialogue.

On Monday, Dunford was in Seoul to meet with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media, seeking to ease anxiety while showing his willingness to back President Donald Trump’s warnings if need be. The US wants to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea, but Washington is also ready to use the “full range” of its military capabilities, Dunford said. His visit to Asia, which also will include a stop in Japan, comes after Trump last week declared the US military “locked and loaded” and said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.

North Korea’s military on Tuesday presented leader Kim Jong Un with plans to launch missiles into waters near the US territory of Guam and “wring the windpipes of the Yankees,” even as both Koreas and the United States signaled their willingness to avert a deepening crisis, with each suggesting a path toward negotiations.

The tentative interest in diplomacy follows unusually combative threats between Trump and North Korea amid worries Pyongyang is nearing its long-sought goal of being able to send a nuclear missile to the US mainland. Next week’s start of US-South Korean military exercises that enrage the North each year could make diplomacy even more difficult.

During an inspection of the North Korean army’s Strategic Forces, which handles the missile program, Kim praised the military for drawing up a “close and careful plan” and said he would watch the “foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees” a little more before deciding whether to order the missile test, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. Kim appeared in photos sitting at a table with a large map marked by a straight line between what appeared to be northeastern North Korea and Guam, and passing over Japan apparently showing the missiles’ flight route.

The missile plans were previously announced. Kim said North Korea would conduct the launches if the “Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity,” warning the United States to “think reasonably and judge properly” to avoid shaming itself, the news agency said.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Tuesday,”We continue to be interested in trying to find a way to get to dialogue, but that’s up to (Kim).” Lobbing missiles toward Guam, a major US military hub in the Pacific, would be deeply provocative from the U.S. perspective. A miscalculation on either side could lead to military confrontation.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, meanwhile, a liberal who favors diplomacy, urged North Korea to stop provocations and to commit to talks over its nuclear weapons program. Moon, in a televised speech Tuesday on the anniversary of World War II’s end and the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule, said Seoul and Washington agree that the nuclear standoff should “absolutely be solved peacefully.” He said no US military action on the Korean Peninsula could be taken without Seoul’s consent.

North Korea’s military said last week that it would finalize the plan to fire four ballistic missiles near Guam, which is about 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) from Pyongyang. It would be a test of the Hwasong-12, a new missile the country flight-tested for the first time in May. The liquid-fuel missile is designed to be fired from road mobile launchers and has been described by North Korea as built for attacking Alaska and Hawaii.

"I think Virat Kohli has a lot of Australian spirit in him, says Michael Clarke","Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP) Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP)

Former Australian captain Michael Clarke believes that Indian captain skipper Virat Kohli is often misunderstood for his on-field reactions. Stating that he has enormous respect for the Indian skipper Clarke also revealed that Kohli has quite a fans in Australia as well.

Addressing the media, Clarke said, “I disagree that Virat doesn’t have too many fans in Australia. I think Virat has a lot of Australian spirit in him” and added, “To be honest, he plays the game really tough and is really competitive on the field, but he is a nice guy off the field. So when people get to know Virat, they realize that what they see on the field is just his competitive spirit. I can’t think of any Australian cricketer who wasn’t like that every time we walked out on the field. I certainly think there is respect for Virat in Australia.”

Speaking on how the Australian media views him, Clarke said, “You probably are not going to read the positive stuff (about Virat) in the Australian media though. They all want to write a negative story. But I have a great relationship with him and I think he is respectful.”

Meanwhile, with the end of pay dispute controversy, Clarke believes that the focus is now on cricket. Expressing delight, he said, “It is fantastic that the deal has been done and everybody can focus on cricket. Australia will be traveling to Bangladesh very soon and then we come to India and then the Ashes, so it is wonderful that the game can now move forward. The players can focus on what they do the best – playing – and the administrators can do their job too. I think everybody is sick and tired of talking about it and very happy that it’s over.”

However, Clarke refrained from taking any sides and said, “I don’t need to take sides. There have been compromises from both the parties, but now I am glad the focus is back on cricket.”

Hong Kong activist arrested over allegation of stapled legs,"Lam said that on Thursday, unknown Mandarin-speaking men abducted him from a busy street in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong and rendered him unconscious. He said they beat him and warned him not to follow through on his plan. Lam said that on Thursday, unknown Mandarin-speaking men abducted him from a busy street in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong and rendered him unconscious. He said they beat him and warned him not to follow through on his plan.

The strange case of a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist who claimed mainland Chinese agents stapled his legs as a warning has taken another twist after police arrested him Tuesday on suspicion of providing false information.

Howard Lam made waves last week with his eye-catching allegations, which rekindled fears about Beijing interfering in Hong Kong despite promising it considerable autonomy since the 1997 handover from Britain. But police said his story didn’t check out.

“The victim’s reports about his activities on that day and the investigation’s results do not match,” police said in a statement, “At this time, there’s no evidence that anyone was illegally detained in Hong Kong.”

Lam, 42, had intended to send a signed photo of Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi to Liu Xia, the widow of late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, and posted his plans on Facebook. He said he received a call early last week from an acquaintance on the mainland warning him not to send the photo.

Lam said that on Thursday, unknown Mandarin-speaking men abducted him from a busy street in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong and rendered him unconscious. He said they beat him and warned him not to follow through on his plan.

He said they also stapled Xs into his thighs because he is Christian. He displayed his wounds to reporters at a news conference Friday, flanked by fellow members of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, before filing a police report and going to a hospital.

Police said Tuesday that they arrested Lam on suspicion of providing false information to mislead police after looked into his allegations, including checking surveillance footage from cameras in the area.

Democratic Party Chairman Wu Chi-wai said party leaders decided to air Lam’s allegations in public instead of going to police right away because they feared for his personal safety.

He said Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy party would provide a full account after the police conclude their investigation.

“We hope the truth will come to light as soon as possible,” Wu told reporters.

Lam’s case stirred concerns that Beijing is tightening its hold on Hong Kong, following other recent cases including the secret detention of a group of Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese-Canadian tycoon whose whereabouts are unknown. In both cases, mainland security agents are suspected of taking them across the border, in violation of Hong Kong’s constitution.

Indian Grand Master Harika Dronavalli defeated Rauf Mamedov from Azerbaijan for her second win of the Master’s Tournament at the Abu Dhabi

International Chess Festival in Abu Dhabi.

The world number nine Indian, playing with white pieces, started off on an aggressive note which led the third seeded Azerbaijani to commit mistakes early into the game.

She did not take the foot off the pedal as the game progressed and found the winning move after a long and gruelling 56 move game. “I did not try anything new. I just played a setup which I had practised long ago, through which my opponent made two mistakes in the initial stages of the game which gave me the edge and I kept pressure throughout the game and slowly my opponent’s position collapsed,” said Harika.

The lass from Guntur is paired up against Grand Master Stupak Kirill from Belarus for her third-round clash. Harika will look to keep the momentum going but will be wary of her opponent as she will be playing him for the very first time on Thursday.

“It is satisfying that I beat the third seed of the tournament but I still have seven more games to go and will focus on that,” added the Indian.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan completes 20 years in Bollywood: From a teenager to a leading star,"At the age of 24, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan made her debut in Bollywood with Aur Pyar Ho Gaya opposite Bobby Deol in 1997. And, it has been 20 years since the release of her first Hindi film. Even though she has several flops to her credit, Aishwarya seemed to be unfazed with failure and chose some challenging roles over the years. Be it Sarabjit's Dalbir Kaur or Raincoat's Neerja.

The young actor appeared naive in Aur Pyar Hogaya. She was every girl in their early 20s - confused, bubbly, immature and impatient. But just like her off-screen aura, her on-screen presence too matured with time. Her Tamil film Jeans is still fresh in our memories, not only because of how pretty she looked but how she took the risk of appearing in a double role.

Eventually, as she kept doing films one after another, she turned into an epitome of grace, beauty and humility. Her blue eyes left everyone star struck, no matter who it was.

The actor is married to Abhishek Bachchan. The duo have starred in films like Guru, Dhai Akshar Prem Ke and Kuch Na Kaho. In fact, Aishwarya even made an appearance as a bar dancer in the song Kajra Re from Abhishek Bachchan's Bunty Babli.

In 2011, Aishwarya was blessed with a daughter Aradhya. While Ash used to be fearless yet thoughtful about the choices in her career, now she has become choosy about the kind of films she wants to do."
Judy Murray tells of long battle to tennis success,"Judy would raise money for equipment, coaching and tournaments by organising fund raisers at her local tennis club in Dunblane, attracting youngsters by making sure it was fun. (Source: Reuters) Judy would raise money for equipment, coaching and tournaments by organising fund raisers at her local tennis club in Dunblane, attracting youngsters by making sure it was fun. (Source: Reuters)

Scottish coach Judy Murray, a driving force in British tennis and mother of world number one Andy and Wimbledon mixed doubles champion Jamie, has shaped the two most successful players Britain has produced in decades.

But the road to success has been a hard trek from a remote rainswept town in which the Murray matriarch struggled to juggle childcare responsibilities with that of scraping together pennies to nurture her sons’ promising tennis careers.

Add in the ingrained sexism and belittlement she faced from Britain’s sporting establishment, the challenges could be never ending.

Her goal was to find a way to fulfil her sons’ potential, rather than tournament success.

“It was always more about say ‘they’re good 10 year-olds, let’s see what they can do next’,” the 57-year-old told Reuters in an interview.

Judy, the winner of 64 Scottish tennis titles and Britain’s former Fed Cup captain, coached both her sons until they were about 11 and 12 on a shoestring budget.

Those humble beginnings have served her sons well as Andy has captured three grand slam trophies and two Olympic gold medals, while Jamie, a year older, has won a number of major men’s and mixed doubles titles.

Their mother learned to teach and motivate children on the ground, providing coaching she feels was previously lacking in British tennis, especially for girls.

“When I was learning how to coach there was no manual and no one to tell you how to do it,” she said.

Mostly she taught using creative play, tapping into her sons’ love of all sport from before they could walk.

As for tennis: “Their first court was two chairs and a piece of rope in the driveway,” she writes in her memoir, “Knowing the Score”, which has just been published.

Judy would raise money for equipment, coaching and tournaments by organising fund raisers at her local tennis club in Dunblane, attracting youngsters by making sure it was fun.

“YOU WOULD SAY THAT, JUDY”

When her charges started to win, she continued to face persistent belittlement and received the cold shoulder from her peers.

Even when Andy won the 2004 U.S. Open junior title, she was refused funding help by the Scottish Institute of Sport performance director who told her they were “not interested in junior grand slam champions.”

The attitude from sports’ authorities when she tried to get backing to develop facilities and players was “a sense of ‘well, you would say that, Judy'”.

“We were still skint, still trying to persuade governing bodies that a kid from Scotland could be a proper tennis champion, and I was still battling the perception that I was not much more than a really pushy mum,” added Judy.

The chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association once said to her: “Goodness, you’re taking this all a bit seriously, aren’t you?”

She describes dozens of battles with tennis authorities, who she says have yet to ask about her role in the Murray brothers’ careers.

“I do have 25 years of coaching experience from starting as a volunteer mum to the top of the women’s and men’s game and every single step in between,” she said, describing her work around the country to promote junior tennis and train coaches.

“Nobody has come to me and said to me “What do you need and how can we help you to do it again — not that I would want to,” she said, calling for investment in more indoor facilities to open the game up to young and less privileged players.

“But I can share that with anyone who wants to learn.”

Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier, Wang Yang, on Wednesday pledged full support to Nepal for the development and promotion of Ayurvedic medical system in the Himalayan nation which is rich in medicinal plants and herbs. Yang, who visited the National Ayurveda Research and Training Center situated in Kirtipur near Kathmandu assured to cooperate with Nepal to carry out further research in the sector of Ayurveda.

Health Secretary Kiran Regmi said the government was seeking to establish an Ayurveda Hospital in all seven provinces across the country in future, asking the Chinese side for help.

“Though Nepal is rich in medicinal plants and herbs, lack of skills and knowledge about their proper use has deprived Nepalis of reaping maximum benefits,” Regmi said, adding that the government was establishing herbs processing center equipped with high technology and a digital library for the promotion of Ayurveda.

The government of China had constructed a building for the center at a cost of Rs 680 million in 2009 and handed it to the Nepal Government in 2011.

Besides, the Chinese government also gifted medical equipments worth Rs 240 million. Surgery, gynaecology, maternity, cancer treatment, acupuncture, radiology and pathology services are available in the center.

Fears of violence overshadowing Bundesliga restart,"The latest incidents occurred on Monday, when Hertha Berlin’s game at Hansa Rostock was twice held up. (Source: AP) The latest incidents occurred on Monday, when Hertha Berlin’s game at Hansa Rostock was twice held up. (Source: AP)

Fan trouble and the threat of violence are overshadowing Friday’s start to the Bundesliga. Defending champion Bayern Munich hosts Bayer Leverkusen to get the league underway, but unsavoury scenes in the German Cup and the threat of more to come have dominated headlines in the build-up.

“I have become very concerned in the last weeks and months that there were martial marches in the context of football games, `war declarations’ and inhuman actions against teams and their fans,” German soccer federation president Reinhard Grindel said Wednesday. “Football can’t stand for that. It has to stop.”

The latest incidents occurred on Monday, when Hertha Berlin’s game at Hansa Rostock was twice held up. First, Hertha fans lit flares and fireworks in their corner. Later, the match was stopped for a much longer suspension when Rostock fans taunted their rivals with a Hertha banner stolen from a previous game.

They set it alight as fireworks flew in both directions. Some landed on the field, and referee Robert Hartmann led the players off as fires broke out amid unoccupied seats with riot police lined up alongside.

The police were unable to intervene because of a fence separating them from the masked fans, who continued taunting their rivals as others joined in derogatory chants. The game was not abandoned but resumed more than a quarter of an hour later to the sound of explosions.

“That will occupy everyone in the coming days and weeks – federations, clubs, fans. It absolutely cannot go on like this,” Hertha general manager Michael Preetz said.

Officials were helpless to prevent the trouble despite it being labelled a high-risk game. “When you see that there were 1,700 police and more than 300 wardens here, that sniffer dogs and high-definition cameras are in operation. Everything that can be done to keep order was done,” Rostock chairman Robert Marien said. “It can only be solved by society as a whole.”

Rostock police chief Michael Ebert said it was likely club officials had facilitated the stolen banner’s entry into the stadium, a charge rejected by Marien.

Potential trouble was averted in Berlin earlier Monday when police detained 91 Dynamo Berlin fans before their side’s game against Schalke. They had received information that rival fans had pre-arranged a fight. The police, who found balaclavas and expandable batons among the fans, released the detainees after the game.

Some ultra groups previously displayed banners calling for “war” against the German federation in response to a general clampdown on pyrotechnics at games.

Despite being banned, pyrotechnics featured prominently at many games last season, including the German Cup final between Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt. Security had been heightened for that game, but still, fans managed to smuggle in their flares and fireworks.

Federation general secretary Friedrich Curtius said this showed “the high criminal energy” of some fan groups. Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann has called for clubs to distance themselves from the ultra fan groups.

“The statements that I’ve been made aware of from the ultra scene in the last days are really totally unacceptable,” Herrmann told TV station Sat. 1.

Other politicians have echoed his call for tougher sanctions and zero-tolerance for violence, as have club officials. “We’re on the wrong path when we’re talking about a war-scenario in connection with football,” Preetz said. “We have to have a factual discussion. That will be hard enough in the next weeks.”

Grindel called Wednesday for a change in how the federation deals with infringements, to refrain from collective punishments such as fines for clubs and partial stadium closures – these were the standard responses before.

“We have to build trust through dialogue,” said Grindel, who said the federation very much welcomed talks with ultras in Dresden. “We want to find common ways to achieve transparent and fair measures to ensure a positive stadium experience.”

Grindel referred to the positive sides of German soccer culture – the impressive choreographies, secondary events outside stadiums, campaigns for tolerance, low ticket prices, the great atmosphere at games – but said clear lines have to be drawn, including the “the renouncement of violence.”

“It’s time for a rethink,” Grindel said.

"Priests should report abuse confessions, recommend Australian investigative authority","Clergy who find out about sexual abuse during a religious confession would not be exempt from the law. (Representational image) Clergy who find out about sexual abuse during a religious confession would not be exempt from the law. (Representational image)

Priests who fail to tell police about suspected child sexual abuse should face criminal charges, even when they learn of abuse during a confidential religious confession, Australia’s most powerful investigative authority recommended today. Australia’s Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the nation’s highest form of inquiry recommended that all states and territories in Australia introduce legislation that would make it a criminal offense for people to fail to report child sexual abuse in an institutional setting.

Clergy who find out about sexual abuse during a religious confession would not be exempt from the law. “The right to practice one’s religious beliefs must accommodate civil society’s obligation to provide for the safety of all and, in particular, children’s safety from sexual abuse,” the commission wrote in a report released Monday. “Institutions directed to caring for and providing services for children, including religious institutions, must provide an environment where children are safe from sexual abuse. Reporting information relevant to child sexual abuse to the police is critical to ensuring the safety of children.”

Current laws on reporting knowledge of crimes vary across Australia. In some jurisdictions, information received during religious confessions which are considered highly confidential by churches is considered privileged, and thus exempt from mandatory reporting requirements. The royal commission has been investigating since 2013 how churches and other institutions responded to the sexual abuse of children in Australia over the last several decades. The reporting requirement it urged Australia to adopt was one of 85 recommendations it made in a report aimed at revamping the criminal justice system to ensure fairer treatment of victims of child sexual abuse.

The reporting mandate would apply to people who failed to tell police that they knew, suspected or even should have suspected that an adult associated with their institution was sexually abusing a child. If such a law was actually imposed in Australia, priests would ostensibly have to choose between following criminal law or canon law, which forbids them from revealing anything they hear during confession. In its report, the commission acknowledged the significance placed upon the confidentiality of religious confessions, particularly by the Catholic Church. But the commission also said it had learned of cases in which abusers had confessed to clergy that they had sexually assaulted children and then went on to re offend, before seeking forgiveness yet again.

But if privacy and security of identity is what is keeping you from considering this, then the resort has that taken care of too.

The resort assures that they prioritise your safety and privacy as long as you stay there and guarantee “absolute discretion” of the details of your trip at the resort.

The packages that one can avail at the resort ranges from Overnight Package to Gold Package. For $599, a deluxe room, airport transportation, bilingual host and “1 Girl Overnight” are the amenities that you can avail under the Overnight Package and for $1499, you can avail services like “2 Girls 24 hours, executive villa, all meals, 1 spa pass” among others under the Gold Package.

Prostitution is known to be legal in Colombia, under the condition that it is carried out in designated “tolerance zones”. Reasons like poverty and displacement due to financial restraints have resulted in prostitution becoming widespread and rampant in the country.

We think it’s bizarre, but probably at a time when people are in a rush to make flourishing careers leave them with no time to nourish relationships, could this be what many would rather opt for? Let us know what you think in the comments’ section below.

Colombia striker Carlos Bacca joined Spanish club Villarreal on loan from AC Milan on Wednesday. Villarreal said the one-season loan agreement includes the option to buy the player at the end of the season.

Bacca returns to a Spanish league where the 30-year-old forward flourished in two seasons at Sevilla before joining Milan in 2015

Bacca has made 39 appearances for Colombia, scoring 13 goals. According to Villarreal, he has scored 165 career goals in 336 matches. He scored 14 goals for Milan last season.

Elsewhere in Spain, Las Palmas announced that Kevin-Prince Boateng was leaving the club after both sides agreed to end his contract two days before its season opener.

Las Palmas said that Boateng was leaving due to “personal reasons of an irreversible nature.” The club thanked the former AC Milan standout for his “professionalism” that he displayed during his single season on the Canary Islands. He scored 10 goals for the club last campaign.

Boateng said he was leaving “because I miss my family.”

“It’s not a decision based on sports,” he told a news conference. “For a father it is very difficult to be so far from one’s child and wife. Family comes first.”

Las Palmas opens the Spanish league season on Friday at Valencia.

Southampton chairman shuts door on Virgil Van Dijk departure,"Southampton, Ralph Krueger, Virgil van Dijk, Premier League, sports news, football, Indian Express. (Source: AP) Southampton, Ralph Krueger, Virgil van Dijk, Premier League, sports news, football, Indian Express. (Source: AP)

Southampton’s recent takeover has not altered the Premier League club’s strategy of trying to hold on to their best players, chairman Ralph Krueger has said, while reiterating that defender Virgil van Dijk will not be sold in this window.

Chinese businessman Jisheng Gao purchased an 80 percent stake in the club for around 210 million pounds ($271 million) this week and Krueger said the sale would not have any immediate impact on the club’s business strategy.

“This partnership gives us an opportunity to move differently into the global arena,” the chairman told local newspaper the Southern Daily Echo.

“Great football teams are not built by permanent change. They are built by holding groups together, by building on it.”

Dutch international Van Dijk has been forced to train on his own after putting in a transfer request amid interest from Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City, but Krueger said Southampton were still hopeful of reintegrating him.

“Nobody is for sale that we don’t want to sell and so he is not for sale in this window. We have said it more than once,” he added.

Southampton have lost a large number of players to their domestic rivals in the past few seasons, but Krueger said he was keen to end the perception that they were a selling club.

“We thought this was a good summer for that,” he added. “This is a group that (has) tasted winning and keeping them together would give us the chance to reach another level. “Virgil is not the only player that is involved in this. He is part of the whole strategy of not selling.”

Algeria recalls veteran crisis manager Ahmed Ouyahia as Prime Minister,"A veteran politician and diplomat by training, Ouyahia first became prime minister in the mid-1990s, when Algeria was fighting to suppress an Islamist insurgency.

Algeria’s presidency has recalled veteran crisis manager Ahmed Ouyahia as prime minister, a job he first held in the 1990s when Algeria was battling an Islamist insurgency. Ouyahia, 65, will replace Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who held the job for just three months, the office of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said on Tuesday. Ouyahia will likely be seen as a steadying influence as Algeria tries to carry out economic adjustments to cope with a fall in oil prices that has slashed state revenues. The presidency statement gave no reason for the change. Ouyahia has served three terms as prime minister and most recently was Bouteflika’s chief of staff.

A veteran politician and diplomat by training, Ouyahia first became prime minister in the mid-1990s, when Algeria was fighting to suppress an Islamist insurgency. He is also leader of the National Rally for Democracy, a party close to the presidency that increased its number of seats in May’s parliamentary election. “Ouyahia is a renowned servant of the state who has the experience to manage situations of crisis,” said Arslan Chikhaoui, an Algiers-based analyst who runs a private consultancy firm. The North African state’s political system is often opaque, and Bouteflika, 80, has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. Under the constitution, the president appoints the prime minister. Political jostling around Bouteflika has intensified as his health has waned, fuelling questions about the shape of any transition if he steps down before his term ends in 2019. Moves to reduce subsidies and imports and diversify Algeria’s oil-dependent economy have created political divisions over how far to push reforms.

As prime minister Tebboune was leading the austerity drive, and had also spoken out about the need to separate money from politics. In the run up to Tebboune’s dismissal, there was media speculation that he had fallen out of favour because of differences with Ali Haddad, a prominent businessman close to the presidency.

Tebboune was also perceived to be encroaching on foreign policy, seen as a preserve of the presidency, after he held a meeting with French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe earlier this month, said one senior source who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. “My loyalty to the president remains complete,” Tebboune said after his dismissal.

Mumbai doctor comes up with innovation to aid C-section; many steer clear,"He worked as a professor of gynecology in Sion hospital when the Salem steel ring retractor had been designed. (Representational Image) He worked as a professor of gynecology in Sion hospital when the Salem steel ring retractor had been designed. (Representational Image)

A technique fashioned by a city gynaecologist in a government hospital that can single-handedly conduct a Cesarean delivery is an innovation which is being passed onto medical students. But the technique reserved for only emergency situations has not been adopted by many doctors.

The “crude” innovation involves a Salem steel ring with clips to hold abdominal layers wide open while a doctor delivers a baby in situations where there are no staff members to assist the surgery.

“Necessity is the mother of invention. Routine strikes by hospital staff prompted me to get the ring made,” says Dr Ganesh Shinde who got the clips attached to a Salem steel ring in a Goregaon iron workshop in 2002 during a doctors’ strike.

He worked as a professor of gynecology in Sion hospital when the Salem steel ring retractor had been designed.

“When resident doctors go on strike, the workload shifts to all senior doctors. We saw situations where a Cesarean had to be conducted urgently and there was no staff to help,” Shinde said. Generally, assistants hold the ring and a surgeon operates.

Since 2002, he has used the device over a dozen times to conduct Cesarean surgeries alone. Now, a dean at Dr RN Cooper hospital, Shinde teaches his batch about the application of a retractor, although he does not advise his students to use the technique alone.

“There are ethical issues involved in using such untested innovations. But I use it only during emergencies when saving a life is more important,” he said. The technique, however, is not popular with other doctors in city.

“Usually, someone who is assisting in a delivery puts the retractor. The instrument must be a replacement for an assistant. But an assistant is needed not only for retraction but also to avert other emergencies like blood loss or other complications,” said Dr P Trivedi, the former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) and a gynaecologist with Rajawadi hospital.

According to him, such techniques may be used in rural areas where there is less man power. But they must only be used in the presence of trained staff members. The technique is discussed in classes and as part of a thesis in medical colleges under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Shinde said.

“Any instrument that comes with innovation, which is not certified, is a subjective choice for a gynaecologist. Some techniques get popular. But we prefer a nurse to an instrument for safety reasons,” said gynaecologist Dr Sangeeta Pikale adding that doctors keep coming up with innovations that help ease the process during routine surgeries.

Supreme Court questions Gujarat decision to reappoint N K Amin,"Supreme Court (Files) Supreme Court (Files)

The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the Gujarat government’s decision to re-induct IPS officer N K Amin as Superintendent of Police after his retirement, observing he had serious charges against him and had spent eight years in jail.

Giving the state government a day’s time to take a final decision, a bench of Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud said, “Either you take a call by tomorrow or we will deal with the issue. There were two serious allegations against him and in one case he has been in jail for eight years.”

The court was hearing a PIL filed by retired IPS officer Rahul Sharma challenging the appointments of Amin and Tarun Barot (retired) as Tapi SP and DSP (Railways), respectively.

The court also referred to the case of former Gujarat DGP P P Pandey, who was given a promotion and three-month extension despite being out on bail in the Ishrat Jahan case. Pandey had offered to quit after the court’s observations.

Appearing for Gujarat, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta backed Amin’s re-induction, saying he had been in jail for eight years for different reasons but refused to elaborate.

“I don’t want to elaborate but he has been in jail for eight years for different reasons. He has contributed immensely towards safety and security of public,” Mehta said.

Mehta said Sharma’s petition was motivated by his differences with the state government.

The apex court had earlier sought the state government’s response on the petition, which alleged that Amin faced trial in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Ishrat Jahan fake encounter, while Barot was accused in the Sadiq Jaman and Ishrat Jahan cases.

Amin was, however, acquitted in the Sohrabuddin encounter case.

Barcelona’s Luis Suarez out for four weeks,"Barcelona’s Luis Suarez in action with Real Madrid’s Marcelo. (Source: Reuters) Barcelona’s Luis Suarez in action with Real Madrid’s Marcelo. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona’s Luis Suarez will not be available to play for the Catalans for four weeks while Gerard Pique remains in doubt for the first league game against Betis due to groin pain.

The Uruguayan International picked up the injury during the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup at Santiago Bernabeu against rivals Real Madrid on Wednesday. Tests on Suarez confirmed that he has a distension in the posterior articular capsule in his right knee.

He is now set to miss starting games of the La Liga season against Betis, Alaves, Espanyol and a possible trip to Getafe. Tests on Pique confirmed that the defender has groin strain and his availability for the match against Betis will depend on recovery.

Ernesto Valverde’s men went down with an aggregate of 5-1 against Champions League and La Liga winners Real Madrid to lose out on Spanish Super Cup. After the match, Pique said that he felt inferior to Madrid for the first time in his nine year career span with Barca. “The season is very long and there is room for improvement,” Pique said. “But in nine years at Barcelona this is the first time that I have felt we are inferior to Madrid.”

“It is true that they won the Champions League last year, but we came here and won not long before that. We are not in the best moment, as a team or a club. This a long process and there is room for improvement, We must stay as close as possible and keep moving forwards.”

“It is important for us to live with the defeat and accept that Madrid were better,” Pique added.

Violence prompts US Congress to discuss militant threats,"A vehicle drives into a group of protesters demonstrating against a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: AP) A vehicle drives into a group of protesters demonstrating against a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: AP)

A US congressional panel next month will hold a hearing on violent extremism, including threats from domestic militants, following a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly. The chairman of the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, Republican Michael McCaul, announced the Sept. 12 hearing in a letter to the panel’s top Democrat, Bennie Thompson.

The committee holds a hearing once a year, around the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, to discuss worldwide threats.

A committee aide said the Charlottesville protests had prompted the decision to broaden the hearing to include threats from domestic militants. But Thompson said the move was “not adequate or appropriate” to address his request for a hearing on threats from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.

“The September 12 hearing to cover worldwide threats is an annual hearing that was already scheduled prior to the domestic attacks this weekend,” Thompson said. “It will not allow us to go into the depth necessary to address the far-ranging and multifaceted aspects of the threat posed by domestic terrorist threats from white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.”

The Homeland Security Committee will invite leaders of the Homeland Security Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center, McCaul said. “We must stand together and reject racism, bigotry, and prejudice, including the hateful ideologies promoted by neo-Nazis, the KKK, and all other white supremacy groups,” McCaul wrote in his response to Democrats’ request for a hearing.

A 32-year-old woman was killed on Saturday in Charlottesville when a car plowed into a rival protest to white supremacist demonstrators. A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies has been charged with murder.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said both sides were to blame for the violence, drawing condemnation from both fellow Republicans and Democrats for failing to single out the white nationalists.

A van crashed into dozens of people in the centre of Barcelona on Thursday and Spanish media said at least two people were killed. Police said several people were injured and described the incident on Twitter as a “massive crash”. A police spokesman said he could not confirm any deaths or that the incident was being treated as terrorism. Soon afterwards, Spain’s El Periodico newspaper reported that two armed men were holed up in a bar in Barcelona’s city centre, and reported gunfire in the area, although it did not cite the source of the information.

It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were connected. Following the van crash, emergency services said people should not go to the area around Barcelona’s Placa Catalunya, one of the city’s main squares at the top of the famous Las Ramblas avenue, and requested the closure of nearby train and metro stations.

El Pais newspaper said the driver of the vehicle had fled on foot after mowing down dozens of people. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured. The incident took place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe’s top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.

While full details of the van incident were not immediately clear, vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe since July 2016, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm. Witness Ethan Spibey told Britain’s Sky News: “All of sudden it was real chaos. People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.”

He said he had taken refuge with dozens of other people in a nearby church. “They’ve locked the doors because I’m not sure whether the person who may have done it has actually been caught, so they’ve locked the doors and told people just to wait in here.” In recent weeks, threatening graffiti against tourists has appeared in Barcelona. In one video released under the slogan “tourism kills neighbourhoods”, several hooded individuals stopped a tourist bus in Barcelona, slashed the tyres and spray-painted the windscreen.

The deadliest recent attack in Spain was in March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

Muzaffarnagar: NSA against three held under cow slaughter Act,"Among the three accused, Bhura alias Israil and Khalil alias Leelu have been in prison since June 26, while Inaam was sent to jail on July 23. Police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case. (File/Representational) Among the three accused, Bhura alias Israil and Khalil alias Leelu have been in prison since June 26, while Inaam was sent to jail on July 23. Police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case. (File/Representational)

THE MUZAFFARNAGAR district administration has invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against three people arrested in June-July under the UP Cow Slaughter Act and various other charges. The accused are lodged in the district jail.

Station House Officer (SHO) of Janshath police station, Kamal Singh Chauhan, said: “A recommendation was made to District Magistrate (Muzaffarnagar) G S Priyadarshi, requesting to invoke the NSA on the three accused along with a report containing details of the case. The request was accepted and I served the order invoking the NSA against the accused in Muzaffarnagar district jail on August 14.”

Priyadarshi confirmed that the NSA had been invoked against the accused on the police recommendation.

Among the three accused, Bhura alias Israil and Khalil alias Leelu have been in prison since June 26, while Inaam was sent to jail on July 23. Police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case.

According to Chauhan, on the morning of June 24, police received information about the slaughter of a cow at Katka village. A team rushed to the spot, where the accused allegedly fired at them, injuring a constable. The police team, however, managed to nab Bhura and Khalil, residents of the neighbouring Khedi Firozabad village, added Chauhan.

The SHO further said that the team recovered flesh, skin and body parts of a bullock, knives used for slaughtering the animal and a country-made pistol from the spot. A bullock was also found tied with a rope near the spot, he added.

A case was lodged against Bhura, Khalil and others under the UP Cow Slaughter Act, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the Arms Act and sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (common object) of the IPC.

“The flesh seized from the place was not sent for lab tests as the district veterinary officer had visited the spot immediately after the raid. He had confirmed the meat as that of a bullock. Parts of the animal’s body as tail, skins and horns too had confirmed it was a bullock,” said Chauhan.

On July 22, another accused, Inaam, was arrested from his house in the Kakroli area in Muzaffarnagar, the SHO added.

The superintendent of Muzaffarnagar district jail Arun Saxena said the NSA report has been received by the prison.

In June, DGP Sulkhan Singh had issued directions to take strict action against those involved in cow slaughter, smuggling of cows and their progeny by invoking the NSA and the Gangsters Act against them. The DGP had clarified that the district magistrate and police chief can decide what action needs to be taken after taking into consideration the gravity of the situation.

Kareena Kapoor or Jacqueline Fernandez: Who aced the lace?,"Kareena Kapoor or Jacqueline Fernandez — whose look do you like better?(Source: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Lakshmi Lehr/Instagram) Kareena Kapoor or Jacqueline Fernandez — whose look do you like better?(Source: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Lakshmi Lehr/Instagram)

She might be yet to actively begin working, but new mommy-in-town Kareena Kapoor Khan continues to be at the top of the Bollywood fashion pack. After child birth while she is busy getting back in shape, Kareena has often given fashion goals while at it. But in the pictures from husband husband Saif Ali Khan’s birthday party, we just couldn’t help but be a bit disappointed.

While we loved the sultry black blouse with lace details and lantern sleeves from Self-Portrait that she paired with black fitted pants, the nude lipstick she wore made the entire look an absolute drab. She tied her hair into a sleek bun, which made it even worse because there was just too much bronzing and the contouring seem to have gone all wrong. This, coupled with the bad lighting of the camera made this one of her worst looks of recent times. It would have been relieving had Kareena gone for a marsala shade to add a stroke of colour to her look.

But it seems Jacqueline Fernandez, busy promoting her upcoming film A Gentleman, has got her lace fashion on point. The actor was seen in a navy blue lace detailed top from Saloni that she paired with a shimmering red skirt from the same fashion house. She chose a pair of silver heels from Christian Louboutin to go along with her outfit and left her wavy hair open.

While both Kareena and Jacqueline look stunning in their lace tops, the latter has chosen to go for make-up that complements her attire.

Surround space: Parul Sharma’s debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma’s photographs One of Parul Sharma’s photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the “asymmetry of everydayness”. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma’s sojourns in the last couple of years — Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi — but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. “I don’t like to put anything in a box. I don’t want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,” says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. “It has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,” says Sharma.

"Teen was unaccompanied, parents ‘equally responsible’ for death: Thane Municipal Transport","“The deceased was standing with his cycle on the road, therefore he is 100% negligent. Applicants were not accompanying the deceased at the time of the accident, therefore they are also equally responsible for the death of the deceased,” the TMT had said before the tribunal. (Representational image) “The deceased was standing with his cycle on the road, therefore he is 100% negligent. Applicants were not accompanying the deceased at the time of the accident, therefore they are also equally responsible for the death of the deceased,” the TMT had said before the tribunal. (Representational image)

Setting aside the Thane Municipal Transport’s argument that parents of an unaccompanied 13-year-old boy who died after being run over by a TMT bus were “equally responsible” for his death, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) has directed the undertaking to pay compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the family.

The TMT had submitted that since the teenager was not accompanied by his parents at the time of the accident, they had an equal part in his death. According to the submissions made by Tarabai Rathod before the Thane tribunal, her son Mangesh (13) was standing on the extreme left side of the road at Kalwa market when a speeding TMT bus knocked him down on October 18, 2016. He was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The TMT denied that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving.

“The deceased was standing with his cycle on the road, therefore he is 100% negligent. Applicants were not accompanying the deceased at the time of the accident, therefore they are also equally responsible for the death of the deceased,” the TMT had said before the tribunal.

The driver of the bus, while deposing, submitted before the tribunal that he had stopped at a bus stop to let passengers board. When he started his bus again, he heard a loud noise at the front left side. He claimed to have stopped the bus and after getting down saw that a child had slipped and fallen on the road. He claimed that it was due to the impact of the fall that the child received injuries and that there was no impact between the bus and the child. It was submitted during cross-examination, however, that an FIR was registered against the driver and he had not initiated any proceeding to quash it or made any complaint to the police.

The tribunal observed that since the evidence of the bus driver and the conductor were inconsistent with the police investigation paper, it showed the accident occurred due to the “sole negligence” of the driver. While deciding compensation, the court factored in the future income loss and the age of the deceased.

In a similar case decided by the Thane tribunal, the family of a two-year-old girl was given. Rs 5 lakh, two years after she was crushed under a dumper. The insurance company in that case too had said since the parents of the girl had allowed their minor daughter to play on the road, they were also negligent. The tribunal, however, ruled that it was the dumper driver’s fault and directed the insurance company and the driver to pay the compensation.

Related News Sterling flirts with $1.31 as inflation data eyed

Britain’s labor market outperformed tepid growth in the rest of the economy in the second quarter as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to its lowest since 1975, official data showed on Wednesday.

Sterling jumped nearly half a cent against the U.S. dollar and British government bond prices slid after the jobless rate edged down to 4.4 percent in the three months to June, against expectations for it to hold at 4.5 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.

Figures on wage growth also came in better than expected but they were flattered by bonus payments in the financial sector. The underlying picture still showed households feeling the strain of rising prices since last year’s Brexit vote.

“Ongoing anemic earnings growth reinforces the … case for the Bank of England to hold off from an interest rate (hike) any time soon – especially given a struggling economy and highly uncertain outlook,” said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.

Inflation has eased slightly since May when it hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent, but prices are still rising faster than wages.

The Office for National Statistics said workers’ total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.1 percent in the three months to June, compared with 1.9 percent in the period to May, boosted by a 27 percent surge in bonus payments in the financial sector.

Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 1.8 percent.

Overall wage growth in real terms fell by 0.5 percent, the same as in the three months to May and one of the steepest declines in the past three years.

Excluding bonuses – which analysts say gives a better picture of the underlying trend – earnings in nominal terms rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year, the fastest rate since January and beating expectations for a 2.0 percent rise.

The Bank of England is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation is creating longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019.

Separate ONS figures showed productivity – perhaps Britain’s biggest economic weak point since the financial crisis – fell by 0.1 percent in output-per-hours terms during the second quarter compared with the first quarter, when it fell 0.5 percent.

The labor market data suggested no sign of a drop in foreign workers since last year’s Brexit vote. Non-British born people working totaled 5.68 million people in the second quarter, up 262,000 from a year ago.

The decision was announced today after days of increasingly bellicose rhetoric between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un’s regime, which has raised international alarm about where the crisis is headed.

Beijing had pledged to fully enforce the latest sanctions after the United States accused China of not doing enough to rein in its neighbour, which relies heavily on the Asian giant for its economic survival.

The Chinese commerce ministry said on its website that all imports of coal, iron, iron ore and seafood will be “completely prohibited” from tomorrow. Beijing had already announced a suspension of coal imports in February.

The United Nations Security Council, including permanent member Beijing, approved tough sanctions against Pyongyang on August 6 that could cost the country USD 1 billion a year.

The sanctions were in response to the North’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, after which Kim boasted that he could now strike any part of the United States.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi vowed after the UN sanctions were approved that his country “will for sure implement that new resolution 100 per cent, fully and strictly”. China, which is suspected of failing to enforce past UN measures, accounts for 90 per cent of North Korea’s trade.

Trump complained in July that trade between the two nations had increased by nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter.

Beijing has defended its economic ties with Pyongyang as normal commerce between neighbours and insisted the trade did not violate UN sanctions. The suspension of coal imports deprives North Korea of massive income as it totalled USD 1.2 billion last year.

Among the latest banned products, China imported USD 74.4 million worth of iron ore in the first five months of this year, almost equalling the figure for all of 2016. Fish and seafood imports totalled USD 46.7 million in June, up from USD 13.6 million in May.

The United States angered China in June when it imposed unilateral sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean cash.

Trump will today formally order a probe into China’s intellectual property practices, though US officials said it was not linked to the North Korean matter.

“It’s not appropriate to use one issue as a tool to keep pressure on the other issue,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing.

Regional tensions have soared in the past week as Trump warned North Korea it would face “fire and fury” if it attacked the United States, while the North threatened to test-fire its missiles over Japan and towards the US Pacific island of Guam. Japan has deployed Patriot missile defences in four prefectures in response.

“We will do our best to prevent (North Korea) from taking such acts by stepping up pressure through the UN,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday. “The government’s heaviest responsibility is to secure our people’s lives.”

The war of words has sparked global concern, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides in a phone call with Trump over the weekend.

South Korean President Moon Jae-In, a left-leaning leader who has previously advocated dialogue with the North, joined the appeals for restraint today.

Moon called for an end to “all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further”.

The governor of Guam, Eddie Calvo, defended Trump’s rhetoric against Kim’s regime, saying in an interview with AFP that “sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in China has pleaded for a resumption of long-dormant six-nation talks to peacefully resolve the crisis.

But its proposal for North Korea to suspend its arms programmes in return for the United States to halt military drills in the region has been ignored.

“The relevant parties should exercise restraint, in order to avoid aggravating the words and deeds of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua said.

Israel builds underground wall after Gaza tunnel trauma,"In the 2014 war, Hamas militants several times made their way into Israel through a tunnel network, terrifying locals. (Source: File) In the 2014 war, Hamas militants several times made their way into Israel through a tunnel network, terrifying locals. (Source: File)

Israel is pressing ahead with construction of an underground barrier along the border with the Gaza Strip in an ambitious project meant to halt the threat of attack tunnels built by the Hamas militant group.Israel is pressing ahead with construction of an underground barrier along the border with the Gaza Strip in an ambitious project meant to halt the threat of attack tunnels built by the Hamas militant group. Cranes and work crews are digging holes and installing sensors and other equipment for a structure that is expected to stretch along the entire 60-kilometer (40-mile) border when it is complete.

Gadi Yarkoni, head of the local Eshkol regional council, said the project is a key reason that the area has enjoyed a surge in growth and attracted young families since a devastating war with Hamas three years ago.

“I believe building the barrier is the right thing to do, to build in order to stop and to give an answer to the issue of the tunnels, and to the issue of the communities in the area,” he said. “The surge in development in this area is unbelievable.”

During the 2014 war, Hamas militants on several occasions made their way into Israel through a tunnel network that caught Israel off guard. Although they did not manage to reach civilian areas, the infiltrations terrified the local population. Israel destroyed 32 tunnels during that conflict, and since then has made neutralizing the tunnel threat a top priority.

Israeli defense officials have said little about the new barrier project or how much has been completed. At one construction zone, a sign said “military zone – no passage,” and Associated Press reporters could not approach as cranes and bulldozers were at work.

Last week, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, head of Israel’s Southern Command, which is responsible for Gaza, told reporters the project would take about two years to complete.

He said the barrier would stretch several meters (yards) above and below ground and be equipped with sophisticated sensors. It’s being built entirely on the Israeli side of the border, to avoid friction with Hamas.

Atai Shelach, a retired colonel and former commander of the Israeli military’s “Yahalom” unit in charge of dismantling the militants’ tunnels, said the new barrier would be a game-changer, but would not solve the problem on its own.

“It is part of a cocktail, or a combination of many other solutions,” he said. Neutralizing the tunnel threat will also require good intelligence and operational decisions by the army, he said. Otherwise, militants will eventually figure out how to get through.

“That barrier can prevent war,” he said, because it will be harder for Hamas and other militant groups to “create surprises” that frighten Israeli residents.

Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.

While Hamas has largely respected a cease-fire that ended the last round of fighting in 2014, it is believed to be building new tunnels and re-arming in preparation for future conflict.

Hamas seeks Israel’s destruction.

“All the measures by the occupation on the border will not provide security for them,” said Hazem Qasem, a spokesman for the group. “As long as they occupy the Palestinian land and put a siege on our people in the Gaza Strip, the resistance will continue to possess all the means of force that enable it to defend the people against Israeli aggression,” he said.

Israeli residents expressed mixed feelings about the new structure.

Miriam Diener, a resident of Kibbutz Nirim, a communal farm near the Gaza border, said Israel must seek peace with its neighbors, and not just build new barriers.

“No fence will solve the problems,” she said. “Only peace will bring the possibility of a good economy, good education, good hospitals, good health. That is what is needed.”

But Shimon Avraham, another kibbutz resident, said the project will put people at ease after the terrifying experience of tunnel attacks.

“Now it makes things feel calmer,” he said.

Associated Press writer Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Britain seeks Brexit without borders for Northern Ireland,"As part of a series of papers that Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will push forward talks with the EU, the government on Tuesday outlined its vision for a “frictionless” frontier without “physical border infrastructure and border posts”.

Britain has said there should be no border posts between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, in a paper that attempts to resolve one of the most complex aspects of its exit from the European Union. Some 30,000 people cross the 500-km border every day without customs or immigration checks; negotiators must work out how to tighten controls without inflaming tensions in a region that suffered decades of bloody turmoil before a peace deal in 1998.

As part of a series of papers that Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will push forward talks with the EU, the government on Tuesday outlined its vision for a “frictionless” frontier without “physical border infrastructure and border posts”. May also said Britain would consider stepping in to replace some EU funding for peace projects in Northern Ireland after it leaves the bloc in March 2019 and beyond, to prevent a resurgence of violence between pro-British Protestants and Catholic Irish nationalists.

“Both sides need to show flexibility and imagination,” said a British government source, who declined to be named. “We have some very clear principles. Top of our list is to agree, up front, no physical border infrastructure — that would mean a return to the border posts of the past and is completely unacceptable to the UK.”

Commenting on an advance briefing of the position paper, the Irish government said it was “timely and helpful” and that it hoped enough progress could be made to move talks forward. “Protecting the peace process is crucial and it must not become a bargaining chip in the negotiations,” it said.

But Senator Mark Daly, deputy leader of Ireland’s opposition Fianna Fáil party, said the proposals for a frictionless border appeared “more like fiction, and clueless on this island”. “It will be a smugglers’ charter,” he told BBC Radio Four.

FRICTIONLESS TRADE?

Northern Ireland sold 2.7 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) of goods into Ireland in 2015, according to official figures, and many businesses have complex supply chains that involve crossing the border multiple times during the production process. Britain said it wanted to maintain a Common Travel Area, a pact that allows free movement between the United Kingdom and Ireland for British and Irish citizens, and introduce new ‘trusted trader’ arrangements to help larger companies. Smaller firms would be exempt from customs processes.

It rejected the idea of an effective customs border in the Irish Sea that separates England, Wales and Scotland from Ireland and Northern Ireland as “not constitutionally or economically viable”. The border is one of three priority issues that the EU is insisting must be dealt with during the opening rounds of talks before moving on to Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.

The first two rounds of divorce talks in Brussels have made limited progress and Britain is keen to push them forward by publishing documents outlining its vision for future ties. Britain’s proposals for Northern Ireland fit with a paper on post-Brexit customs arrangements that the government outlined on Tuesday, which suggested either having no customs border or introducing ‘highly-streamlined’ customs checks.

Those ideas met with scepticism among some of Britain’s current EU partners, with one EU official describing the idea of an invisible border as ‘fantasy’. May again said Britain would guarantee funding under the EU’s Peace initiative until the current round of funding ends in 2020. In an article in the Irish News newspaper, May said: “We then want to go further, and explore a potential future programme of peace funding after we leave the EU.”

SPECIAL REPORT-How Syria continued to gas its people as the world looked on,"A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. (Source: Reuters) A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. (Source: Reuters)

In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.

When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.

“Look, there is nothing to see,” said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.

So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.

The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria’s weapons of mass destruction.

A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.

They suspect that President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.

There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.

“The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that’s a polite way of describing it,” Angela Kane, who was the United Nation’s high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. “Were they happily collaborating? No.”

“What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,” she added.

That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. “I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,” she said. “We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.”

The extent of Syria’s reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors’ relationship with Assad’s administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:

– Syria’s declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.

– Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not “scientifically credible.” Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.

– At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria’s military.

– In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria’s disclosures.

“There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,” OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.

But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job “to ensure the full compliance” of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.

Syria’s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country’s cooperation with international inspectors.

“I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,” he told Reuters in an interview.

Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.

SARIN ATTACK

On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad’s forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.

In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad’s government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme – after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.

Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.

But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.

And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria’s foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.

Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.

The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.

The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad’s forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad’s forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.

Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine’s use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.

A source involved in monitoring Syria’s chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as “a weapon of terror” to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.

“The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That’s why they started using chlorine,” said the source.

A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria’s chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria’s declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.

OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.

Uzumcu said the team’s conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.

Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government’s Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme’s headquarters.

“Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that … I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,” Kane said.

Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.

“The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,” Uzumcu said.

He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.

Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria’s membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.

Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria’s chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.

POLITICAL DEADLOCK

The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.

In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.

The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.

Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.

Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment.

SARIN FOUND

Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.

A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.

“To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs’ payload,” said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was “a real, high-level, command structure behind this.”

Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.

The team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria’s deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.

Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. “Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?” he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.

The attack means either “that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,” Sellstrom said.

Donald Trump signs order to speed infra construction,"US President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File) US President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File)

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he has signed a new executive order intended to make more efficient the federal permitting process for construction of transportation, water and other infrastructure projects without harming the environment. Trump’s order includes revoking an earlier executive order signed by President Barack Obama concerning projects built in flood plains, White House officials said. The Obama order required that such projects built with federal aid take rising sea levels into account. Trump has suggested the predicted risks from sea level rise driven by climate change are overblown.

Describing his action, Trump said projects will still be subjected to environmental safeguards. “It’s going to be quick, it’s going to be a very streamlined process,” Trump said. “And by the way, if it doesn’t meet environmental safeguards, we’re not going to approve it. Very simple. We’re not going to approve it.”

Building trade groups had urged Trump to revoke the flood plain order, saying it was overly bureaucratic and increased the cost of projects. The Obama order was especially unwieldy because it didn’t standardize across the government how sea level rise was to be taken into account, which left each federal agency to come up with its own standards, said Jimmy Christianson, an attorney with the Associated General Contractors.

A recent draft of an upcoming report from scientists representing 13 federal agencies say sea levels along US coastlines could rise by more than one foot on average by 2050, potentially more in the Northeast and western Gulf of Mexico. A projected increase in the intensity of hurricanes in the North Atlantic will increase the probability of “extreme coastal flooding.”

Environmentalists said Tuesday that ignoring the reality of the Earth’s changing climate is shortsighted. “What this order will do is ensure that we will waste more taxpayer money because federal agencies will no longer have to consider long-term flood risks to federally funded infrastructure projects,” said Jessica Grannis, who manages the adaptation program at the Georgetown Climate Center.

The president, speaking at a news conference at Trump Tower in New York, said it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and 17 years to approve an ordinary highway project because of burdensome regulations. Under Trump’s order, agencies must complete environmental reviews of projects within two years on average. Trump signed another executive order on streamlining environmental and public reviews of infrastructure projects his first week in office.

“We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world. And today we’re like a third-world country,” Trump said, using a term referring to the economically developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has said that regulations, not a lack of funding, are a primary holdup faced by transportation infrastructure projects. But a Treasury Department report released earlier this year found that “a lack of public funding is by far the most common factor hindering completion” of major transportation and water infrastructure projects.

Democrats have said the administration would be better off implementing streamlining provisions already in law than attempting new efforts. Congress passed transportation funding laws in 2012 and 2015 with dozens of streamlining provisions.

A report by the Transportation Department’s inspector general this spring found that although the department had completed work necessary to implement a majority of the 42 streamlining provisions in the 2012 law, they had still not been implemented because regulators had to make changes to comply with the requirements of the 2015 law.

Shannon Eggleston, the American Association of State, Highway and Transportation Officials’ program director for environment, said there is still room to make adjustments to the processes for complying with laws protecting endangered species and air quality that won’t hurt the environment.

Macron tells Erdogan he wants detained journalist back in France,"French President Emmanuel Macron (REUTERS/Christian Hartmann) French President Emmanuel Macron (REUTERS/Christian Hartmann)

President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday expressed his concerns over a French journalism student detained in Turkey in a telephone call with Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, the Elysee Palace said. Loup Bureau was seized by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August after he was found to have photographs and interviews with Kurdish militia fighters among his possessions.

France has been trying to gain consular protection. Macron told Erdogan he wanted “that our compatriot be able to return to France as soon as possible,” according to the statement. The two leaders will discuss the matter again next week.

Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia to be an extension of the PKK, which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey and is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara, the United States and European Union. Macron and Erdogan also discussed the Syrian conflict. The French president reiterated his hopes to pursue a narrow-focused dialogue centred on the fight against terrorism and an inclusive political solution for peace and a unified Syria.

"Media in China toes govt line, in India its independent: Kiren Rijiju","Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju (File Photo) Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju (File Photo)

The media in India and China cannot be compared as the fourth estate in this country is independent, while its counterparts in the Communist nation generally toe the official line, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said here today. His comments came in response to a question from a student at an event about stories appearing in Chinese media in the wake of Dokalam stand-off.

“In China, Xinhua, a news agency, People’s Daily, a newspaper, and their nationalist media which is the Global Times are basically controlled by the Communist Party. This media’s mainstream line is aligning with the policies and programmes of the People’s Republic of China government,” the Union minister of state for home affairs said.

“Whereas, the media in India is very independent of the government. Th media can criticise the government, the media can write anything. The positions being taken by the Chinese media and the Indian media cannot be compared because the situation and the circumstances are totally different,” he said.

Rijiju, however, declined to comment on the Dokalam stand-off and several other related queries. Asked why curbs cannot be put on social media as a means to check cyber crime against women as China has done, Rijiju said there is a “huge debate” going on in the country on the issue.

He said he personally favoured putting in place some “reasonable restrictions” without hurting individual freedom. “Right now, there is a huge debate going on in India. Is national security is more important or privacy… You cannot have everything together,” he said.

China is an authoritarian country where individual liberty can be curbed in the name of state security, the minister said. “Here, if we do that, there will be huge a hungama,” he said.

Recalling that the UPA government had summoned a social networking site in 2012 when some “vulgar postings” appeared about Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he said the NDA government has not done what the previous government did, although “vulgar pictures” of the prime minister and other leaders have appeared.

“Still, the point you raised, women are being trolled, followed or in some cases, I personally feel that we must have restrictions, but reasonable restrictions. Individual freedom must be given due respect, but at the same time we must have some kind of restrictions. That is possible only if the civil society lends its support.

“If the people say no and refuse to cooperate with the government…we cannot go against the wishes of the people,” Rijiju said. In his address to the gathering earlier, he said the country faced challenges in Jammu and Kashmir, the northeast and in the coastal front and that the government is alive to the situation.

“But things are becoming normal (in Jammu and Kashmir). Because our government is committed to tackling the challenge,” he said.

"Netherlands: Man holds woman hostage, arrested","Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Dutch police quickly arrested a man armed with a knife who briefly held a woman hostage Thursday at a radio station building in the Netherlands. The woman was shocked but otherwise unhurt in the early morning incident in Hilversum, southeast of Amsterdam, said Ellen Deheer, a police spokeswoman for the Middle Netherlands region. The man’s identity and motives weren’t immediately clear, she said.

“We will talk to him about what his reasons were to take this woman as a hostage,” Deheer said. “She is shocked at this moment. It will take some time to talk to her about this.”

The man threatened the woman with a knife outside the building and forced her inside, according to another police media officer, Leonie Bosselaar. After sealing off the area, police “decided to end the situation” two hours later, entering the building, arresting the man and rescuing the woman, said Deheer.

Karan Johar does not settle for anything less than extraordinary and the same applies to his collection of bags. The Bollywood director who has given us hits like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham… and Student of the Year is known for living a flamboyant life. His love for shoes is well known, but over the last couple of months he has been obsessed with statement-worthy bags. We have seen him flaunt a couple of quirky ones while jet-setting off to exotic locales.

The first one which caught our eyes was a Gucci tote with an embroidered angry cat face on it. We felt it was really quirky and a must-have, until we found the price of his prized possession. It cost a whopping Rs1.5 lakh, a budget that could easily fund a backpacking trip in Europe!

The latest one on his list is the Louis Vuitton x Supreme Epi Keepall Bandouliere bag – a limited edition – worth $3,650. That is around Rs 2 lakh in Indian currency.

Thinking of another trip you could have taken with that money? We are too. By the way, he is the only Indian to own that bag.

Recently, Johar was also spotted carrying a swanky mini-suitcase with really cool prints on it. The Gucci Courrier GG Supreme suitcase, one of the two styles launched by the luxury brand is really fun but like always, the price of this one too might give you a heart attack.

It comes for $ 3,980, that’s approximately Rs 2.5 lakh. Now, we are beginning to wonder if he has anything under a lakh in his collection.

Sigh, talk about living a fabulous life!

Indonesian president calls to safeguard pluralism from extremist threat,"Indonesian President Joko Widodo. (Source: File) Indonesian President Joko Widodo. (Source: File)

Indonesia’s president said on Wednesday that the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country needed to pull together to meet the threat of extremism and safeguard a constitution that enshrines religious freedom and diversity. In an address to parliament ahead of Thursday’s independence day, President Joko Widodo peppered his speech with references to the need to address inequality in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and tackle the threat of radicalism. Indonesian police on Tuesday arrested five suspected Islamist militants and seized chemicals near the capital, Jakarta, that they said were being used to make bombs for attacks on the presidential palace at the end of August.

Religious tension in Indonesia has soared since late last year after Islamist-led rallies saw Jakarta’s then governor, a member of a so-called double minority who is ethnic Chinese and Christian, put on trial during city elections over claims he insulted the Koran.

“We want to work together not only in creating an equitable economy, but also in ideological, political, social and cultural development,” said Widodo.

“In the field of ideology, we have to strengthen our national consensus in safeguarding Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, the unity of the Republic of Indonesia and “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” (unity in diversity),” he said.

Pancasila is Indonesia’s state ideology, which includes belief in god, the unity of the country, social justice and democracy, and which enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system.

But there are worries about growing intolerance undermining a tradition of moderate Islam in a country where Muslims form about 85 percent of the population, alongside substantial Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and other minorities.

In April, the then Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of Widodo, lost the bitterly fought city election to a Muslim rival and was later jailed for blasphemy, a sentence rights groups and international bodies condemned as unfair and politicised.

“Because the challenges we face now and will face in the future are not easy. We are still confronted with poverty and injustice; we are still facing global economic uncertainty, and we are also facing movements of extremism, radicalism and terrorism,” said Widodo.

The president said the government needed to ensure that all state agencies “gain the highest trust of the people” and noted he had set up a presidential taskforce to oversee the teaching of the state ideology Pancasila, particularly to the young.

"Ahead of DUSU polls, students launch ‘no poster’ campaign","The group has begun removing posters around North Campus The group has begun removing posters around North Campus

“No paper wastage, no pizzas, no lakme kajal. If roads are dirty with your posters, we will not vote for you” — this is the campaign message issued by a group of students from Miranda House to ensure that this year’s Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections are paperless.

Launching the “No Poster Party” (NPP) campaign, the students said they want to implement the order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the “truest sense”. Taking note of the amount of paper wasted during last year’s election, the NGT had issued notice to Delhi University, the Centre and the Ministry of Environment and Forests against the wastage. Further, the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations on student union elections also allow the use of only handmade posters as poll material.

Simran Kapoor, a third-year BA programme student of Miranda House, who started the group along with six others during last year’s polls, said: “Every year, there are directives from the university but no one follows them. This time, we have started our campaign early so that we can make students aware and ask them not to vote for an organisation that defaces walls and wastes paper.”

Even though campaigning for the polls is yet to begin, the group has begun removing posters around North Campus. It is also performing nukkad nataks near the Vishwavidyalaya Metro station, asking students not to support organisations that waste paper. They have also asked DU to allow them to paint it with murals depicting “DU’s rich culture”.

The group said it will speak to candidates individually, asking them to refrain from wasting paper: “You can spam students on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter to promote candidates. This won’t harm the environment.”

Libyan army commander arrest sought by ICC for alleged executions and war crimes,"Judges at the ICC on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a LNA commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. (File Photo) Judges at the ICC on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a LNA commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. (File Photo)

Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a Libyan National Army (LNA)commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. Prosecutors at the world’s permanent war crimes court are seeking Mahmoud al-Werfalli’s hand-over to face charges of murder during the armed conflict in Libya.

According to the ICC, Werfalli “is alleged to have directly committed and to have ordered the commission of murder as a war crime” during seven incidents, involving 33 persons in June and July 2017 in and near Benghazi. The LNA, which controls the eastern part of Libya, has been pushing to expand its presence in the central and southern part of the country where it has been vying for control with forces linked to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and other groups.

The United Nations called for the LNA to suspend Werfalli after a video in March allegedly showed Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs. The LNA said it would investigate any potential war crimes but has not released any details of such a probe.

In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.

The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes in Libya after a referral by the United Nations Security Council in 2011 and has been investigating alleged atrocities there.

Supreme Court panel to examine why 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases closed,"The bench also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on another petition filed by victims of the anti-Sikh riots in Kanpur, demanding an SIT probe into the incidents. The bench also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on another petition filed by victims of the anti-Sikh riots in Kanpur, demanding an SIT probe into the incidents.

A “supervisory body” of two retired Supreme Court judges will scrutinise the closure by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of 241 cases related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. The SIT had been constituted by the Union Home Ministry in February 2015 to reinvestigate “serious cases” during the riots that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi. A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice Dipak Misra, Wednesday said the committee will examine whether the decision of the SIT to close the cases was correct or not. It will submit its report in three months and the court will take up the matter again on November 28.

The court did not name the judges of the committee and said it will be added to the order.

On March 24 this year, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to produce files of anti-Sikh riots cases that the SIT set up by the Home Ministry had decided to close.

The bench also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on another petition filed by victims of the anti-Sikh riots in Kanpur, demanding an SIT probe into the incidents. The bench asked their counsel Prasoon Kumar to hand over a copy of the petition to Uttar Pradesh Additional Advocate General Aishwarya Bhati.

Senior Counsel H S Phoolka, who represented the petitioners in the Delhi cases, told the court that “though the SIT’s mandate was all-India, but unfortunately they restricted themselves to Delhi… 126 deaths had taken place in Kanpur, but the cases were not taken up”.

Two years after its formation, the SIT has managed to file chargesheets only in a few cases taken up for further probe.

Phoolka and Senior Counsel Arvind Datar, who also represented petitioner Gurnad Singh, told the bench that only nine cases were on. They requested the court to order day-to-day trial. But the bench pointed out that it had already given its order and it only needed to be shown to the trial court.

NEET: Tamil Nadu students may get exemption as law ministry clears ordinance,"NEET 2017 was held on May 7 NEET 2017 was held on May 7

The law ministry on August 16 cleared an ordinance of the Tamil Nadu government which demands exemption of the state’s students from the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) — common medical entrance test. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cleared the draft ordinance in consultation with Attorney General K K Venugopal.

The official, who requested anonymity, said the ordinance will be applicable only to government colleges, and not private ones. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, state ministers and Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai had multiple meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other central ministers over NEET.

Tamil Nadu, which had initially sought permanent exemption from NEET by passing two bills in the Assembly, later made efforts to be out of its ambit for at least a year or two.

The NEET is a medical entrance examination for students who wish to study MBBS and BDS courses in government or private medical colleges. It is conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The NEET replaced the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) and all individual MBBS exams conducted by states or colleges. However, many colleges and institutes had taken a stay order and conducted private examinations for admission to their MBBS and BDS courses.

"Hizbul Mujahideen ban goes global, but will it reach the Valley?","A policeman tears apart a photo of slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani at Rambagh in Srinagar on Sunday, August 14, 2016. (Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) A policeman tears apart a photo of slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani at Rambagh in Srinagar on Sunday, August 14, 2016. (Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)

The US Department of State has designated Hizbul Mujahideen as a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation” and “Specially Designated Global Terrorist”. The above designation seeks to “deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks” besides blocking Hizbul’s property and interests subject to American jurisdiction and prohibiting persons from “engaging in any transactions with the group.”

From an Indian perspective, what does the above designation mean? Will it affect Hizbul’s functioning and prevent further recruitment within Kashmir Valley? Will it prevent Pakistan from supporting HM and Syed Salahudin?

Though the Hizbul has been projected as the largest “Kashmiri” militant group, during the last decade and half, it had lost the appeal to a more radical section such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad. The latter are based in Pakistan and are lethal in terms of attacks and ideological orientation.

For New Delhi, the US designation is strategic and political. While Pakistan has been pushing hard to project “Indian atrocities” in the Kashmir Valley, the latest designation of the Hizbul, and the earlier US declaration of Syed Salahudin as a global terrorist (during Modi’s visit to the US) makes a political point at global level. It shows, where the White House stands on the ongoing unrest in J&K; clearly, the Trump administration stands with New Delhi.

Does the American ban really matter to the militant groups and their patrons?

For India, the bigger challenge is Lashkar-e-Toiba. Earlier, the US has designated the following Pakistan-based groups as terrorist organisations: Harakat ul-Mujahidin (HuM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Lashkar-e-Jhanvi (LI), Ansal-al Islam (AI), Tehrike-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and Jundullah.

Outside these Pakistan based organisations, LTTE in Sri Lanka, Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami – Bangladesh (HuJI-B) and Indian Mujahdeen (IM) were also designated by the US as terrorist organisations. While the LTTE disintegrated after the killing of Prabhakaran, the other two in Bangladesh and India declined due to state action and also their inability to sustain popular support.

In case of Pakistan-based groups, the above has not happened. While the HuM declined during the 1990s, LeT, TTP, LI and Jundullah continue to operate – with and outside the State patronage. The Lashkar in particular has been openly challenging the ban; recently, it even announced the formation of a political party. While Hafiz Saeed was repeatedly placed under house arrest, it has neither affected his position, nor curbed Lashkar’s activities.

While the ban provides a political scoring point for India against Pakistan, the latter is unlikely to take any effective measure to curb the Hizbul. If the American military pressure and economic carrots have not prevented Pakistan’s Deep State to act against the Taliban and the Huqqanis, will the US designation against Hizbul make any effective change? Less likely. For rest of Pakistan, the Hizbul will remain a “separatist” group and not militant.

What next for Hizbul and New Delhi?

Hizbul may find another name, as Lashkar transformed itself into Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Syed Salahuddin may be placed under house arrest within Pakistan.

But the real issue for New Delhi would be the support and activities of the militant groups inside Kashmir. The American designation is a success for the South Block at the diplomatic level. The long term challenge for New Delhi would be to expand this, leading to the total disintegration of militancy and prevent the emergence of Burhan Wanis. For this, the North Block and the Prime Minister’s Office will have to work together and carry forward the international success into Srinagar and beyond.

Ahmedabad hospital transfer form says unavailability of ventilator; FIR against ‘doctor on duty’,"Darshan’s body being taken out of the hospital. Express photo by Preeti Das Darshan’s body being taken out of the hospital. Express photo by Preeti Das

Two days after a 17-month-old boy died reportedly because his empty oxygen cylinder was not replaced while being shifted to another hospital in an ambulance, it has come to light that the doctor in-charge at the city’s Sola Civil Hospital had citied non-availability of “ventilator (paediartic)”.

The transfer form stated “PICU (Paediatric intensive care Unit)/ Isolation/ Ventilator care (paediatric) non-available” as the reason for transfer. The form also mentioned that the child, Darshan Pagi, was admitted to the hospital on August 12 following H1N1 infection (swine flu), and he showed “signs of ARDS (acute respiratory distress)”.

While the name of the ward/in-charge doctor in the form has been stated as Dr Geet Gunjan, the health department claimed it was filled by Dr Mitesh Ramwani, senior resident, and the reason for transfer was “written wrong”. The Sola police station on Wednesday lodged an FIR against “the doctor on duty” on charges of negligence.

“The reason for transfer was written wrong. All the cylinders have enough oxygen. A team of senior doctors had checked the cylinders on August 15. We will be issuing a showcause notice to Dr Mitesh Ramwani, senior resident, who had filled the form,” Punamchand Parmar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, told The Indian Express over phone. Parmar is leading the investigation into the case.

Earlier in the day at a press conference in Gandhinagar, Parmar said, “Under the insistence of the child’s parents, he was being taken to Civil Hospital (in Asarwa) in ICU on wheels. There were two oxygen cylinders in the vehicle. However, the technician inside the ICU on wheels could not replace the small cylinder of the patient with the one inside the vehicle. For that, we have constituted an inquiry and will take the necessary action.”

Meanwhile, Darshan’s father Pravin Pagi — who had claimed his son’s body on Tuesday after 21 hours of the death following a written assurance from the medical superintendent of Sola Civil Hospital and police of a through probe — again had to wait for around six hours at Sola police station on Wednesday before the FIR was registered.

“I was told that a committee will look into the matter and suspend the doctor. I think suspending means not letting them work for some time. But that is less. I will not give up. Just because we are poor does not mean we can be taken for granted. I was in the ambulance when my child died. I saw his gasp for breath and die while the doctor was trying to open the oxygen cylinder in the ambulance,” said Pravin Pagi, a daily wage labourer from Surendranagar.

“He died because the hospital staff did not check the oxygen cylinder. I am not sure if there was oxygen in his cylinder… On Sunday, no doctor came to check him and by the evening his condition started deteriorating,” he said. Darshan died at around 6.30 pm on Monday.

Conceding that the boy’s oxygen cylinder was not changed, Dr H K Bhavsar, medical superintendent of Sola Civil Hospital, said: ?”According to our information, the child was being transferred from one hospital to another as his condition was bad. He was being transferred in an ambulance or ICU on wheels. Along with the boy was the oxygen cylinder on which he was since the morning. The staff did not shift him to the oxygen cylinder in ambulance. There was one intern doctor, a driver and a conductor in the ambulance.” When asked the name of the doctor on duty Dr Bhavsar said, “Will give more details as soon as we hear from the investigation committee.”

M L Rajput, the police official investigating the case, said: “There are names of many doctors and we do not know who was the doctor on duty… We will go to the hospital tomorrow and find out more details.”

Big-spending AC Milan throw down the gauntlet to Juventus,"AC Milan hadn’t featured in European competition since March 2014 before it won in the previous round. (Source: AP) AC Milan hadn’t featured in European competition since March 2014 before it won in the previous round. (Source: AP)

After years of midtable mediocrity, AC Milan have thrown down the gauntlet to Juventus by assembling a team which supporters believe can end the Turin side’s run of six successive Serie A titles.

Under new Chinese owners, the seven-times European champions have splurged 190 million euros ($222.30 million) on transfers and, for a change, the money has gone on players who appear to have their best years ahead of them. Milan, the last team to win Serie A before Juve’s era of dominance began, have endured a decline which coincided with Serie A’s own fall from grace.

For most of former Italy Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s three decades as club president, they had enjoyed a golden era but his last few years became a story of unsuccessful transfers and musical chairs in the coach’s seat. As the world’s top players eschewed Serie A, Berlusconi promised that his club would concentrate on developing its own young talents instead – but ended up signing players who were past their best.

The likes of Kaka, in his second spell, Fernando Torres, Michael Essien, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Alessio Cerci, Mario Balotelli and Mattia Destro all came and went without making an impact.

Inevitably, the coach paid the price with Clarence Seedorf, Filippo Inzaghi, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Cristian Brocchi occupying the hot seat between Massimiliano Allegri’s dismissal in January 2014 and Vincenzo Montella’s arrival in June last year.

But there has been a dramatic change of direction since Berlusconi agreed to sell the club to a Chinese-led consortium in a 740 million-euro deal in April and the new owners installed Marco Fassone, an experienced business executive, as general manager.

New signings have included striker Andre Silva (21) from Porto who has scored eight goals in 13 appearances for Portugal; right back Andrea Conti (23), a product of Atalanta’s impressive youth scheme; Ricardo Rodriguez (24), a Swiss international regarded as one of Europe’s most accomplished left backs; and Turkish midfielder and free-kick specialist Hakan Calhanoglu (23).

The latter two were signed from Bundesliga clubs VfL Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen respectively.

The biggest coup was landing Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci from Juventus, ending the Turin club’s so-called BBC defence that also featured Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini and which had been together since 2010. “We have chosen players who are ready to go and can give a great deal, who are top players for our level and for Italian football,” said Montella. “The potential is there and it is only a matter of time.”

Milan were still hoping to add a big-money striker to the squad before the end of the transfer window.

Juve were left to spend the summer contemplating their 4-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final and they started the season by losing 3-2 to Lazio in the Italian Supercup final. But they still have the top four outstanding players in Serie A – goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Chiellini and Argentine forwards Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain — and remain favourites.

Napoli, widely acclaimed as playing the best football on their way to third place last season, have kept their squad intact and once again pose a threat.

AS Roma, last season’s runners-up, have seen the departure of several key players including defender Antonio Ruediger and winger Mohamed Salah, while Franceso Totti retired after a remarkable 25 seasons at the club. Inter Milan, also under Chinese ownership, have not matched their neighbours’ spending in the transfer market but have hired coach Luciano Spalletti after he also left Roma.

Stuart Law urges West Indies to rewrite history against England,"West Indies Head Coach Stuart Law during nets. (Source: Reuters) West Indies Head Coach Stuart Law during nets. (Source: Reuters)

West Indies coach Stuart Law believes that his side can find cracks in the England team and ‘exploit their weakness’ in the upcoming day-night Test series. He said that his side is experience and has some good bowlers up front to do the job and urged them to rewrite history.

In an interview to espncricinfo, Law said, “With a couple of debutants or a couple of new guys to the fore in Test cricket, that’s an opportunity for our bowlers. You always look at any little crack you can find. We’ve some pretty experienced, pretty good bowlers up front as well. So it’s an opportunity for us to exploit those weaknesses.”

“Our players understand there’s a few comments flying around like that,” Law said. “And we’ve instructed them to use that as motivation to go out and play your best. There’s been a lot said about this cricket team and that is motivation for them. We’re looking forward. Let’s rewrite that history.”

Despite a not-so impressive performance by Kemar Roach recently, Law said, “Kemar had a bit of time out of the game with injuries and a nasty car accident. He’s had to fight his way back. He’s probably not as quick as he has been but I think he’s a better bowler for that. He is still fast enough to cause problems and he is swinging the ball both ways.”

“Shannon is coming along nicely. He is training the house down and just needs a bowl to get that rhythm back. He’s fit to bowl. We’re just waiting on him to hit his traps – do that and it’s 95mph coming at you. The ground was uneven in Derby. He hadn’t bowled for a while and he was over-striding. When he got it right he looked good. As for Jason… He’s a young man but very intelligent and high quality. The captaincy is a lot of responsibility but he does it with fantastic integrity. He’s a great leader. His bowling is more than very good and he can bat and score runs. He’s doing everything to make sure he captains this side not just this series but for 10 or 15 years.”

Pro Kabaddi Season 5: All-round Sandeep Narwal leads Puneri Paltan to thumping win over Bengal Warriors,"It was the first Inter Zone match of the season and it turned out to be a one sided affair. (Source: Pro Kabaddi release) It was the first Inter Zone match of the season and it turned out to be a one sided affair. (Source: Pro Kabaddi release)

It was an even match up between Puneri Paltan and Bengal Warriors until the 13th minute of the first half. That was when Sandeep Narwal’s Super Raid inflicted the first all-out of the game on the Warriors and gave Paltan a comprehensive lead of 12-5. It was a body blow that Bengal Warriors could not come back from and in the end, they succumbed to a 34-17 defeat at Ahmedabad. It was the first Inter Zone match of the season and it turned out to be a one sided affair. Sandeep, who was the star performer of the day, said that he wanted to gift his captain a perfect birthday gift. “A win today is what I wanted to gift Deepak and I’m glad that we did it,” he said in the post match presser.

Sandeep dodged Warriors defenders as if he had a rugby session before the match. While captain Deepak Niwas Hooda struggled to find a way through Warriors’ defence, Sandeep was effective in the attack. Sandeep along with Rajesh Mondal kept picking at the Warriors’ defence as the Pune outfit went into the half time with a seven-point lead. The score was 17-10.

“Speed is my strength and everytime I go for a raid, I am full of confidence,” Sandeep said. “Ulti seedha bhagne ki practice karta hoon. But this time, I have worked on it. I also try to look behind while I go for a touch,” he added.

The second half too was dominated by Puneri Paltan. Their defence kept Jang Kun Lee and Maninder relatively quiet. Bengal Warriors have depended upon the duo to get them raid points and, on the day, they failed to get them out of the pits, as was pointed out by Surjeet Singh. “Our raiders let us down,” said the Warriors’ captain in the post-match press conference, “If any of our raiders had clicked then the score line would have been better.”

But even he conceded that his team was affected by the performance of Sandeep Narwal. “Sandeep was phenomenal in defence,” he said. Sandeep Narwal was at his lethal best with his double ankle holds and full body dash. With support from Dharmaraj Cheralathan, Sandeep helped his side inflict three all-outs on Bengal Warriors. He was also playing a leaders’ role, rallying the defenders and ensuring that they stay alert when the opposition raiders came in. It is hence no wonder that Pune coach BC Ramesh believes that Sandeep’s form will help them maintain consistency in the coming weeks.

“We had thought that this will be a neck to neck contest. But Sandeep played brilliantly. He was good in all departments. Video analysis has helped us,” Ramesh concluded.

RBI still has room to slash key rate in current fiscal: Kidwai,"Reserve Bank of India Reserve Bank of India

The Reserve Bank still has room to cut the key policy rate in the current fiscal, veteran banker Naina Lal Kidwai has said, while stressing that banks should pass on the benefits of lower rates to customers. RBI reduced the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent earlier this month, citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.

“There is clearly room for further rate cuts. But the rate cut from RBI is not good enough. The rate cut has to happen from the way banks engage with industry, and that is a function on how efficient the banks are, what are their NPAs, their losses,” Kidwai told PTI on the sidelines of a conference here.

She further said the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans, going forward, will be a “big positive”. “Now moving forward with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, with industries’ own performance improving, there should be better resolution of the NPAs and they (banks) should be able to get the NPAs off their books,” said Kidwai, who has served as the Country Head of HSBC India, was also president of industry body Ficci.

She said she expects NPAs in the banking sector to come down slowly. The country’s banking sector is saddled with NPAs worth over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore alone are with public sector banks.

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world’s ‘longest’ suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‘Europabruecke’ bridge, connecting Grächen and Zermatt, is at a “dizzying height”, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

However, along with breathtaking view, it could literally take away the breath of people with vertigo. “The path runs between 1,600m and 2,200m above sea level and high above the deepest cut valley in Switzerland,” the tourism board added.

Tottenham Hotspur seek to make most of Chelsea’s woes,"Tottenham brushed off talk of their own problems over transfers and wage demands with a 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday. (Source: Reuters) Tottenham brushed off talk of their own problems over transfers and wage demands with a 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday. (Source: Reuters)

Tottenham Hotspur begin life at Wembley Stadium on Sunday when they take on Chelsea, hoping to quickly quash talk of discomfort at their temporary home by taking advantage of their rivals’ current problems.

Spurs, who finished runners-up to Antonio Conte’s champions, were unbeaten at White Hart Lane last season but managed just one win from five outings at Wembley, where they played in the Champions League group stage and lost in the FA Cup semifinal to Chelsea 4-2.

The North London club are building a new stadium next door to their old venue at White Hart Lane and will play all their home games at Wembley this campaign. Since the new Wembley was opened in 2007, Spurs have won only twice in 10 games there.

While Chelsea looked a tough opener when the fixtures were announced, there is little of the swagger of champions about Chelsea at the moment.

Conte’s side lost their opening Premier League home game 3-2 to Burnley and will be without skipper and key defender Gary Cahill and Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who are suspended after earning red cards against in that defeat.

With winger Eden Hazard and forward Pedro still sidelined with injury, Chelsea will hope that new arrival Alvaro Morata can rise to the occasion after impressing during his substitute appearance on Saturday.

Chelsea have dominated the headlines this week with reports of a rift between Conte and the club’s hierachy over transfer targets, and with their striker Diego Costa firing critical comments from his exile in Brazil.

The decision to sell midfielder Nemanja Matic to Manchester United has also been questioned, particularly given the Serb’s impressive debut for Manchester United last week.

Tottenham brushed off talk of their own problems over transfers and wage demands with a 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday, and apart from right-back Kieran Trippier they should be at full strength.

Tripper is expected to be replaced again by Kyle Walker-Peters, who impressed at St. James’ Park. Chelsea have an excellent record against Spurs in recent meetings, having lost just twice in the past 17 games in all competitions, though one of those defeats came in the last meeting at White Hart Lane in January.

"Key road link to Northeast snapped now, trucks line Bihar highway","One stretch of NH-31 has been kept for accommodating displaced people, with relief camps yet to be set up. The current is too fast to allow rebuilding of the approach road. One stretch of NH-31 has been kept for accommodating displaced people, with relief camps yet to be set up. The current is too fast to allow rebuilding of the approach road.

A KEY road link between Bihar and the Northeast has been snapped since August 14 evening. An approach road to a bridge over the river Mahananda along NH-31, which links Purnea to Kishanganj, is under water.

No train has plied between Guwahati and New Delhi via Bihar with tracks under 2-3 ft water. Most trains to the Northeast are being terminated at Katihar. Now with the road link snapped, trucks are stranded on either side of the highway for up to 20 km.

One stretch of NH-31 has been kept for accommodating displaced people, with relief camps yet to be set up. The current is too fast to allow rebuilding of the approach road.

“The town area is safe but people from lowlying areas and 50-odd villages are being forced to stay on the highway. Government help has just started to come in,” said Rajendra Singh, a bicycle shop owner at Baisi.

Truckers Manoj Kumar Giri and Deep Chand Sharma, who are carrying a consignment of apples from Shimla to Siliguri, are stuck at Gulab Bagh of Purnea. “It has been two days now,” said Sharma. “We had started from Shimla on August 12 but we don’t know when we can reach Siliguri.” Behind him are lined at least 15 trucks, all laden with apples.

Said Harendra Yadav, another truck driver and a resident of Gorakhpur: “If we are stuck here for a few more days, we will have to sell apples in local markets at any price we get.”

Gulab Bagh, the entry point to Purnea, has been packed with trucks for the last two days with movement possible only along one-way — out of Purnea towards Araria and Katihar. With the Mahananda breaching its banks at Pranpur and flooding at least 10 blocks, the route between Purnea and Khagaria too looks threatened.

Ritu Singh of Katihar said: “Some of my relatives are trapped in parts of Kishanganj for the last three days. No government help has reached them. They are getting help from Muslim neighbours in the crisis.”

As per disaster management department figures, 66 lakh people in 13 Bihar districts have been affected by floods. So far, 56 people have died in flood-related incidents. Araria has reported the maximum casualties, 25, with 20 bodies taken out of the Jogbani canal in last three days. West Champaran has reported 17 deaths.

The Seemanchal districts of Araria, Purnea, Kishanganj and Katihar are worst hit with the Mahananda, Kankai, Parman and Bakra in spate after continuous rains over last week and Nepal releasing extra water. At least 400 villages of Kishanganj are flooded.

"Rafael Nadal tops Richard Gasquet again, Frances Tiafoe upsets Alexander Zverev at Cincinnati Open","served out the match at love in the 10th game, firing in three aces, including the finishing point. (Source: USA Today Sports) served out the match at love in the 10th game, firing in three aces, including the finishing point. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Rafa Nadal extended his spotless record against Richard Gasquet, while unseeded American teenager Frances Tiafoe upset Alexander Zverev to reach the third round of the Cincinnati Open on Wednesday.

It must have felt like deja vu for the Frenchman, who fell 6-3 6-4 to drop to 0-15 against Nadal. Gasquet last won a set against the Spaniard in 2008.

Nadal, who repelled the only break point he faced in the match, served out the match at love in the 10th game, firing in three aces, including the finishing point.

“I work every day to play better. It’s obvious that was an important start for me, a good one,” said French Open champion Nadal, who will claim the world number one spot on Monday.

“Now I have another opportunity tomorrow to go on court and play.”

The 15-times grand slam winner will next face fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who eliminated Nadal’s Wimbledon conqueror, 16th seed Gilles Muller of Luxembourg, 5-7 6-4 6-4.

World number seven Zverev, who stunned Roger Federer in the Montreal final last week after claiming the title in Washington D.C., was on a 10-match winning streak but faded in the final set against energetic baseliner

Tiafoe, who won 4-6 6-3 6-4.

It was 19-year-old Tiafoe’s first win over a top-10 player and he bounded around the court in joy, thumping his chest to a standing ovation after Zverev floated a backhand long on match point with his third unforced error of the last game.

“I saw he was a bit tired, but he was still competing. It was tough. I was happy to get through it,” 87th-ranked Tiafoe told Tennis Channel. “My game plan was to keep the rallies long and keep him out there and that’s what I did.”

Tiafoe will meet John Isner next and said he knows he will be tested by his compatriot’s booming serve.

“I just got to weather the storm,” Tiafoe said. “He’s going to drop some big-boy heat on me and I’m going to have to be ready for it.”

Zverev, 20, was not dismayed too much by the defeat and said he was looking forward to the U.S. Open later this month.

“I think Roger (Federer) and Rafa are the strongest ones and a few guys coming after that. I think I am involved in that group. I am in that small group of players,” the German said.

“So I feel very confident the way I was playing in the last two weeks. And I think going into the U.S. Open, I feel the best I have ever felt maybe going into a slam.”

Earlier, Bulgarian seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov beat Feliciano Lopez 7-6(5) 6-4 to set up a last-16 clash with Juan Martin del Potro.

Del Potro advanced with a 6-4 6-4 win over American qualifier Mitchell Krueger, winning each set on a late break.

Dimitrov has not beaten Del Potro in five career meetings, with the most recent defeat coming at Rome in May.

Australian Nick Kyrgios beat Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 7-6(6) to reach the third round, where he will face unseeded Croatian Ivo Karlovic.

Afghan Taliban warns Donald Trump against sending in more troops to Afghanistan,"“Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,” the Taliban said in the lengthy English-language letter. “Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,” the Taliban said in the lengthy English-language letter.

The Taliban told US President Donald Trump in an open letter on Tuesday that the military situation in Afghanistan was “far worse than you realize”, and sending in more troops would be self-destructive. A senior Taliban official told Reuters the rare decision to address Trump directly was timed to coincide with the president’s deliberations on the future of US policy in Afghanistan. “Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,” the Taliban said in the lengthy English-language letter.

It criticized the Afghan government as “stooges”, “lying, corrupt leaders” and “repulsive sellouts” who were providing Washington with “rosy pictures” of the military position. The Taliban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, has waged an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led invasion after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Those attacks were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from a base in Afghanistan. “The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!” the letter said, arguing that the only thing preventing the Taliban from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.

The senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces. Influential voices including Republican Senator John McCain have also urged an “enduring” US military presence in Afghanistan.

But such plans have faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that the Trump administration was “very, very close” to a decision on Afghanistan, adding that all options were on the table. However, US officials believe it could take weeks for a South Asia strategy to be approved.

“We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,” the Taliban told Trump.

“A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.”

Some Taliban leaders disagreed with publishing the letter as they believe the group is close to being able to end the war on its own terms, while the “Americans are no longer in a position to fight this never-ending war,” one Taliban official said.

The first official said the Taliban was open to “discuss all issues with the United States for bringing peace to Afghanistan” if American troops are withdrawn. “Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,” the Taliban letter said. “The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.”

"Charlottesville Violence: ‘No place for violent racism, anti-Semitism,’ says UN chief","UN chief Antonio Guterres (File) UN chief Antonio Guterres (File)

UN chief Antonio Guterres has strongly condemned the violence targeting civilians in Charlottesville, saying there must be no place for racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia in the society.

Residents of in Charlottesville grappled with shock and fear following a day of violence when a car rammed into a crowd peacefully protesting against the rally by white supremacists, killing a 32-year-old woman.

“We are against all racism and bigotry. We believe that there must be no place in our societies for the violent racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and discrimination that we have seen in Charlottesville, Virginia, in recent days,” UN Secretary General’s Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters here yesterday.

Haq was responding to a question on the Secretary General’s reaction to the white supremacist rally and the protest that followed in Charlottesville on Saturday.

Haq said the UN condemns any of the violence that affected civilians expressed condolences to the family and loved ones of the victims and those injured.

US President Donald Trump had come under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for his muted response to the violence unleashed by white supremacists during a rally in Charlottesville in which a woman was killed and 19 were injured when a car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville.

Manchester City out to show why they’re Premier League favourites,"Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero scored an impressive goal against Brighton Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero scored an impressive goal against Brighton

After a first week in the Premier League that saw the champions Chelsea toppled and 31 goals flying in, the victories by Manchester’s clubs on the opening weekend suggested they could be the teams to chase this term.

The rivals are book-ending week two, with United at Swansea City in Saturday’s lunchtime game and City testing Everton’s new big-spending resolve on Monday. That should provide an even better feel for their credentials.

Jose Mourinho’s United put four past West Ham United and Romelu Lukaku quickly demonstrated his intent to be crowned the league’s top scorer, after just missing out last year, with an accomplished double.

Just as impressive was the performance of Pep Guardiola’s City, who broke down the newcomers Brighton & Hove Albion with the pairing of Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus promising much.

German international Ilkay Gundogan is back in the frame for them, too, after a long-term injury as the summer’s 200 million-pound big spenders face an Everton side who have been splashing out again themselves by signing Gylfi Sigurdsson.

Still having to prove they have enough goals in them after the departure of Lukaku, manager Ronald Koeman declared on Wednesday that the Icelander is the man to “bring productivity” to the Toffees after Lukaku’s departure. The big question marks have all been down at Stamford Bridge this week following their home loss to Burnley.

They ended up with nine men and the first glimpse of deja vu for Blues faithful who can’t bring themselves to believe their title defence under Antonio Conte will go the same way as the last one, under Mourinho, two years ago. With injuries and suspensions to the dismissed Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas, a visit to old foes Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday is the sort of demanding follow-up Conte might have hoped to have been spared so early in the campaign. Yet could Spurs’ brave new world at Wembley Stadium, as they wait for their new White Hart Lane home to be finished, prove an Achilles heel? If their wretched Champions League experiences there last season are anything to go by, it could be.

Liverpool’s win in the Champions League qualifier at Hoffenheim was just the tonic they needed to forget the saga of whether Philippe Coutinho would stay or head for Barcelona. Instead, they could revel in home-grown teenager Trent Alexander-Arnold’s goal-scoring in Germany.

They now seek their first league win of the campaign against Crystal Palace, who were left reeling by a woeful debut under Frank De Boer in the 3-0 defeat at home to Huddersfield Town.

The Terriers, hardly able to credit such an emphatic victory in their first match in the top flight for 45 years – which saw them briefly top the table until Manchester United’s win – now have the chance to make it, in contrast, a pointless start for fellow newcomers Newcastle United at Kirklees Stadium. Arsenal visit Stoke City, so often a fixture with the feel of a proper culture clash, and they will be counting on new signing Alexandre Lacazette to hit the target again. Lacaztte scored after just 94 seconds of his debut in the 4-3 win over Leicester City.

Australia’s Crown says all staff held in China now free,"Australia’s foreign minister says Chinese authorities have released from jail a top Australian executive at a casino company following the completion of his sentence on gambling-related offenses. (Source: AP) Australia’s foreign minister says Chinese authorities have released from jail a top Australian executive at a casino company following the completion of his sentence on gambling-related offenses. (Source: AP)

Australia’s Crown Resorts said on Monday that China had released all of the casino group’s employees who were detained as part of a gambling crackdown last year. Mogul James Packer’s gaming company said the last of the 19 current and former Crown employees had been set free after being held for 10 months.

“Crown is pleased that all of our employees have now been released and reunited with their families and loved ones,” executive chairman John Alexander said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the employees whose sentences ended on Saturday were expelled from the country the same day. “We hope relevant countries can inculcate their citizens living in China to conscientiously abide by laws and regulations and not be engaged in illegal activities,” Hua told reporters.

The 19 defendants had pleaded guilty at a Shanghai court in June and 16 of them, including three Australians, were given sentences of between nine and 10 months in jail. The sentence included time served since they were arrested last October.

Three who were granted bail in November were not jailed.

Jason O’Connor, the executive vice president of Crown division VIP International in charge of luring rich Chinese to Australia, had been given a 10-month jail term and a two million yuan (USD 292,000) fine.

The two other Australians, Pan Dan and Jerry Xuan, were given nine-month sentences and 400,000 yuan (USD 58,000) and 200,000 yuan (USD 29,000) fines, respectively. The executives were accused of breaching local anti-corruption laws by organising banned gambling activities overseas for wealthy Chinese.

The episode prompted a major restructuring at Crown, which runs its flagship casino in Melbourne and is also developing a large gaming resort in Sydney. With revenues from Chinese high rollers waning, Crown last year sold its stake in Macau’s Melco joint venture and shelved plans for a Las Vegas casino, concentrating instead on its Australian operations.

Saina Nehwal all set to make a comeback in World Championship,"Saina Nehwal won the Malaysia Masters in January. (Source: File) Saina Nehwal won the Malaysia Masters in January. (Source: File)

Saina Nehwal has been struggling with her form since she won a silver at the World Championship in 2015. However, former chief National coach Vimal Kumar feels that the absence from all the spotlight might prove beneficial for her in the upcoming World Championship tournament in Glasgow.

In an interview to PTI, Saina’s coach Vimal said, “After the knee injury, she was struggling, she lost some close matches. She has put in some good effort and if she can play to her potential then it is possible to beat the top players. Also this time, the focus is not on her. The limelight is all on (PV) Sindhu and (K) Srikanth and that is a good thing.”

Saina suffered a knee injury during last year’s Olympics and since then she has been struggling with her form. She won the Malaysia Masters in January, which was her first title after coming back from the injury, but still, she has not been able to reach her peak till now. With a dip in form, it also became a tough task for the Indian shuttler to win some close matches against her opponents.

Ahead of the World Championships, starting on August 21, all focus would be on the two Super Series titles winner Kidambi Srikant as he will be India’s biggest hope for the title.

Apart from Srikanth, B Sai Praneeth and P V Sindhu has also won a Super Series title each. Sai Praneeth clinched a title at the Singapore Open, while India Open saw PV Sindhu’s magic.

Vimal said that Saina’s form is no more a matter of concern. “It happens in individual sports and all the girls are also improving, they are all young girls, against whom she has been playing. Whether it is (Nitchaon) Jindapol or Busanan (Ongbumrungpan), they also went on to beat Akane Yamaguchi or Tai Tzu (Ying), who are in the top 5, so they have similar standards and on their day they can beat each other.”

Saina will play against the winner of the match between Switzerland’s Sabrina Jaquet and Ukraine’s Natalya Voytsekh, as she got a buy in the opening round. She might have to face Korea’s second ranked Sung Ji Hyun, to make her way through to the pre-quarterfinals.

Expressing his views about the draw, Vimal said: “It is a tough draw but it is a doable one. This particular girl, Sung Ji Hyun is world no 2 and Saina has beaten her in the Australian Open, so lots of positives and I am hopeful of her putting up a good show.

He added: “Saina will be playing Sung Ji if she wins against the Swiss girl in the first round. So it would be an interesting game.”

During the India Open Saina had said that she was still facing problems regarding her injury as her knee caused pain at times, adding that she fears her injury might crop up again, to which Vimal opined, “I can’t see any issues. Of course, you will have some small niggles and all sports persons go through such phase but nothing major. Last few weeks she has been putting in some good work and so there are no issues. But you never know it can happen in tough matches. But as of now, I don’t see any issues.”

"LFW W/F 2017: Ritu Kumar, Masaba, Sanjay Gupta and highlights from Day 1","Day 1 of the Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 started off with a bang with key designers such as Ritu Kumar, Masaba and Sanjay Garg presenting their collections. The young crop, though, kicked-off the fashion week with stunning silhouttes and concepts. There was some Bollywood bling as well, with Sonal Chauhan and Sayani Gupta acting as showstoppers for designers Sonal Verma and Shweta Kapur of the brand 431-88, respectively. Disha Patani walked for veteran Ritu Kumar, looking drop-dead gorgeous.

Sumiran Kabir Sharma, one of the Gen Next designers at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter/Festive 2017, displayed a line-up that was more than just ""beautiful dresses"" here on Wednesday. Sharma, the creative director of the brand Anaam, says his line was inspired by the red light area of Sonagachi and he wanted to focus attention on social issues like child abuse and women's trafficking through his clothes.

Day one of LFW started with the Gen Next show, where apart from brand Anaam, four other brands showcased their designs. The other new faces were (from left) Akshat Bansal, Deepak Pathak, Shenali Sema N' Rinzin Lama and Saaksha Parekh and Kinnari Kamat. They displayed varied designs, some of which were in asymmetrical patterns focussing on knots, while others displayed black as their theme in different patterns.

Sonal Chauhan and Sayani Gupta were the showstoppers for designers Sonal Verma and Shweta Kapur of the brand 431-88, respectively.

Disha Patani looked radiant as she walked down the ramp for designer Ritu Kumar on the first day of Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. The actor wore a beautiful, breezy outfit with bright floral embroidery on it. We love how the designer added a touch of modern element to the look while retaining the feminine elegance with the ruffle work. It's kind of unusual to mix a corset top, shorts and a sheer dress together to create an outfit, but it's ace designer Ritu Kumar we are talking about. We thinks she pulled it off beautifully. The stylists did a brilliant job too by giving Patani lovely tousled hair and sun-kissed make-up. (Source: Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Aimed at the destination wedding in the tropics for the millennial bride’s trousseau, Masaba Gupta presented her bridal collection inspired by Himalayan Orchard Pure. It was an amalgamation of colour, silhouettes and prints for a variety of global buyers. The stellar line which was showcased at the fashion week was designed for every millennial bride using accents of orchard gardens, linear grass prints and floral buds in fluid strokes.

The fruity colours of apple, strawberry and peach were the colour story which Masaba used to create her vibrant collection. Clumps of earthy foliage suspended from the ceiling and on the ramp set the mood for the vibrant show and created a perfect orchard ambience. The shade card matched the richness of the inspiration as pink tones; light peach, grass green, sun yellow balanced the blues with rich shades of berry, ivory and hints of gold and silver touches.

The Sakalava tribe face paintings, rich flora, fauna and garments of Madagascar, Masaba turned them into a print story. In addition the designer played with paintings, figure murals, linear grass prints, abstract foliage and birds that were turned into rich colour pigments and digital prints. Saris were deconstructed and worn with sharply cut trousers but slip dresses appeared with fluid throws. For a more prèt offering blazer maxis, asymmetric kurtas and flared palazzos completed the look.

Kurtas were draped or layered, while polo neck long-sleeved Tees were worn with drop-crotch pants. A trapeze tunic and sharara, mini with poncho cover and the grand maroon gown with a gorgeous floor skimming cape were eye-catching entries. Corsets appeared with saris, skirts and dresses to highlight the moulding and contouring nature of the collection. The silhouettes were daring and indeed contemporary as flowing anarkalis swirled on the ramp with attached capes and corsets. Clouded silk dresses were detailed with knotted seams. Making a flamboyant entry were the bow tops, teamed with drop crotch dhotis; while patchwork capes added to the vibrant appeal of the collection.

Sanjay Garg unveiled a celestial collection at the Grand Opening Night show at Day 1 of Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Presented at the exquisite Royal Opera House, the city’s premiere heritage site.

Garg’s designs were synonymous with the innocent purity and bliss that angels represent. The intricate details revealed soft feathers and scalloped clouds of angels in flight which were made in handcrafted Chikankari on Bengal mul, zardozi and hand-woven brocade.

The angelic motifs, floral prints and geometric figures gave a serene and other-worldly aura to the whole collection."
Disobeying summons issued by an investigating agency a criminal offence: SC,"The bench passed the judgement on an appeal filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenging the high court order. The bench passed the judgement on an appeal filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenging the high court order.

Disobeying summons issued by an investigating agency under the money laundering law amounts to a criminal offence, the Supreme Court held today. The apex court’s order came as it set aside a Karnataka High Court order which had held that disobedience of summons for appearance did not amount to contravention of the provisions of the 1963 Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA).

“In any event, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained as it is contrary to the law laid down by this court,” a bench of justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao said.

The bench passed the judgement on an appeal filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenging the high court order. The trial court had dismissed a complaint by ED and acquitted one Mohammed Akram under the FERA. It was alleged in the complaint that Banglore-based M/s Pheroze Framrose, an authorised money changer, indulged in releasing substantial foreign exchange in contravention of the law.

The agency alleged that two employees of the firm were summoned during the enquiry and they admitted that foreign exchange worth Rs 50 crore was released on the basis of bogus documents by the money changer. Summons were issued under Section 40 of FERA in October 1997 directing Akram and two others to appear before ED officer, but they had failed to respond. Thereafter, a complaint was filed against them in a court in Bangalore where Akram was represented in the proceedings by an advocate. The lower court, however, acquitted him and directed the other two to face the trial.

The trial court had held that the summons issued by ED were not duly served on the respondent personally and the refusal to appear before the enforcement officer in spite of summons under the provision of FERA, cannot be regarded as a contravention of the Act. Challenging the trial court’s order, the agency moved the high court which also dismissed its appeal.

The apex court, however, said “the question of service under Section 40(3) of FERA, 1973 not being effected on the respondent is irrelevant at this point of time as he was represented by an advocate before the trial court. It appears that the respondent is not interested in these proceedings.”

The apex court set aside the high court order and allowed the agency’s appeal.

Israel destroys home of Palestinian who killed officer,"Israel’s military says forces have demolished the home of a Palestinian involved in attacks that killed a young female police officer in Jerusalem. It said troops early Thursday destroyed the West Bank residence of one of the attackers. Palestinians armed with an automatic weapon and knives assaulted officers on duty near Jerusalem’s Old City in June. Staff Sgt. Maj. Hadas Malka, 23, was rushing to respond to the initial attack when a Palestinian assaulted her with a knife.

Israel says the demolitions are an effective deterrent. Critics say it amounts to collective punishment. Since 2015, Palestinians have killed 48 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist in stabbings, shooting and car-ramming attacks. In that time, Israeli forces killed over 255 Palestinians, most said by Israel to be attackers.

"Problem in protecting India’s wetlands: Technically, there aren’t any to protect","The small portion of the sprawling site of the World Culture Festival on the Yamuna floodplains is seen on March 14, 2016, the day after the Festival ended. The pontoon bridge built across the stream is in the middle of the image.

The pontoon bridge built across the stream is in the middle of the image. Express photo by Ravi Kanojia

Last week, during the hearing of the case against Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living (AoL) Foundation at the National Green Tribunal (NGT), counsel for AoL brought up the concept of wetlands in India.

“The report repeatedly uses the expression ‘wetlands’,” he said to a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar. “In fact, there are no wetlands. The Ramsar Convention does not enlist this (the Yamuna floodplains) as a wetland and it cannot be termed as such under law.”

AoL faces accusations of ravaging the Yamuna floodplains in Delhi, where it organised a World Culture Festival over three days in March 2016. In a 31-page report submitted in April 2017, a seven-member panel of experts appointed by the NGT to assess the damage referred, on at least 10 separate occasions, to the “wetlands” on the floodplains.

AoL’s argument is not isolated. The NGT is currently hearing 18 other cases in which “wetlands” are the centre of contention.

***

Wetlands are nature’s “kidneys” that “purify the system”, said Rahul Kaul, Chief Ecologist with the Noida-based nature conservation non-profit Wildlife Trust of India. “Certain wetlands, like the ones in Kashmir, have a regulatory role — they control floods. They absorb water when the levels are high, release it in times of drought,” Kaul said.

In 1982, India became a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, 1971, an intergovernmental treaty aimed at the “conservation and wise use of wetlands”, thus committing itself to protecting wetlands in a “wide variety of habitats, such as rivers and lakes, coastal lagoons, mangroves, coral reefs, and numerous man-made wetlands”.

In 2010, the central government notified The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules (amended in 2016), which noted that as “vital parts of the hydrological cycle, (wetlands) are highly productive, support exceptionally large biological diversity and provide a wide range of ecosystem services, such as waste assimilation, water purification, flood mitigation, erosion control, groundwater recharge, micro climate regulation…”

According to The Convention on Wetlands signed in Ramsar, Iran, wetlands “include a wide variety of habitats such as marshes, peatlands, floodplains, rivers and lakes, and coastal areas such as salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds, but also coral reefs and other marine areas no deeper than six metres at low tide, as well as human-made wetlands such as waste-water treatment ponds and reservoirs”.

The 2010 Rules laid down an equally comprehensive definition: “an area or of marsh, fen, peatland or water; natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres and includes all inland waters such as lakes, reservoir, tanks, backwaters, lagoon, creeks, estuaries and man-made wetland and the zone of direct influence on wetlands, that is to say the drainage area or catchment region of the wetlands as determined by the authority, but does not include main river channels, paddy fields and the coastal wetland…”

Environmentalist Anand Arya, a petitioner in a Supreme Court case on wetlands, said: “There is no doubt about how to define a wetland. If anyone says they don’t know the definition, they are pulling a fast one.”

***

But AoL is making a technical argument. “Wetlands needs to be preserved everywhere in India, whether coastal, riverine or inland,” said a spokesperson. However, wetlands are only “whatever is notified by the authority under the wetland rules, and if it’s not notified it can never be called a wetland”, the spokesperson said.

At the heart of AoL’s argument in the NGT is this crucial catch: not a single wetland in India has been notified by the government as yet. This is in spite of the existence of specific Rules, since 2010, on how to identify wetlands and how to prepare “Brief Documents”.

“Currently, there are 7,57,000 wetlands in India,” Arya said. “The Supreme Court has extended protection to 2,01,503 of these, which occupy 95% of the wetland area.” Each of these wetlands is spread over more than 2.25 hectares. The 2,01,503 wetlands were listed in the National Wetland Inventory & Assessment prepared by ISRO’s Space Applications Centre for the Environment Ministry in 2011, when Jairam Ramesh was Minister.

“As a first step, the ‘Brief Documents’ with regard to these wetlands should be obtained by the Union of India from the respective State Governments in terms of Rule 6 of the Wetland Rules, 2010,” the Supreme Court said in its February 2017 order.

The ‘brief documents’ include, according to guidelines issued by the Ministry in 2010, “broad geographical delineation of the wetland; its zone of influence along with a map; the size of the wetland; account of pre-existing rights and privileges, consistent or not consistent with the ecological health of the wetland”.

Yet, the Supreme Court noted, “many of these proposals/brief documents” received from the states “contain deficiencies”. In the case of Uttar Pradesh, for instance, which sent 542 brief documents for review, the Centre said maps were “not legible, accurate or, to scale”, delineation of boundary and its zone of influence and GPS coordinates were not given, and the proposal was not in conformity with the 2010 Rules. Identical problems were noted for the five proposals that Delhi sent.

“At the Eastern Zonal Bench of the NGT in Kolkata, counsel representing a state said that he was waiting for the water to drain before measuring the wetland,” advocate in the NGT, Ritwick Dutta, said. “He completely missed the point of a wetland.”

***

As part of its February 2017 order, the Supreme Court directed that the amendment to the 2010 Rules — the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2016 — be notified on or before June 30. This deadline was missed — and on Wednesday, when the matter came up in the Supreme Court, the court gave the government time until September 30 to notify the Rules, and asked it to make an inventory of wetlands that have already vanished from among the 2,01,503 identified in the 2011 Inventory.

Environmentalists, however, say the 2016 Rules have diluted the spirit of the 2010 original. For instance, the national-level Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority (CWRA) has been done away with entirely.

“Ideally, there should be a CWRA to guide the process. There is need to develop a standard list of activities not be taken up at wetlands in general, besides restricting or banning site-specific activities,” said an environmentalist who did not wish to be named. The mechanism to “push and prod” state governments to complete the process in a “time-bound manner” has been done away with, complained activists.

Environmentalist Pushp Jain, who has gone to the Green Tribunal against inadequate implementation of the 2010 Rules, said despite the Supreme Court’s order, “nobody has bothered” to begin the process of identifying wetlands, since “nobody realises the implication”.

It is now up to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to “write to all states and Union Territories as per the SC’s order and ensure that the Wetland Rules are implemented”, Jain said.

“We have a little more than 5% of (India’s total) geographical area occupied by wetlands,” said Arya. “And as India grows, we need fresh water.”

Biggest Bollywood hits of 2017 so far,"With Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, Akshay Kumar has proved that he has got what it takes to pull audiences to the theaters. The unconventional love story of Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar) and Keshav (Akshay Kumar) with Toilet being the villain of their fairy tale is running to packed houses after the disheartening fate of Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma starrer Jab Harry Met Sejal. Within five days of its release, the film, which highlights the issue of open defecation in India, has managed to mint Rs 83.45 crore. With such good numbers, this is Akshay's second film after Jolly LLB 2 to be in the top 10 openers of 2017.

Earlier in the year Baahubali: The Conclusion created a storm with its record-breaking collection of Rs 510.98 crore in India. But before Baahubali 2, it was Shah Rukh Khan's Republic Day release Raees which minted Rs 137.51 crore despite a clash with Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil. Raees is the second highest earner of the year until now.

Well, Salman Khan also failed to spell his charm on the moviegoers as his much-awaited Eid release Tubelight tanked at the box office. The actor, who failed to impress the audience with his good-boy image, admitted that he never expected a positive review from film critics. In fact, the film also failed to touch the 120-crore mark and raked in only Rs 119.26 crore.

The court room drama Jolly LLB 2 starring Akshay Kumar and Huma Qureshi entered the 100-crore club with its total collection of Rs 117 crore.

Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt once again won hearts with their quirky yet simple love story, Badrinath Ki Dulhania. The film was applauded by the critics and audiences alike. The film, which released in March, earned Rs 116.68 crore.

Hrithik Roshan's blind act in Kaabil did bring him appreciation but the film was overpowered by SRK's Raees. It minted Rs. 103.84 crore.

Irrfan Khan starrer Hindi Medium proved to be an underdog as despite a slow start the film managed to earn Rs 69.59 crore. The film was made on a modest budget of Rs 22 crores.

Despite his stature in the domestic as well as international market, Shah Rukh Khan failed to impress his massive fan following with Imtiaz Ali's directorial Jab Harry Met Sejal. The film was panned by critics and audiences alike. Despite many unique and interesting promotional gimmicks, the film earned only Rs. 62.60 crore, which is something unexpected from a Shah Rukh Khan starrer.

Despite a decent opening on its release date and a good collection through the weekend, Jagga Jasoos failed to do an impressive job at the box office. The Ranbir Kapoor-Katrina Kaif starrer collected Rs 54.16 crore in India.

Anil Kapoor and his nephew Arjun Kapoor succeeded in tickling the funny bone of the audience with their perfect comic timing in Mubarakan. The movie earned Rs 51.55 crore. Though the film, made on a budget of Rs 55 crore, got a slow opening, it picked up at the box office due to positive word-of-mouth.

The 'lady-oriented' Lipstick Under My Burkha amid competition from other big banner movies managed to perform well at the box office. It earned Rs 18.87 crore. The film starring Konkona Sensharma and Ratna Pathak Shah was made on a budget of Rs 6 crores."
"Karnataka gets Indira Canteens: Breakfast for Rs 5, lunch for Rs 10","Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah eat at the newly launched Indira Canteen in Bengaluru on Wednesday. PTI Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah eat at the newly launched Indira Canteen in Bengaluru on Wednesday. PTI

KARNATAKA CHIEF Minister Siddaramaiah and the Congress used the opening of the first batch of 198 low-cost food canteens, called Indira Canteens and modelled on the Amma canteens for the poor in Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday as a virtual platform to launch the party’s campaign for the Assembly elections scheduled early next year.

The Indira Canteens are aimed at the working class in Bengaluru who struggle to eat two square meals every day, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said, after eating at the canteen. “There are millions of people, like construction workers, those who own small shops, autorickshaw or taxi drivers, barbers and others who do not earn much much money. This Indira Canteen is for them,’’ he said. “I am proud to say that we have been able to ensure that in the coming months, no poor person will stay hungry.”

“Even BJP leaders who are criticising these efforts will stand in line for the food because it is of high quality. They cannot complain if we are filling the stomachs of the poor,” Rahul said.

Siddaramaiah said the BJP is raising opposition to the Indira Canteens because they are opposed to the poor. “Those who go hungry every day because they cannot afford food will understand the value of these canteens,” he said.

He accused BJP national president Amit Shah, who recently visited the state, of spreading lies about the Congress government. “He employs criminal tactics to fight the opposition. He does not know how to work within the confines of the law and the Constitution,” Siddaramaiah said.

The Indira Canteens in 198 wards of Bengaluru are being set up in properties belonging to the city corporation. The Chief Minister has denied accusations that land identified for parks and playgrounds were being utilised to build the canteens.

In the first phase on Wednesday, 101 canteens were launched and another 97 are set to be launched on October 2. A total of 27 kitchens are being established around Bengaluru by the Mangalorean origin catering contract firm Cheftalk Food and Hospitality Services. The canteens will serve breakfast for

Rs 5 and lunch, dinner for Rs 10. Each of the canteens is meant to serve 500 people at every meal, according to city officials.

The Siddaramaiah government is projecting the Indira Canteens as a flagship programme of the party alongside populist schemes such as the distribution of seven kg of foodgrains free of cost to every member of a poor family and free milk for schoolchildren, introduced by the Congress government at the start of its tenure in May 2013.

Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-0 without Cristiano Ronaldo to win Spanish Super Cup,"Real Madrid completed a 5-1 aggregate against Barcelona to win Spanish Super Cup. (Source: AP) Real Madrid completed a 5-1 aggregate against Barcelona to win Spanish Super Cup. (Source: AP)

Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-0 to complete a 5-1 victory on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday, dominating its fiercest rival without the need of Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale.

Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema provided the goals in the second leg for a Madrid side that showed every ounce of confidence that Barcelona sorely lacked.

While Bale was rested on the bench, Ronaldo watched the game from the Santiago Bernabeu stands as he completed the first game of a five-match ban for pushing the referee who sent him off in Sunday’s 3-1 first-leg win.

Asensio filled in perfectly for Madrid’s star, scoring five minutes into the match for his second goal in the season’s curtain raiser. Benzema added a second goal in the 39th after Lucas Vazquez had already hit the post for the hosts.

Last season’s Liga and Champions League winners, Madrid also beat Manchester United to win the European Super Cup last week.

“We played very well in the away leg and we had a great game tonight, above all in the first half, which was spectacular,” Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. “We have to congratulate the players because they were fantastic. You couldn’t notice the changes (to the starting lineup).”

Barcelona struggled to score for a second match since the shocking departure of Neymar on a world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. The closest it went to scoring was Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez hitting the woodwork in the second half after the title was already in Madrid’s grasp.

After seeing his team be soundly beaten on its home pitch in his debut with the team on Sunday, Barcelona’s new coach Ernesto Valverde decided to revamp both his starting 11 and its formation.

He ditched Barcelona’s classic 4-3-3 formation for a 3-5-2, with only Messi and Suarez up front. Neymar had accompanied them for the past four seasons before he bolted for PSG.

Valverde also gave starts to midfielders Andre Gomes and Sergi Roberto and defender Javier Mascherano, in place of Sunday’s starters Aleix Vidal, Gerard Deulofeu and the injured Andres Iniesta. It didn’t matter.

Barcelona had no answer for Madrid’s pressure, lost ball after ball in its own half, and clearly missed Neymar’s presence on the left flank to start quick attacks.

“They showed more energy in their pressure and we suffered when they recovered the ball,” Valverde said. “It’s obvious that we have to recover our spirit quickly.”

The only bright spot on another long night for Barcelona was the positive contribution of Roberto, who provided the only consistent attacking spark besides Messi.

Zidane also rested Francisco “Isco” Alarcon and Casemiro, who went on late. Luka Modric was back from suspension and outplayed all of Barcelona’s midfielders.

Asensio picked up right where he had left the first leg, stunning goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a long strike that floated overhead before landing in the net.

Asensio earned a place in Zidane’s starting 11 after going on as a substitute on Sunday and capping Madrid’s victory by scoring a 90th-minute goal with a long shot that Ter Stegen failed to stop.

The 21-year-old forward started the second leg with a similar superb strike, bending a left-footed shot from well outside the area over a flatfooted Ter Stegen.

Messi needed over 10 minutes to finally touch the ball, and once he did Barcelona showed signs of life with two Messi-led attacks that made Madrid work in defense.

But despite having five midfielders, Barcelona never established control. A bad pass by Mascherano almost led to a goal from Vazquez, who hit the post in the 33rd.

That was just a warning of was about to come when Sergio Busquets lost another ball near Barcelona’s area. Madrid left back Marcelo pounced by sending a low cross into the area, when Benzema twisted around Samuel Umtiti and swept in his goal.

It took almost an hour for Messi to finally produced Barcelona’s first serious threat when he forced Keylor Navas to palm his shot onto the bar in the 53rd.

Suarez headed a rebound of Messi’s strike parried by Navas off the upright in the 71st. The striker finished the match favoring his right knee after running into Navas.

Madrid starts its defense of its Spanish league title on Sunday at Deportivo La Coruna, while Barcelona will try to rebound at home against Real Betis.

"Growth, inflation to trend higher in next 6-12 months: Nomura","The wholesale inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July from 0.90 per cent in June 2017. The wholesale inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July from 0.90 per cent in June 2017.

Economic growth and inflation are expected to trend higher in the next 6-12 months and the Reserve Bank is likely to stay on a prolonged pause, says a Nomura report. According to the Japanese financial services major, the MPC minutes suggest low inflation and growth concerns led to policy easing earlier this month, and going ahead the RBI is expected to stay on hold.

Most MPC members voted for a rate cut in August owing to low inflation momentum and signs of weaker growth. However, a neutral policy stance was retained owing to expectations of a higher inflation trajectory in coming days, the report noted.

According to Nomura, July inflation data confirmed that inflation troughed in June, and going ahead inflation is expected to see an uptrend due to rebound in vegetable prices. Moreover, GST has also resulted in a slightly faster pace of core inflation momentum.

“Most MPC members highlighted upside risks from the implementation of house rent allowance (HRA) increases, fiscal impulses such as farm loan waivers, proximity to 2019 elections, the recent uptick in inflation expectations, rising vegetable prices and the impact of GST,” Nomura said.

The wholesale inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July from 0.90 per cent in June 2017, mainly on account of turnaround in prices of food articles, especially vegetables. Retail inflation jumped to 2.36 per cent in the month, chiefly driven by hardening of prices of sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants.

“In view of the recent data on inflation and the neutral bias of most MPC members, we expect the RBI to stay on hold in October likely with a 5-1 vote,” the report said.

Enter Mercer Mann, a pretty and debt-ridden young novelist. Will she be the bait or is Cable not the man behind the heist after all?

Book: Camino island

Author: John Grisham

Publication: Hodder & Stoughton

Pages: 400

Price: Rs 399

In the flaky firmament of “bestsellers” and “pacy reads”, John Grisham has arguably been as steady as the northern star, when it comes to legal thrillers. Now he’s back with Camino Island, his latest. But get this: Camino Island’s intrigue unspools in a Florida beach town and the core premise revolves around rare books.

A departure from the usual lawyer-setting, Grisham’s book remains taut as ever right from the get-go: the story starts with an incredible heist at Princeton University’s Firestone Library — original manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s works such as The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night are stolen.The FBI gets on board. A security firm, working for Princeton’s insurance company, thinks it has a lead in an obvious target: an eminent bookstore owner named Bruce Cable with a shady history and a penchant for philandering like his life depended on it. But they need an insider. Enter Mercer Mann, a pretty and debt-ridden young novelist. Will she be the bait or is Cable not the man behind the heist after all?

"AAP, Cong say Gorakhpur children deaths will change narrative in poll-bound Bawana","CM Arvind Kejriwal during a rally in Bawana. Express photo by Gajendra Yadav CM Arvind Kejriwal during a rally in Bawana. Express photo by Gajendra Yadav

The Gorakhpur hospital tragedy, leaders of the AAP and the Congress believe, will convince voters in poll-bound Bawana to not vote from the BJP. As distant as the connection may be, the purvanchali voters in the area, leaders of the two parties believe, are affected by what happens in Uttar Pradesh. Senior AAP leaders conceded that the mood after the BJP’s win in Uttar Pradesh Assembly was an important factor that sealed BJP’s victory in Delhi’s municipal polls.

Bypoll in Bawana — necessitated after current MLA Ved Prakash resigned AAP and joined BJP — is scheduled for August 23.

Conversations in Bawana now revolve around the deaths of over a 100 children in Gorakhpur. Anil Sharma, a resident of Bawana and a BJP supporter, explained, “The area has a lot of people who are from eastern UP, and this is something they feel strongly about.”

The issues on which the polls are being contested in Bawana are varied. In the rural parts, the demand for water for irrigation is intense.

Elsewhere, in Shahbad Dairy for instance, residents speak of inadequate health facilities. “Health and education are big issues. There have been improvement in schools, but hospitals don’t have enough doctors,” said Mohammed Ahmed, another resident.

Former MLA Ved Prakash said, “In the three mohalla clinics, there are insufficient medicines and standards are not up to the mark. The 150-bed hospital has a staff shortage of 14 per cent, at least 60 per cent nurses are on contract basis and there are insufficient beds. The AAP is to blame for this because they didn’t allow me to work.” AAP’s counter to the allegation is “why did you leave if so much had to be done”.

But it is in these colonies, said a BJP leader, that the impact of Gorakhpur would be felt most keenly. “If you look at AAP, they are focusing on the Purvanchali vote. The leaders coming here, like Gopal Rai, are from the area, who is also the candidate,” the BJP leader said. However, officially, the BJP maintained otherwise. “What happened in Gorakhpur is tragic and the BJP government will take prompt action. But what about the tragic deaths of DJB workers, which has happened in AAP’s backyard. Why are they not taking any action?” said BJP leader Arvinder Singh Lovely.

“There are still eight days for the polls. But yes, the incident has exposed the BJP,” said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson.

Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken added, “The Congress is seeking votes on the basis of development work. But the other parties have only indulged in publicity stunts in the last three years.”

LeBron James blasts Donald Trump amid Charlottesville violence; calls him ‘so-called President’,"LeBron James took a direct dig at United States President Donald Trump after violent clashes in Charlottesville. (Source: AP) LeBron James took a direct dig at United States President Donald Trump after violent clashes in Charlottesville. (Source: AP)

NBA star LeBron James didn’t mince any words as he went after United States President Donald Trump in calling him “so-called president” while calling for unity amid the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia with groups attacking each other in an extreme case of racism.

After a day long event at Cedar Point Amusement Park on Tuesday, LeBron stood in front of students, parents and families connected to his foundation. He asked to take a moment to address the violent clashes where a woman was killed amid ugly clashes between far-right extremists and the protesters.

“I know there’s a lot of tragic things happening in Charlottesville (Virginia),” James said. “I just want to speak on it right now. I have this platform and I’m somebody that has a voice of command and the only way for us to get better as a society and for us to get better as people is love. And that’s the only way we’re going to be able to conquer something as one. It’s not about the guy that’s the so-called president of the United States, or whatever the case.”

It came just hours after the Cleveland Cavaliers player took to Twitter following Trump’s comments where he seemed to equate the actions of white supremacists with those who were protesting against them.

Hate has always existed in America. Yes we know that but Donald Trump just made it fashionable again! Statues has nothing to do with us now! — LeBron James (@KingJames) 15 August 2017

James went on to say, “It’s not about a teacher that you don’t feel like cares about what’s going on with you every day,” James continued. “It’s not about people that you just don’t feel like want to give the best energy and effort to you. It’s about us. It’s about us looking in the mirror. Kids all the way up to the adults. All of us looking in the mirror and saying, ‘What can we do better to help change?’ And if we can all do that and give 110 percent, then that’s all you can ask for.

“So, shout out to the innocent people in Charlottesville (Virginia) and shout out to everybody across the world that just want to be great and just want to love. Thank you, and I love you all.”

Akash Saharan, Vivaan Kapoor and Janmajai Singh Rathore gave the Indian squad enough reason to smile as they stayed in contention for the final of the men’s trap shooting competition on day one of the ISSF Junior Shotgun World Cup at Porpetto in Italy on Thursday.

Akash shot rounds of 24 and 25 for a 49 out of 50 to lead the qualification standings out of 71 shooters. Vivaan and Janmajai totaled 46 each to stay in fourth and fifth places respectively. The top six make it to the final rounds.

Lakshay Sheoran was on 45 and in 12th place and three good rounds can also get him into contention while a fifth Indian in the fray, Manavaditya Singh Rathore shot 39 to lie in 43rd place.

The junior women’s team, however, fell short with two shooters — Nivetha Nenthirasigamani and Soumya Gupta — finishing six short of the final qualifying target to end at 12th and 13th respectively. They shot 56 out of 75 when 62 would have made them eligible for a finals shoot-off.

Manisha Keer finished 23rd on a score of 53 while Kirti Gupta ended 32nd with 51.

"‘Brilliant’ Virat Kohli’s style of captaincy similar to Ricky Ponting’s, says Mike Hussey","Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP) Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP)

Former Australia batsman Michael Hussey believes that Virat Kohli’s way of leading the side is similar to Ricky Ponting, in terms of aggression. “Kohli has been brilliant. I like the way he captains. I like his aggressive nature and his will to win. He had this desire to push his team as far as he could. He set very high standards during training and in the game. I do see some similarities with Ponting. The will to win, that competitiveness,” Hussey told PTI during an interaction.

Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month and according to Hussey, the series will be competitive. “It will be a good series hopefully. They play their one-day cricket well. They have some good players and have won some good (ODI) series here over the years, though not in the Tests. The key will be to not rely on any one player. It is not one person that is the key. Everyone needs to know what their job is and perform as well as they can,” said Hussey.

He feels that Team India’s confidence will be really high after whitewashing Sri Lanka 3-0 in the Test series, but an ODI series against Australia will be a different challenge for the hosts. “I am sure their confidence will be high after the Sri Lanka series. They also have an excellent limited-overs team. However, an ODI series against Australia is different,” he said.

Currently, Hussey is a part of the commentary team in the ongoing Tamil Nadu Premier League second season. He also expressed his views about the Australia captain Steve Smith, “Smith has been brilliant. He reads the game well. It obviously agreed with his own batting. Since he has been captain, his form has been incredible as well. He has been an excellent captain as well,” the former CSK player said.

He reserved special praise for Washington Sundar, saying that the youngster is very talented, “Sundar is talented, looks a very good player and KB Arun Karthik is a nice player too, bats very well. The TNPL is bringing to the fore some good cricketers, who can go on to play in the IPL and for India too.”

Hussey is also very excited to see Chennai Super Kings’ comeback for the next year’s IPL, he said, “I am very excited about CSK being back. I have great memories (of CSK) as a player. Love the franchise. There will be challenges with the team coming back after two years out.”

On being asked if he is interested in coaching CSK, next year, he said, “I loved playing for the team. I have great friendships here and a strong rapport with CSK. If there is an opportunity, I would be very interested, for sure.”

Griogor Dimitrov sets up last-16 clash with Juan Del Potro at Cincinnati Open,"Next up for Grigor Dimitrov will be Juan Del Potro. (Source: Reuters) Next up for Grigor Dimitrov will be Juan Del Potro. (Source: Reuters)

Bulgarian seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov beat Feliciano Lopez 7-6(5) 6-4 at the Cincinnati Open on Wednesday to set up a last-16 clash with Juan Martin Del Potro.

Dimitrov, who beat Lopez in the second round here last year, nearly broke the unseeded Spaniard three times prior to making a strong start in the tiebreak and went on to finish the match with 27 winners.

“Early on, he was serving very well,” said Dimitrov. “It was just important for me to stay in the game and just put as many returns in as I could in order to get in the rally because as soon as that was happening I felt I had a pretty good chance of winning every point.”

Next up for Dimitrov will be Del Potro, who is playing at Cincinnati for the first time in four years, after reaching the semi-finals in 2012 and 2013.

The 28-year-old Argentine booked his spot in the next round with a 6-4 6-4 win over Mitchell Krueger, breaking the American qualifier at the end of both sets to wrap up victory in one hour, 40 minutes.

Del Potro, who on Tuesday upset 10th-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych, also saved five break points at 3-3 in the second set and clinched his 18th victory of the year on his fourth match point.

Dimitrov has not beaten Del Potro in five career meetings, with the most recent defeat coming at Rome in May.

Australian Nick Kyrgios beat Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 7-6(6) to reach the third round, where he will face unseeded Croatian Ivo Karlovic.

Also advancing to the round of 16 were Spaniards David Ferrer and Pablo Carreno Busta and Russian Karen Khachanov.

Top-seeded Spaniard Rafa Nadal will cap off the evening session later on Wednesday when he meets Frenchman Richard Gasquet at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

"Mutual funds pump Rs 30,000-crore into stock markets in April-July","Representational purpose. Representational purpose.

Mutual funds managers pumped more than Rs 30,000 crore in the stock markets during April-July of the current fiscal due to strong participation from retail investors. In comparison, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought equities worth 21,000 crore during the period under review. “We have been witnessing a shift in investment towards equity class as investment avenues like real estate and gold are not doing well,” Vidya Bala, head mutual fund research at FundsIndia.com said. Besides, domestic fund inflows have been looking at the long-term story. Also, they are buoyed by continued strong inflows from retail investors, she added.

“The rally in stock markets was the primary reasons for the robust inflows in equities,” Bajaj Capital CEO Rahul Parikh said.

Besides, successful implementation of GST with no major business disruptions being reported, drove fund managers into equities, he added.

Mutual fund managers invested a net sum of Rs 30,264 crore in April-July period of the current financial year, as per data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

Month-wise, fund managers invested a net sum of Rs 11,244 crore in stock markets in April, Rs 9,358 crore in May, Rs 9,106 crore in June and Rs 11,800 crore in July.

The inflow is in line with BSE’s benchmark Sensex rising around 10 per cent during the first four months of the current financial year.

At present, the mutual fund industry is managing an asset base of about Rs 20 lakh crore mark.

Going ahead, fund houses are upbeat over the industry’s performance for the entire current fiscal, while expecting investment from new investors to fuel growth of the sector.

A mutual fund pools in assets of its investors and invests the money on their behalf. It provides diverse investment instruments like stocks and bonds without requiring investors to make separate purchases and trades.

Livestock trade: A business that has stalled,"A view of the cattle market at Loni in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. Express photo by Sandeep Daundkar A view of the cattle market at Loni in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. Express photo by Sandeep Daundkar

On August 14, Sandeep Jadhav joined protestors outside the Ahmednagar district collector’s office raising voices against the apparently growing attacks on gaurakshaks or so-called cattle protectors.

The trigger was an incident on August 6 evening, which saw an armed mob beating up 11 gaurakshaks on the Daund-Pune highway near Shrigonda in Ahmednagar. It happened after the cattle vigilantes, earlier in the day, had intercepted a truck carrying two cows and nine bullocks that were allegedly headed for illegal slaughter. The crowd, gathered under the banner of the Akhil Bhartiya Krishi Goseva Sangh (ABKGS), demanded action both against the perpetrators of the violence and the illegal slaughter activity that was supposedly still rampant in the area.

Jadhav’s being part of the protests had a tinge of irony. A livestock trader from Walki village in Ahmednagar, and mostly operating out of the cattle market at Loni in Rahata taluka of the same district, he has himself been at the receiving end of the gaurakshaks. “They stop trucks of even legally-traded cattle not going for slaughter and for which all the necessary documentation exists. Freeing the seized animals means paying bribes to both the gaurakshaks and the police,” he admits.

Only a couple of weeks ago, gaurakshaks impounded a consignment of eight indigenous Gir breed cows that Jadhav had sourced from a farmer in Gujarat’s Amreli district. These animals, whose milk fetches a premium, are currently being housed at a gaushala (cow shelter) near Amreli. “I paid over Rs 40,000 for each cow. Getting possession of them is going to be a huge challenge. There should be some mechanism where only those engaged in the illegal trade of animals for slaughter are severely dealt with. I totally support such action,” says Jadhav, explaining his participation in the ABKGS-organised demonstration.

Jadhav, who has been in the cattle trade business for two decades, is particularly concerned over the loss of farmer-customers from Gujarat. Prior to the spurt in gaurakshak vigilantism, especially over the last one year and more, he used to sell 35-40 lactating or pregnant cows (mostly Holstein Friesian crossbreds) every week. The buyers were mainly Gujarat farmers.

“Now, I barely do 5-10 animals a week. Farmers have stopped coming due to fear of their vehicles being waylaid by gaurakshaks. Transporters, too, are wary. Those who were charging around Rs 7,000, for hauling four animals on a small Tempo Traveller from Loni to Amreli, are today demanding twice that rate,” complains Jadhav.

His anxiety is shared by other traders of Loni, one of Maharashtra’s biggest cattle market. “Out of the 2,000-odd animals (almost entirely cows) that were traded every week here, a third was being bought by farmers from Valsad, Surat, Bharuch, and Narmada districts of Gujarat. These farmers, who get remunerative prices for the milk they supply to the cooperative unions there, normally purchase in bulk. But their numbers have dwindled to hardly 100 out of a total weekly trade of 600-700 now,” informs Subhash Mote, assistant secretary of the market that meets every Wednesday.

The impact of gaurakshak vigilantism is reflected in the Loni cattle market’s turnover, which recorded a dip from Rs 99.36 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 79.36 crore in 2016-17. Mote does not expect it to cross Rs 50 crore this financial year.

Heightened gaurakshak activism — and, of late, retaliation from a section of those whose business has taken a knock — is clearly linked to the Maharashtra government’s comprehensive ban on slaughter of all cattle, be it cows, bulls, bullocks or female and male calves.

Milind Ekbote, western Maharashtra head of ABKGS, takes significant credit for the effective implementation of the Devendra Fadnavis-led government’s amendment to the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act of 1976, which received presidential assent in March 2015.

“Our organisation is solely responsible for over 300 cases filed under the new legislation. The police are lethargic in taking action against butchers. Left to themselves, they would have done nothing,” he boasts.

Ekbote, who unsuccessfully contested the recent elections for the Pune Municipal Corporation on a Shiv Sena ticket, denies that ABKGS volunteers stop the transport of animals purchased for milking and breeding purposes. “We never do that. Our target is only illegal trade in cattle intended for slaughter,” he adds.

That claim, however, has few takers among farmers and livestock traders not just in Loni — which is strategically located for catering to buyers both from Gujarat and the adjoining Marathwada region within Maharashtra. A similar situation is being faced by traders in the cattle market of Miraj, a taluka town of southern Maharashtra’s Sangli district.

According to Prakash Patil, secretary of the Miraj market that trades 350-400 animals (both cattle and buffaloes) every week, over a quarter of his buyers come from Karnataka. The gaurakshaks, he states, frequent the market to “observe” the traders. In case someone is “suspected” of purchasing animals for slaughter, police cases are instantly slapped on them.

“We have stopped dealing altogether in old and infirm animals. For the gaurakshaks, any buyer of such animals is a potential cattle smuggler. That fact that Karnataka has no cattle slaughter ban in place does not help either,” he points out.

The ultimate loser isn’t just the market, which has registered a slide in turnover, but also the farmer who no longer has an avenue to dispose of animals that have ceased to give milk or be of use in farming operations.

15 held for heckling principal who hoisted flag wearing shoes,"The villagers told Yaquinuddin that while there may be no rule to remove shoes, it was a practice in the village and neighbouring areas to remove footwear before any auspicious event. The villagers told Yaquinuddin that while there may be no rule to remove shoes, it was a practice in the village and neighbouring areas to remove footwear before any auspicious event.

Fifteen villagers in Nizamabad district were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly heckling a college principal because he unfurled the national flag on Independence Day with his shoes on. On Tuesday morning, when Mohammed Yaquinuddin, the principal of Government Junior College at Ailapur village, stepped up to hoist the flag on the college campus, the sarpanch and several villagers asked him to remove his shoes.

The principal told them there was no such rule and that even armed forces officers unfurl the national flag while wearing shoes. He went ahead and hoisted the flag. However, as soon as the national anthem was over, a group of 15 youths started heckling Yaquinuddin, shouting “principal down down” and forced him out of the college gate.

The villagers told Yaquinuddin that while there may be no rule to remove shoes, it was a practice in the village and neighbouring areas to remove footwear before any auspicious event.

Yaquinuddin apologised and said he was unaware of the local customs and made peace with the villagers. A video of the incident which was shared on social media was held up by several Muslim organisations which urged him to lodge a police complaint.

“Principal Yaquinuddin lodged the complaint at Nandipet police station at 7 am on Wednesday. Based on his complaint we have arrested 15 youths of a local group called Seva Youth, comprising TRS, ABVP and Congress activists,” said Sub-Inspector of Nandipet Police Station, A Jana Reddy, who is the investigation officer.

Armoor area Circle Inspector Narasimha Swami, who is supervising the investigation, said: “They (the villagers) formed a chain around him and forced him out of the college campus gate while shouting,’’ Swami said.

Saiyeeda Shaikh, a resident of Nawab Kunta area, lodged the police complaint after her daughter called her from Oman on Wednesday and confided that she wants to return home as she was not liking it there. Saiyeeda stated that her husband Sikander had taken their daughter to his sister Ghousia’s house to stay for a few days.

“At her house, my husband and his sister hatched the plan to marry off my daughter to the sheikh from Oman. The sheikh paid Rs 5 lakhs to my husband. They kept me in the dark and secretly got her married at a function hall. They stayed for four days in a hotel and then he dropped her off at Ghousia’s house until her passport and visa was done then she too flew to Oman,’’ she stated in her complaint.

She said she spoke with the sheikh on phone and he told her he had “bought’’ her daughter from Sikander by paying Rs 5 lakhs. “My husband convinced my daughter to marry the sheikh by showing videos of luxurious life style in his villa in Oman. I did not want my daughter to get married so early. Now she does not want to stay there,’’ she said.

However, cops are not convinced with Saiyeeda’s version of the story. “She and her husband live separately but it is not possible that she did not know about her daughter’s marriage. Her daughter was away at her aunt’s house for nearly three months before getting married. We have called her husband and sister-in-law for inquiry. We are searching for the qazi who performed the marriage illegally,’’ Assistant Commissioner Mohammed Tajuddin said.

After initial inquiry cops found out that there was a dispute between Sikander and his estranged wife over sharing of money due to which she decided to lodge a police complaint. “Also have come to know that the Sheikh’s family is harassing her, trying all steps to ensure she is back in India. We will also take custody of the people who are directly and indirectly involved in this case,” V. Satyanarayana, DCP was quoted by ANI.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan or Alia Bhatt: Who wore the Roberto Cavalli denim jacket better?,"Alia Bhatt (L) and Aishwarya Rai in Roberto Cavalli. (Source: Varinder Chawla, Instagram/afashionistasdiaries) Alia Bhatt (L) and Aishwarya Rai in Roberto Cavalli. (Source: Varinder Chawla, Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

When it comes to non-fussy, girl-next-door fashion, Alia Bhatt takes the cake in Bollywood. We love how she adds oomph to a basic outfit with the right accessories or how she comes up with innovative ways to style her casuals. Also, denim is something she does really well. Take the instance when she attended Filmfare magazine editor Jitesh Pillai’s birthday party in a light and peachy lace yoke dress from Zadig and Voltaire that she paired with a denim jacket from Vero Moda. Acing her denim game once again is the Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor in a Roberto Cavalli jacket.

Bhatt was spotted at the airport keeping it casual yet chic in this floral print creation from Cavalli’s Spring 2017 collection. We like the way she styled it with a pair of simple denims, a pastel blue top, white sneakers and a yellow Anya Hindmarch bag.

Muted make-up and a soft pink pout elevated her look instantly. We think her styling is simple yet effective and she did look good.

However, we can’t say the same about Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Earlier this year, we spotted the same jacket on The Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star on her return to India from the Cannes 2017 Film Festival.

She was seen pairing it with simple blue jeans, a black tank top. Pink Ferragamo ballerinas, and a floral Fendi sling bag and it was a major disappointment. First, we don’t like the shade of the jeans and second, ankle boots instead of ballerinas would have looked better. However, her blow-dry hair, and her make-up with her signature black liner-defined eyes and nude pink lipstick looked good on her.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

IndyCar driver Sebastien Bourdais has been cleared to resume racing, nearly three months after crashing during Indianapolis 500 qualifying.

IndyCar medical director Dr. Geoffrey Billows said Wednesday that the 38-year-old Frenchman was evaluated by IndyCar orthopedic consultant Dr. Kevin Scheid on Tuesday and given clearance to fully return to racing activities.

Bourdais fractured his pelvis, a hip and two ribs when his car exploded into pieces and spun through Turn 2 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway after hitting the wall at nearly 230 mph.

Dale Coyne Racing didn’t immediately announce when Bourdais would race next, though the driver has targeted the season finale at Sonoma on Sept. 17.

Bourdais won the season-opening race in St. Petersburg in March for his 36th IndyCar victory. He won four straight Champ Car season titles from 2004-2007.

Three labourers died in an accident during construction work at IIT-Kharagpur in West Midnapore on Wednesday.

As per police sources, the deceased have been identified as Chitta Ghosh, Amitabh Mahapatra and Prabhakar Mishra — all hired by a sub-contractor through outsourcing.

“The labourers were working at the construction site of the Diamond Jubilee Complex of IIT when the accident took place,” said a police officer.

The labourers were working on the fifth floor of an eight-storey building, which is spread across a 27,000 sq m area, sources said. They were allegedly in a lift, which somehow lost its grip and plummeted to the ground. The resulting noise attracted nearby workers, who rushed to the spot and found the labourers lying on the floor.

The three were immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where they were declared brought dead. “We are probing to find out if there was any negligence on the part of the contractor company. The investigation is underway,” said an officer.

"I’m hoping West Indies can at least win one Test or compete against England, says Curtly Ambrose","Curtly Ambrose expected some fight from West Indies against England. (Source: File) Curtly Ambrose expected some fight from West Indies against England. (Source: File)

Former West Indies seamer and legend of the game Curtley Ambrose believes West Indies will have to be on top of their game if they are to compete with England when the three Test series begins on Thursday with a day-night Test in Edgbaston. However, he played down West Indies’ chances owing to the exodus of important players that could have possibly made a difference.

“I am concerned with the way we are playing,” said 53-year-old Ambrose to BBC for whom he would be part of the commentary panel. “I am hoping they can at least win one Test or compete, but, as a realist, I am not too sure they will,” he added. West Indies are on a six consecutive Test series losing streak with their last win coming back in 2014 against Bangladesh.

Ambrose represented West Indies in 98 Tests and picked up 405 wickets while forming a lethal seam bowling partnership with Courtney Walsh. But the on-going issue surrounding West Indies Cricket Board and the players will see absences of veterans Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Darren Sammy and Marlon Samuels from the side that takes the field on Thursday. “I still believe if we had all those names, our cricket would be better. Look at the Twenty20 squad. We have them players available and they have always been a force. According to the Cricket West Indies board, you have to be available to play all the first-class games in the region to be eligible for the Test team. I don’t have a problem with that, but Cricket West Indies need to be more lenient with their players if they want their best team. So many players are starting their careers so have no-one to turn to who is a senior pro,” added Ambrose while claiming the inexperience plagues the eighth ranked West Indies.

"Young designer brings child abuse, women trafficking issues on LFW ramp","Sumiran Kabir Sharma’s line, inspired by the red light area of Sonagachi, happened with an accidental car ride. Sumiran Kabir Sharma’s line, inspired by the red light area of Sonagachi, happened with an accidental car ride.

Sumiran Kabir Sharma, one of the Gen Next designers at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter/Festive 2017, displayed a line-up that was more than just “beautiful dresses” here on Wednesday. Sharma, the creative director of the brand Anaam, says his line was inspired by the red light area of Sonagachi and he wanted to focus attention on social issues like child abuse and women’s trafficking through his clothes.

“That was a part of my inspiration and research… a lot of children and women are abused and trafficked, so we tried to bring that into… fashion… as a cause,” Sharma told IANS. He says that he will always cover social causes in his work.

“It’s an ethical collection and social causes are always a part of brand Anaam. Fashion is meaningful and it’s not just about wearing a beautiful dress and going out. If we can save… children from sexual abuse, then there is nothing like that,” he said.

Talking about how this idea came into being, he said it all happened with an accidental car ride. “My inspiration was Sonagachi. An accidental cab ride took me to this area and I was amazed to see women who were more like warriors. So I took that inspiration and brought in my clothes through soothing fabrics and textures,” he said.

Sharma has been doing his bit of social work with CRY and other small women-oriented NGOs. “We try and talk to children and explain what is a good touch and bad touch, and I feel for it,” he said.

Day one of LFW started with the Gen Next show, where apart from brand Anaam, four other brands showcased their designs. The other new faces were Akshat Bansal, Deepak Pathak, Shenali Sema N’ Rinzin Lama and Saaksha Parekh and Kinnari Kamat.

They displayed varied designs, some of which were in asymmetrical patterns focussing on knots, while others displayed black as their theme in different patterns.

The Gen Next segment of LFW has previously given the industry names like Rahul Mishra, Masaba Gupta, Aneeth Arora and Nachiket Barve. Barve was seen appreciating the works of these new faces, along with veteran designer Manish Malhotra.

Nitish Kumar orders CBI probe into Bhagalpur Srijan NGO scam,"Taking a dig at Nitish Kumar’s zero tolerance policy against corruption, Yadav had asked for a CBI probe into the Rs 1,000 crore Srijan scam. (File photo) Taking a dig at Nitish Kumar’s zero tolerance policy against corruption, Yadav had asked for a CBI probe into the Rs 1,000 crore Srijan scam. (File photo)

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday recommended a CBI inquiry into alleged Bhagalpur Srijan NGO scam hours after Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Tejashwi Yadav demanded the same. Taking a dig at Kumar’s zero tolerance policy against corruption, Yadav had asked for a CBI probe into the Rs 1,000 crore Srijan scam, in which government funds were transferred to private accounts between 2005 and 2013 when BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi was the Finance Minister.

“It is high time that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommend a CBI probe into Srijan scam as he has repeatedly been claiming zero tolerance against corruption,” Yadav, who is in Bhagalpur in connection with his ongoing Janadesh Apman Yatra, had said.

Tejashwi’s father and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad also reiterated his demands for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the matter. Tejashwi Yadav had also said he has not been allowed to hold a meeting in Bhagalpur since Wednesday as the “government is afraid” that he will expose Srijan scam and the leaders behind it. He said Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi was the Finance minister when “crores were looted from people. None but Modi is responsible for it”.

Lalu Prasad, who is appearing before a CBI court in Ranchi in connection with fodder scam, said: “Nitish Kumar should sack Modi immediately if he has zero tolerance against corruption, and arrest him. There are solid evidences of Modi’s involvement in the scam.”

Lalu Prasad also accused Nitish Kumar of ‘murdering democracy’ by not allowing his son Tejashwi Yadav to hold a rally in Bhagalpur. Lalu said, “Nitish Kumar is wounded, he has choked democracy.”

Dark Eden,"Title: Swarga Author: Ambikasuthan mangad

Publication: Juggernaut

256 pages

Swarga is an ambitious attempt to fictionalise an ecocide that has been unravelling in Kasaragode district in Kerala for many years. Thousands of people, particularly children, have been afflicted by a host of debilitating diseases, that are blamed on the aerial spraying of Endosulphan, a pesticide, in cashew plantations ringing the Kasaragode ghats. The public debates triggered by the tragedy has raised fundamental questions about modern agricultural practices and the responsibility of public institutions towards citizens. Endosulphan spraying was banned in 2000 and reports from the region point to the regeneration of local flora and fauna that had disappeared when pesticide use was rampant in large government-plantations.

Swarga, first published to much acclaim in Malayalam as Enmakaje in 2009, tells the story of the villagers of Swarga, Enmakaje and many other such hamlets who fought the PCK, which meant the state itself. The novelist, Ambikasuthan Mangad, however, has sought to turn what could have been a dry, grim catalogue of data and protests into an epic about modern man’s search for meaning in a technology-mediated world of consumption.

His narrators are a couple who, disgusted with urban life, have taken refuge in the forests of the Jadadhari hill in the shadow of which lies Swarga. Mangad calls them the Man and the Woman, since the two had decided to strip themselves of their past, identities and memories, when they left the city to retire to the jungle. Their attempt to reject an anthropomorphic worldview and journey back to a life in nature almost becomes a parable of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, retracing the steps back to the Garden of Eden. When the woman — her name, we are told later, is Devayani — returns home with an orphan, the Man revolts. However, the baby, who turns out to be a stunted child, exposes them to the world beyond their Eden.

It is a world of a people, whose ancestors had sinned against nature and built a society of exploitation. The couple joins the struggle launched by a visiting activist, a local doctor and a journalist to bring justice to the people. The novel ends with a manipulative politician attacked by a golden serpent, who had worked against the interests of the people, and the couple, Devayani and Neelakantan, finding their awakening in a cave in the Jadadhari hill.

The patches, where Mangad tries to sketch a life for the couple in the city, jars the narrative. Blame it on the activist self of Mangad, parts of the novel assume a didactic tone which disturbs the philosphical armature he seeks for the subject. These anomalies, however, do not detract from the novel’s importance as flagging a seminal issue of our time: How best do we build our lives without violating the basic tenets of life itself.

Tiger Woods had five drugs in system at time of arrest: Reports,"Tiger Woods was arrested, and then released, at the end of May for impaired driving. (Source: AP) Tiger Woods was arrested, and then released, at the end of May for impaired driving. (Source: AP)

Former World No 1 Tiger Woods had five different drugs in his system when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in May, as per a report by ESPN that was published on Monday. The reported cited a copy of the toxicology report which said Woods had Hydrocodone, the generic form of a painkiller branded as Vicodin; Hydromorphone, a painkiller known as Dilaudid; Alprazolam, a mood and sleep drug known as Xanax; Zolpidem, a sleep drug known as Ambien; and Delta-9 carboxy THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in his system when he was arrested by the police.

It is unclear at this stage if Woods had prescriptions for these medications. It must be made clear here that marijuana for medicinal purposes is legal in Florida.

Woods had checked into a clinic in June for treatment to help deal with prescription drugs. He’s faced a drop in performances with his off the course activity dominating the headlines more than his on the course play with the former World No 1 still playing catch up to Jack Nicklaus who has 18 majors to Woods’ 14. He had said last month that he had completed the treatment.

“As I previously said, I received professional help to manage my medications,” Woods said in a statement. “Recently, I had been trying on my own to treat my back pain and a sleep disorder, including insomnia, but I realise now it was a mistake to do this without medical assistance. I am continuing to work with my doctors, and they feel I’ve made significant progress. I remain grateful for the amazing support that I continue to receive and for the family and friends that are assisting me.”

Local police had found Woods stopped on the side of a Palm Beach-area road in his Mercedes at about 3 AM (7 AM GMT) on May 29. As per the police report from the incident, Woods had “extremely slow and slurred speech” when being awakened by a police officer. But he was co-operative and told officers that he takes several several prescriptions, including Xanax.

The golfer who was headed away from his registered address could not recall where he was going and told police that he was returning from Los Angeles. A blood test conducted later showed he had a painkiller Vicodin and the antidepressant Xanax in his system but there was no alcohol content. He was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and improperly stopping his vehicle. Following the arrest, Woods released a statement where he apologised to the fans and blamed the incident on prescription medication that he was taking to manage pain for his back surgery that had also stalled his career.

Let Morne Morkel retire on his terms: Allan Donald,"Several reports have emerged linking Morne Morkel with the Kolpak. (Source: AP) Several reports have emerged linking Morne Morkel with the Kolpak. (Source: AP)

Former South Africa fast bowler, Allan Donald has asked current pace bowler Morne Morkel not to turn his attention and join the Kolpak deal. This was after several reports emerged linking Morkel and teammate Hashim Amla with the Kolpak as speculations about their future were rife.

In an interview with the Titans’ official website, Donald said, “Don’t reconsider your future. South Africa needs you. Your performances against England in the Test series were the best I have seen you bowl in a very, very long time.” and added, “Give him what he wants. Let him retire on his terms. We need him this summer. I have not seen him bowl this well for many, many seasons. There’s no doubt, Morkel is world-class. It is just a shame that he did not take bucket loads of wickets in England because he deserved it. He beat the bat on countless occasions without reward.”

It may be recalled here that earlier Morne Morkel had fuelled speculations about his future when he admitted that he was nearing the end of his career.

“After this tour, we’ll see. I’ll sit and speak with Cricket South Africa and see where they see me featuring. But I love playing for this team. It’s not rocket science that they probably want to start looking, in white-ball cricket, at the 2019 World Cup. Am I going to part of those plans? If I can be around to help the younger guys find their feet, so be it. I’ll do that. For me the main focus is this tour and then we’ll go back and see how we go.”, Morkel had said.

Noticeably, several South African players like Stiaan van Zyl, Hardus Viljoen, Daryn Smit, Rilee Rossouw, Kyle Abbott, David Wiese, Simon Harmer and Dane Vilas have already secured Kolpak deals with English counties in recent times.

"Verdict on Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in rape cases soon, Punjab, Haryana on alert","Gurmeet Ram Rahim. (File) Gurmeet Ram Rahim. (File)

The police forces of Punjab and Haryana have been put on a high alert ahead of the special CBI court’s verdict in a case involving alleged rape of two sadhvis (women followers) of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, whose chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is the accused in this case.

The case, registered in 2002, had been going on in the special CBI court at Panchkula for the last few years. It is in the final stage of hearing and on Wednesday, it was adjourned for Thursday for final arguments.

In June, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had vacated the stay on passing of the judgment in the case. Also, in a judgment last month, Justice Surinder Gupta of the Punjab and Haryana HC had asked the trial court to conclude the trial “at the earliest” after observing that the accused was filing one petition after another against the orders passed by the trial court to prolong the trial pending for nine years.

Haryana’s DGP B S Sandhu told The Indian Express that paramilitary force had been sought from the Union government ahead of the verdict, which is expected soon. “We have sought additional forces from the Centre in view of the verdict expected in the case,” he said.

The Union home ministry on Wednesday held discussions with the top officials from Punjab and Haryana and directed the state authorities to be on alert.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim is accused of raping two women followers inside the dera premises. He is also the prime accused in a case involving the murder of his follower Ranjit Singh and a journalist, Ram Chander Chhatarpati, and is facing trial in the same special CBI court.

An Ambala court of the special CBI judge in 2008 had framed charges against the dera chief for alleged sexual exploitation of the sadhvis. The dera management had been vehemently refuting all these charges.

Chinese state newspaper says Donald Trump trade probe will “poison” relations,"Trump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea. (Source: AP Photo) Trump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea. (Source: AP Photo)

U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to his top trade adviser to investigate supposedly unfair Chinese trade practices will “poison” relations between the two countries, a Chinese state-run newspaper said on Monday. Trump will later on Monday issue the order to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.

The move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea’s nuclear missile programme as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.

Trump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.

In an editorial, the official China Daily said it was critical the Trump administration doesn’t make a rash decision it will regret.

“Given Trump’s transactional approach to foreign affairs, it is impossible to look at the matter without taking into account his increasing disappointment at what he deems as China’s failure to bring into line the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” the English-language paper said.

“But instead of advancing the United States’ interests, politicising trade will only acerbate the country’s economic woes, and poison the overall China-U.S. relationship.”

An administration official has insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were “totally unrelated”, saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.

The China Daily said it was unfair for Trump to put the burden on China for dissuading Pyongyang from its actions.

“By trying to incriminate Beijing as an accomplice in the DPRK’s nuclear adventure and blame it for a failure that is essentially a failure of all stakeholders, Trump risks making the serious mistake of splitting up the international coalition that is the means to resolve the issue peacefully,” it said.

“Hopefully Trump will find another path. Things will become even more difficult if Beijing and Washington are pitted against each other.”

Four business leaders have resigned this week from U.S. President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council to protest the president’s tepid comments to weekend violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka became the latest to resign on Tuesday after Trump blamed both sides for the violence that left one woman dead and several others injured. Merck & Co Inc’s Kenneth Frazier, who is African-American, was the first CEO to leave one of Trump’s presidential advisory councils and was followed by the chief executives of Intel Corp and Under Armour Inc.

Trump on Monday denounced white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, as “criminals and thugs,” bowing to days of mounting political pressure to condemn such groups explicitly. However, on Tuesday he reverted to his earlier comments blaming “many sides” for the violence. The following are responses from companies and CEOs on Trump’s manufacturing council to the violence in Virginia:

* Dow Chemical Co: “I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia,” Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement.

Dell Inc: “There’s no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees,” a Dell Inc spokeswoman said in a statement. CEO Michael Dell plans to remain on the manufacturing council.

* General Electric Co: Jeff Immelt will remain on the council while he is the chairman of the company. “GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,” a company spokesperson said.

* Intel Corp: “There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries leadership to do the same,” CEO Brian Krzanich said in a tweet. He later said in a blog post on Intel website that he was exiting the council “to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues.”

* Under Armour Inc: “We are saddened by #Charlottesville. There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity,” CEO Kevin Plank, who also left the council, said in a tweet from the company’s Twitter account.

* Whirlpool Corp: Whirlpool will stay on the council. “Whirlpool Corp believes strongly in an open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds. Our company has long fostered an environment of acceptance and tolerance in the workplace,” a company spokeswoman said.

* Campbell Soup Co: Chief Executive Denise Morrison will remain on the council. “The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our society. Not simply because of the violence, but because the racist ideology at the center of the protests is wrong and must be condemned in no uncertain terms,” a company spokesman said in a statement.

* American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO): AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka will resign from President Trump’s Council on Manufacturing, effective immediately. “I cannot sit on a council for a president that tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Trumka said.

* Wal-Mart Stores Inc: “Representing a company with the largest and one of the most diverse groups of associates in the U.S., and an even more diverse customer base of tens of millions of customers, we believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together,” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said.

* Johnson & Johnson: “In the end, I have concluded that Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to remain engaged, not as a way to support any specific political agenda, but as a way to represent the values of Our Credo as crucial public policy is discussed and developed,” Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.

* International Paper Co: “International Paper strongly condemns the violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend – there is no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in our society,” a company spokesman said in a statement.

* Boeing Co: Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will stay on the manufacturing council.

* U.S. Steel Corp: A spokesperson referred queries related to the American Manufacturing Council back to the White House.

"Five pools, 3 cranes needed for immersion: Puja panels","According to a Durga puja management committee in CR Park, though, the proposal isn’t new. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) According to a Durga puja management committee in CR Park, though, the proposal isn’t new. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

IN the meeting between different Durga Puja management committees and the Delhi government, the committees said they need five pools and at least three hydra cranes to ensure proper immersion, while also noting the need for specific rules to ensure “there is no chaos”.

Earlier, the government had proposed that the Durga puja management committees immerse all idols in one location and allow the DJB to aid them and “greatly reduce pollution”.

This, officials explained, would help the Delhi government in ensuring that pollution is minimised while also controlling chaos pertaining to traffic on the day of immersion.

Bhardwaj added, “The ponds aren’t very deep, so the cranes might not be necessary. But we have spoken to the department and water minister Rajender Pal Gautam, and we don’t think it would be a problem. The department is chalking out a final plan.”

According to a Durga puja management committee in CR Park, though, the proposal isn’t new. “We have been trying to get this done for two years. No one disagrees with the plan, as such. But we need five pools and three hydra cranes. The government should ensure that only registered pujas can avail this. There should be no more than 25 pujas booked for one location. There should also be people pull out the idol 0 minutes after immersion. We have shared these with the government and are hoping for a positive outcome.”

"India vs Sri Lanka: This is the worst series loss I have experienced, says Dinesh Chandimal","Dinesh Chandimal saw his side lose the Test series 3-0 to India. (Source: AP) Dinesh Chandimal saw his side lose the Test series 3-0 to India. (Source: AP)

After suffering a 3-0 whitewash at the hands of team India, a dejected Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal claimed that it was the worst Test series in his career.

Speaking to the reporters after the match, Chandimal said, “This was the toughest series in eight years playing international cricket, no doubt,” and added, “The reason is that we were not able to take the games to five days. The previous two were four-day Tests, and this was a three-day Test. Since I’ve been in this team, this is the worst series loss I’ve experienced.”

Commenting on the lack of application shown by the Lankan batsman, he said, “We were not able to take the games to five days. I am disappointed that if we could have dragged the game to the fifth day we could have learned something, but losing within two and half days you cannot give any excuses,” and added, “As an opener you should at least bat for 15 to 20 overs. As I said, we gave some game plan to each and every player. They have to execute them when in the middle. We failed to do that in the series and that cost us dearly I would say,”

He further went on to add, “As a captain, I would like to take the responsibility. The fans have always supported us. They encourage us always. Today we saw despite losing, people applauding us. That is what the team needs now. We cannot let the players be mentally down. We are doing the process right. We might not get results soon, but we are confident that the future looks good,” he added with hope.

“During training, we are doing a lot of hard work. We had some gameplan and we spoke so many things during the game. As a player when you have to go to the middle you have to put them to practice. That was what the batsmen were unable to do. As players we had to stand up and do our performances well,”

Lauding team India for their consistent performance, Chandimal said that he doesn’t want to give any excuses but did admit that consistency has been a huge issue this series.

Food Review: Twist of Taste,"Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant.

With a modern dining room that exposes its busy brigade of chefs through a glass panel on the ground floor, and a cosier, more sequestered space tailored for groups of four or more on the floor above, where jazz plays unobtrusively and mood lighting nudges the gaze towards the table, W. D. House makes one thing very clear: your focus is meant to be on the food.

W. D. House travelled south from Chandigarh, where it is both recognised and glorified, to Delhi last month. Much like its neighbour in GK II’s M block, China Garden, the fine dining restaurant opens itself to patrons from noon to 3.30 pm and then from 7 pm to midnight. This edition of W.D. or Whistling Duck, aims to encourage conversations about the “indigenous modernity” of the ’40s and ‘50s — asserted with a single stem rose perched on tables dressed in lily-white covers and cane chairs, but also with its food. An ambitious menu — that can, perhaps, leave one confused — offers regional Indian, Southeast Asian, and European cuisines.

But, confusion is not a welcome guest here, and is soon defenestrated as head chef Richa Johari takes one through the menu. It is, then, easy to realise that the food here is as straightforward as her. You get what you ask for, but with a twist. Take, for instance, the Rhododendron squash, an enchanting, deep-pink drink made of the sweetly-scented flowers from Uttarakhand with celery and black salt. Or the Pashtun-style Chappali Kebabs, a compound of goat meat, coriander seeds, vetiver roots and pomegranate seeds, that followed soon after. The little frills are only a reflection of Johari’s deft hand with spices, and a result of her attention to detail evident in her zen-like precision to presentation.

Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Even with the Almond Crab Cake — flakes of almond-coated fat crab patties to be paired with a gandhraj (strong scented citrus from Kolkata) aioli — the flavours were neither big nor subtle. An attempt at choreographing a duet of textures came through in all the dishes.

If you want to better your relationship with karela, or bitter gourd, W.D. House should be your choice of counsellor. Rings of bitter gourd coated in batter and deep fried were tossed in a raw mango murabba dressing with raw onion, heirloom tomatoes and cucumber slices. This dish has the potential to convert the most ardent karela dismissers.

Another orthodox yet atypical offering from the restaurant’s kitchen was the Guay Tiew Moo, a dish popular in Thailand. Traditionally made with the meat that must not be named, this one was with pork that sat in the deep end of a bowl, amid lettuce, sprouts, and flat noodles, brimming with galangal flavoured broth with seemingly harmless red chillies that gave the soup a bit of a jolt. For the mains, a dish from Jharkhand, Dhuska — deep-fried discs made with rice, lentils and chillies — was paired with a chicken saag curry.

The dhuska mellowed the sharpness of the mustard oil that the chicken was cooked in, resulting in a harmony of flavours. The other main, a ravioli of blue cheese in a smooth, brighter-than-the-sun yellow, pumpkin puree came drizzled with basil flavoured olive oil and pine nuts. The umami from the parmesan, pungency of the blue cheese and sweetness of the pumpkin worked beautifully together, but the pasta was not al dente enough.

For dessert, we dug into the basil and lime cheesecake topped with a grape and balsamic reduction. The pairing of the basil with the reduction lent a sophisticated touch to the albeit slightly dry cheesecake, making for an intriguing conclusion to the eclectic meal.

Nehru Planetarium Director to record total solar eclipse in United States,"The main attraction of the TSE is the solar corona, which is the external atmosphere of the sun. (Representational Image) The main attraction of the TSE is the solar corona, which is the external atmosphere of the sun. (Representational Image)

Arvind Paranjpye, the director, Nehru Planetarium, Mumbai, will observe the Total Solar Eclipse (TSE) on August 21, from Irwin, Idaho. He will be attempting to record three phenomena associated with the TSE — first of which is to record the shadow bands. “Just before the totality begins, what is left of the Sun is a thin crescent. When the light from this crescent sun passes through the atmosphere of the Earth, it manifests itself as rapidly changing bright and dark bands. These are called shadow bands. Paranjpye will try to video record these bands,” stated an official release issued on Wednesday.

The main attraction of the TSE is the solar corona, which is the external atmosphere of the sun. This corona also has a polarised component. Paranjpye will attempt to take the images of the solar corona in three angles of polarisation — 0, 60 and 120 degrees. This will give the extent of a polarised corona. Between the shadow bands and the totality, for a fraction of a second, one can see thin atmosphere of the Sun, called chromoshpere. Helium was discovered in this atmosphere, during the TSE of August 18, 1886, which was seen in India. The phenomenon is called flash spectrum. Paranjpye will also be attempting to videograph the flash spectrum.

It may be noted that Helium is the only element that was first discovered outside the Earth. Would these observations yield any scientific data? “Not really…” said Paranjpye. The study of the sun and solar eclipses has reached such a stage that even fair scientific results are possible only with good scientific aim and instrumentation. However, observations of the kind that Paranjpye is attempting shows how these are possible using small or moderate instruments. “And who knows, serendipitous discoveries are always a possibility,” he added.

HC notice to Punjab govt on truck union ban,"Over 90,000 trucks had gone on a protest last month and stayed off the roads for a day against the government decision to disband over 134 truck unions in the state. Over 90,000 trucks had gone on a protest last month and stayed off the roads for a day against the government decision to disband over 134 truck unions in the state.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday issued a notice to the Punjab government over a petition challenging the state government’s decision to ban truck unions in the state. All Punjab Truck Operators Union had last week moved the High Court seeking quashing of the government notification on the proposed ban.

During hearing of the case before the single bench of Justice Rajan Gupta, Punjab Advocate General Atul Nanda termed the petition premature saying the government by the notification dated July 24 has only issued draft rules for which the government has invited suggestions and objections during a period of 30 days.

The union in a civil writ petition before the High Court has said that the government’s decision to disband truck unions has adversely affected the work of truck drivers and the business of transportation. “In case the decision by the government is not withdrawn, it will lead to unemployment of about 6,12,000 persons who are directly involved in this business as drivers, cleaners, mechanics and owners of the trucks,” the plea said.

Over 90,000 trucks had gone on a protest last month and stayed off the roads for a day against the government decision to disband over 134 truck unions in the state. According to an estimate, over 93,000 trucks in state are affiliated to various unions.

In July, the Punjab government had approved the Punjab Goods Carriages (Regulation and Prevention of Cartelisation Rules), 2017, that prohibit the truck operators from forming cartels or unions in the state. The notification issued by the Transport department said the government “is desirous of regulating the operations of goods carriages of all types with the object of bringing an end to the cartelisation and consequent exploitation of consignors and consignees of goods by such formal or informal unions” including the truck unions.

“80 per cent of the trucks out of total of 93,000 trucks attached to the unions are of those persons who have no other source of income and are fully dependent upon the trucks attached with the union,” the truck operators union argued while seeking directions to restrain the government from meddling in the business of truck unions and quashing of the notification.

"‘West Bengal government not serious in tackling flood’, says Dilip Ghosh","Floods come every year. But no survey was ever done, embankments were not repaired,” said Ghosh during a press conference at the party headquarters in Kolkata. (File Photo) Floods come every year. But no survey was ever done, embankments were not repaired,” said Ghosh during a press conference at the party headquarters in Kolkata. (File Photo)

The BJP on Wednesday targeted the Mamata Banerjee government over the “grim” flood situation in the state, alleging that it had failed to take any preventive measures. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said that the government was not serious in dealing with the flood situation and had instead resorted to blame the Centre over it.

“The flood situation is grim in Bengal. North Bengal is cut off from the rest of India and the chief minister is blaming the centre. However, it is clear that no preventive action was taken. Floods come every year. But no survey was ever done, embankments were not repaired,” said Ghosh during a press conference at the party headquarters in Kolkata.

The state BJP chief also blamed the state for not co-operating with the Centre in tacking the flood situation in Bengal. “One of the (state) ministers was heard saying that the Centre is not looking at Bengal but Bihar and Assam on the flood issue. But why is the state not co-operating with the Centre. Why didn’t the state government informed the Centre over the flood situation here? The state government has no information about the flood situation. Some one is saying that the floods have incurred Rs 55 crore losses while someone else is saying that the losses are to the tune of Rs 400 crore,” he said.

Ghosh alleged that even after the floods ministers were not seen visiting affected areas. “Only Mamata Banerjee went to one spot near Kolkata and took some pictures. The government is not serious in tackling the floods,” he said.

Ghosh also said that the chief minister should immediately convene an all-party meeting over the flood situation. “The chief minister should also sit with all agencies and NGOs and have a clear cut plan of action on the floods and relief measures,” he added.

Regarding Darjeeling, Ghosh said that the party wants a solution and blamed Mamata for inciting violence in the Hills. “There is politics going on regarding Darjeeling. Mamata Banerjee incited violence there. Police fired and lathicharged on the protesters. Over 90 tea gardens are shut and tourism is badly hit. I have spoken to the Hill parties and Union home minister Rajnath Singh a number of times. I have told him (Singh) to do whatever possible for the people of the Hills,” said Ghosh.

The state BJP president also stood by the central government over not airing the speech of Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar. “If someone thinks that he will say whatever he thinks and the state-run media will telecast it, he is wrong. Central government has the right to censor objectionable content,” said Ghosh.

CAT 2017: This is how you need to start preparing for exam to get admission in IIMs,"CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination

CAT 2017, which is going to be held on November 26, is now just three months away. CAT consists of three sections which are Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). Each of these sections is allotted one hour and there are 100 questions altogether.

Important topics in each section

Quantitative Ability (QA): In QA, the majority of the questions come from algebra, number system and permutation and combination. Make sure that these topics are covered thoroughly by solving as many questions as possible from them. Getting comfortable with these topics would help you in boosting your confidence. Questions from geometry mostly have a short-cut method to solve them. Try to learn different short-cut methods to solve them while giving sectional tests.

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC): In VARC, the majority of questions come from para-jumbles and Reading Comprehension (RC). Try to solve RC of different domains like psychology, science, economics, medicine. Getting comfortable while reading those passages from unfamiliar domains would help you in brushing up your understanding skills and help you prepare better.

Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR): LR & DI is all about practising and increasing your speed of solving. Try to sharpen up your mind by solving as many diverse questions as possible.

Keep these tips in mind while preparing for CAT 2017

Study regularly: In case you started your preparation recently, you need not worry. Instead, just focus on your preparation, without getting stressed out. Make sure that you study on a regular basis. It is important to study a minimum of 3-4 hours per day. In case you are doing a job along with your preparation, try to cut down on your sleep at night and study during that period.

Balance speed and accuracy: CAT is about balancing accuracy and speed at the same time which can be achieved only through maximum practice. In the initial phase of your preparation, try to focus more on accuracy rather than speed. Gradually, with time, try to increase your speed keeping your accuracy constant. Do not just focus on one section and prepare for that. It is important to solve questions of every section on a daily basis. It helps in keeping the speed and comfort with all the topics intact.

Cover all topics: Leaving out certain topics for CAT might not be a good strategy. You may lose out on an opportunity to score easy marks. In case you want to leave any topic during preparation, make sure that the topic should is not a very important one, for example, para-jumbles or permutation & combination.

Understand your strong and weak areas by giving sectional mocks: Since every section has its own cut-off, therefore it is important to know your strong and weak areas. In case you have just started your preparation, for the next couple of weeks, work on your concepts and understand them thoroughly. Also, give sectional mocks of these topics to understand how well acquainted you are with those topics. Just giving sectional mocks won’t help you a lot. It is even more important to see the solutions and analyse your performance and learn from your mistakes.

Attempt full-length mocks: The same thing goes for full-length mocks as well, where just giving too many mocks isn’t the best way to prepare. A substantial amount of time should be given to the analysis of those mocks. Also, the learning from those mocks should be absorbed and they should be carried forward into the next mock. You can practice sectional and full-length mocks on the gradeup app.

Look for the simplest method: At times, there are multiple ways to solve the same question. Try to solve the question by the shortest method using tricks and short-cuts. Make sure that you keep those tricks in mind for future use. Just solving a question by using a long method doesn’t do any good.

Take small breaks in between: It is sometimes necessary to take breaks in-between study while practising. This helps you to freshen up your mind and improve your efficiency.

Make a weekly study plan: Make a thirteen-week study plan in which the first six weeks should focus more on concept building and giving sectional mocks. The next seven weeks should focus more on giving full-length mocks and analysing them in detail. This would include working on your weak areas and making sure that you develop a certain level of comfort with those topics.

Sincere and dedicated efforts along with a smart study plan during these 3 months will surely help you get a seat in your dream B-school.

Business leaders quit Donald Trump panel; he hits back hard,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

President Donald Trump ripped into business leaders who resigned from his White House jobs panel, the latest sign that corporate America’s romance with Trump is faltering after his equivocal response to violence by white supremacists in, Virginia. “They’re not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country,” the president said yesterday at an impromptu news conference at Trump Tower in New York City.

After his remarks, a fifth member of his manufacturing panel resigned: AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who said in a statement, “We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism.” The president denied that his original statement about the violence in Virginia on Saturday saying “many” sides were to blame, rather than hate groups â€” was the cause of the departures.

“Some of the folks that will leave, they’re leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside” the United States, he said as he seemed to double down on his earlier comments. Trump also assailed the CEOs who left on Twitter as “grandstanders” and said he had plenty of executives available to take their place. The president added that he believes economic growth in the US will heal its racial divide.

But the parade of departing leaders from the informal panel seems closely linked to how the president responded to events that led to the death of a counter-protester that opposed the white supremacists. Among those who’ve left are the chief executives for Merck, Under Armour and Intel and the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.

Alliance president Scott Paul, in a tweet, said simply, “I’m resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it’s the right thing for me to do.” Within minutes of the tweet yesterday, calls to Paul’s phone were being sent to voicemail. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon joined the chorus, saying in a note Monday to employees, “(We) too felt that he missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists.”

But McMillon, whose business has customers on all sides of the political spectrum, plans to stay on a separate Trump advisory panel and said that the president’s follow-up remarks on Monday that named white supremacists were a step in the right direction. Corporate leaders have been willing to work with Trump on taxes, trade and reducing regulations, but they’ve increasingly found themselves grappling with cultural and social tensions amid his lightning rod-style of leadership.

The CEOs who left the council quickly faced his wrath, while those who have stayed have said it’s important to speak with the president on economic issues. Like several other corporate leaders, Alex Gorsky, chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, said that intolerance and racism have no place in US society but that he intended to stay on the manufacturing council.

“We must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it,” he said in a statement. A White House official downplayed the importance of the manufacturing council and a separate policy and strategy forum featuring corporate leaders. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the panels were informal rather than a set body of advisers.

The departures, the official said, were unlikely to hurt the administration’s plans to overhaul taxes and regulations. Many corporate leaders have faced a lose-lose scenario in which any choice involving politics can alienate customers, not to mention a US president who has shown a willingness to personally negotiate government contracts.

Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, one of only four African-Americans leading a Fortune 500 company, was the first to tender his resignation Monday. He was assailed almost immediately by Trump on Twitter. Then came resignations from Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and then Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. On Under Armour’s Facebook page Yesterday, customers who supported Trump threatened to boycott the athletic clothier.

Austan Goolsbee, the former chief economist for President Barack Obama, said the departures suggest the president’s response to the violence in Charlottesville could alienate those who work for the companies, and those who buy the products and services that they sell. “It’s certainly a sign that Trump’s more controversial stuff isn’t playing well with companies selling to middle America,” said Goolsbee, now a professor at the University of Chicago.

There had already been departures from two major councils created by the Trump administration that were tied to its policies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

The manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier, Musk, Plank, Paul and Krzanich, resign. So far, the majority of CEOs and business leaders that are sitting on the two major, federal panels, are condemning racism, but say they want to keep their seats at the table.

“Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering, and we will remain active champions for these efforts,” said a spokesman for Campbell Soup for CEO Denise Morrison. “We believe it continues to be important for Campbell to have a voice and provide input on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees in support of growth.” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg also will remain. So will Michael Dell, the head of his namesake computer company. Both companies contract with the government.

Lawrence Summers, once the chief economist at the World Bank and senior Treasury official, wondered when more business leaders will distance themselves from Trump. “After this weekend, I am not sure what it would take to get these CEOs to resign,” he tweeted. “Demonising ethnic groups? That has happened.”

Trump embarrassing US by making pro-Nazi comments: Sanders,"Senator Bernie Sanders. (Source: AP Photo) Senator Bernie Sanders. (Source: AP Photo)

Senator Bernie Sanders, while commenting on the Donald Trump’s latest remarks on Charlottesville clashes, has said that the United States President is embarrassing the country and the millions of Americans who fought and gave up their lives to defeat Nazism. Sanders in a tweet said, “@realDonaldTrump, you are embarrassing our country and the millions of Americans who fought and died to defeat Nazism.”

“The violence in Charlottesville was caused by Neo-Nazis and white supremacists attempting to spread their hateful and racist ideology,” he added.

President Trump in a press conference, defended some of the white supremacy rally’s participants, made the case for Confederate statues and equated neo-Nazis to leftist activist groups.

“This week, it is Robert E. Lee and this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” Trump said.

The US President emphasised that both sides of the clashes contributed to the violence which happened in a white supremacists rally in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.

Earlier, Trump had condemned the violence in Charlottesville, saying that “the hatred and division in the America must stop as we are all Americans first.”

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” he had said during a short statement, adding that he had been closely following terrible events unfolding in Virginia.

Mentioning that the current unfolding of events in Virginia is not linked to his presidency, Trump said, “It has been going on for a long time in our country — not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.”

“Hate and division in the country must stop. No matter our colour, creed, religion, our political party, we are all Americans first,” he said, adding that he’d like for his administration to “study” why such violence is occurring. He didn’t take questions from reporters.

“What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent,” noted Trump. “There are so many great things happening in our country, so when I watch Charlottesville, to me it is very, very sad.”

Trump said that he spoke to Governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe and they agreed that the hate and the division in the America must stop and must stop right now.

“We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and true affection– really, I say this so strongly, true affection for each other.”

He further said, “Our country is doing very well in so many ways. We have record — just absolute record employment. We have unemployment the lowest it’s been in almost 17 years. We have companies pouring into our country, Foxconn and car companies and so many others. They’re coming back to our country. We’re renegotiating trade deals to make them great for our country and great for the American worker.”

Demonstrators clashed on the streets of Charlottesville ahead of a white nationalist rally, with counter-protesters and right-wing nationalist groups converging on the college town in the latest chapter in the United States’ debate over race and identity.

The protests were initiated by the city’s government decision of removing the confederate past, including a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

"China targets Alibaba’s Taobao, other e-commerce sites, in VPN crackdown","Chinese authorities have issued a warning to the country’s top e-commerce platforms, including Alibaba Holding Group Ltd’s Taobao.com, over the sale of illegal virtual private networks that allow users to skirt state censorship controls. Five websites have been asked to carry out immediate “self-examination and correction” to remove vendors that sell illegal virtual private networks (VPNs), according to a notice posted by the Zhejiang provincial branch of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), China’s top cyber regulator.

Some of them were ordered to halt new user registrations, suspend services and punish accountable staff. “The (CAC) has ordered these five sites to immediately carry out a comprehensive clean-up of harmful information, close corresponding illegal accounts … and submit a rectification report by a deadline,” the regulator said on Thursday.

This is the latest in a series of measures taken by China to secure the internet and maintain strict control over content. Surveillance is being further tightened ahead of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party later this year, when global attention will be on news from the world’s No.2 economy.

Recently, China said it was investigating its top social media sites, including WeChat and Weibo, for failing to comply with cyber laws. It has already taken down popular celebrity gossip social media accounts and extended restrictions on what news can be produced and distributed by online platforms.

This is in addition to its campaign to remove VPN apps. Regulators have clamped down on dozens of local VPNs, and ordered Apple Inc and other app stores to remove foreign VPN apps that allow users to access foreign websites censored by the government.

China has also passed laws, which will come into effect from early 2018, that require telecommunications providers and tech firms to play a greater role in removing VPNs.

On Chinese online marketplaces, including the country’s largest e-commerce site Taobao, vendors sell a range of tools to set up personalised VPNs that are harder to track and block than some other services.

“Taobao forbids the listing or sale of any products that are forbidden by applicable law. We screen and remove product listings from third-party sellers which violate our marketplace rules,” an Alibaba spokeswoman said, referring to the products mentioned in the regulator’s notice.

Other sites named in the notice include women-focused social shopping network Mogujie and entertainment platforms Xiami and Peiyinxiu. The notice did not specify the date of the deadline by which the sites have to complete the rectifications.

"Barcelona van attack: We saw people going flying because of the collision, says eyewitness","Injured people are treated in Barcelona after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said. (Source: AP) Injured people are treated in Barcelona after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said. (Source: AP)

A van ploughed into crowds in the heart of Barcelona on Thursday killing at least 13 people in what police said they were treating as a terrorist attack.

Police said they said were searching for the driver of the van who, according to local media, fled the scene on foot. Spanish newspaper El Periodico said two armed men were holed up in a bar in Barcelona’s city centre, and reported gunfire in the area, though it did not cite the source of the information.

It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were connected. A source familiar with the initial US government assessment said the incident appeared to be terrorism, and a White House spokeswoman said President Donald Trump was being kept abreast of the situation.

Media reports said the van had zigzagged at speed down the famous Las Ramblas avenue, a magnet for tourists.

“I heard screams and a bit of a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that,” eyewitness Tom Gueller told the BBC.

“It wasn’t slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.”

Mobile phone footage posted on Twitter showed several bodies strewn along the Ramblas, some motionless. Paramedics and bystanders bent over them, treating them and trying to comfort those still conscious.

Around them, the boulevard was deserted, covered in rubbish and abandoned objects including hats, flip-flops, bags and a pram.

“We saw a white van collide with people. We saw people going flying because of the collision, we also saw three cyclists go flying,” Ellen Vercamm, on holiday in Barcelona, told El Pais newspaper.

TOURIST DRAW

Emergency services said people should not go to the area around Barcelona’s Placa Catalunya, one of the city’s main squares at the top of the Ramblas, and requested the closure of nearby train and metro stations.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured.

The incident took place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe’s top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.

Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe since July 2016, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm.

Witness Ethan Spibey told Britain’s Sky News: “All of sudden it was real chaos. People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.”

He said he had taken refuge with dozens of other people in a nearby church.

“They’ve locked the doors because I’m not sure whether the person who may have done it has actually been caught, so they’ve locked the doors and told people just to wait in here.”

Authorities in Vic, a small town outside Barcelona, said a van had been found there in connection with the attack. Spanish media had earlier reported that a second van had been hired as a getaway vehicle.

Barcelona is the capital of the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia, which plans to hold a popular vote on Oct. 1 on whether it should secede from Spain. It is in dispute with the central government, which says the vote cannot go ahead because it is unconstitutional.

This is the deadliest attack in Spain since March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

More than 40 installations are to light up London in one of the biggest ever light shows, Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Thursday.

Streets, buildings and public spaces will be illuminated during the Lumiere London festival which is expected to attract millions of visitors to the British capital next January.

The event takes place between January 18 and 21 in what Khan says will be a chance for people across the world to see London in a new light.

More than 40 British and international artists will transform London and offer new perspectives on the capital’s iconic architecture, streets and landmarks.

Building on the phenomenal success of Lumiere London 2016, festival destinations will include King’s Cross, London’s West End, including Carnaby, Regent Street, Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, Mayfair, Piccadilly, St James’s, Fitzrovia and Westminster.

Works will be exhibited on both sides of the River Thames, with Covent Garden, Victoria, South Bank and Waterloo added as new destinations for 2018.

Mayor Khan said: “Lumiere London 2018 will be bigger, brighter and bolder than ever before, with even more areas of the city involved and even more people expected to visit this incredible festival.

“Lumiere London 2018 shows that London is open to people from across the world and open to creativity and ideas, and open for business. There’s no better way to banish the January blues — so get ready to take to the streets and marvel at a dazzling array of incredible artwork and installations.”

Lumiere London in 2016 attracted more than 1.3 million visitors to London at a time when the city is usually quiet following the Christmas break.

"Arsenal risk losing Alexis Sanchez for free, says Arsene Wenger","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. (Source: Reuters) Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. (Source: Reuters)

Arsenal risk losing striker Alexis Sanchez for free next season, according to manager Arsene Wenger, who confirmed the club have made no progress on a new contract for the Chilean striker.

Sanchez, 28, is currently in the final year of his contract. He has been linked with a move to Paris St Germain in the current transfer window.

“We have not progressed on that front,” Wenger said in a news conference before Arsenal head to Stoke City on Saturday.

“At the moment, he is a player who goes into the final year of his contract and prepares for the season. We have not made any progress on the other front.

“It’s not an ideal situation on the financial side and it demands some sacrifice … but it doesn’t mean the players who are in the final year of their contract will not extend their contract. We will work on that as well.”

Wenger said Sanchez is still recovering from an abdominal strain but is expected to regain full fitness before the club’s match in Liverpool on Aug. 27.

“For Sanchez, it (Stoke) looks a little early, but he works hard in training,” Wenger added. “He should be available for next game against Liverpool.

“His recovery is going very well, he is working very hard. But you have to be very cautious. It was a muscle strain and (you have to be wary) not to have any setback on it.”

The manager confirmed midfielders Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who are also in the final year of their contracts, are firmly in his plans for the current season.

Wilshere returned to action from a fractured leg during Arsenal Under-23’s 3-2 win over Derby County earlier this week.

“It’s good that he is back and available,” Wenger said. “I think he needs games now. He might play again on Monday night. He is not far away now.”

Arsenal began their campaign with a 4-3 home victory over Leicester City last weekend.

Australia accuses New Zealand opposition of dirty tricks over citizenship fuss,"Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce (Reuters/file) Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce (Reuters/file)

The Australian government accused a New Zealand opposition party on Wednesday of conniving to bring it down by revealing that Australia’s deputy prime minister is a New Zealand citizen, and thus ineligible to sit in parliament.

The outcry over the deputy prime minister of a government with a one-seat majority has led to rare acrimony between the long-term allies, whose relations are usually defined by chummy banter and fierce sporting rivalry.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Monday he may not be eligible to sit in parliament after being told he was a dual citizen by descent. The New Zealand government later said Joyce held New Zealand citizenship as his father was born there. His mother was Australian and his father came to Australia in 1947 as a British subject. Australian politicians are not eligible to be elected to parliament if they hold dual or plural citizenship.

The revelation about Joyce’s roots came to light after New Zealand’s opposition Labour Party member Chris Hipkins raised the matter in parliament there. Australia’s government saw Hipkins’ question as part of a dark plot between the opposition in New Zealand and Australia to “steal government”.

“It is extraordinary that a New Zealand member of parliament has allowed himself to be used by a party in a different country with an intent to bring another party in that country down. It is quite extraordinary,” Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Parliament on Wednesday.

“This is highly unethical, at least. But, more importantly, puts at risk the relationship between the Australian government and the New Zealand government,” Bishop said. She said would find it hard to trust members of a political party that had been used to undermine the Australian government.

‘POOR JUDGEMENT’

The leader of the New Zealand Labour Party, Jacinda Ardern, rejected Bishop’s accusations as “false claims”. Australia and New Zealand see themselves as the closest of allies with common heritage, bonds of kinship and shared interests. Their troops have fought alongside each other in far-flung wars for generations, most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The kerfuffle could play into a New Zealand general election on Sept. 23, with the Labour Party enjoying a surge in support. New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English said he accepted the Australian reaction, and he took the opportunity to give the Labour Party a ticking-off for getting mixed up in Australian politics.

“The Labour Party in New Zealand has to explain that because it’s very poor judgment that they got involved with it,” English told reporters in Wellington.

Australia’s High Court will begin hearings into Joyce’s eligibility on Aug. 24. Should he be ruled ineligible, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would be forced to rely on independents to get pass legislation. Turnbull said he expected the court to rule in Joyce’s favour but independents are smelling blood. “I’ve been treated like a door mat, I am a door mat but in a couple of weeks, I may not be,” independent MP Bob Katter told Reuters.

At least 7 dead in suspected gang attack at Guatemala hospital,"Blood stains a passageway at the Roosevelt Hospital, in Guatemala City, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Source: AP Photo) Blood stains a passageway at the Roosevelt Hospital, in Guatemala City, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Source: AP Photo)

At least seven people were killed and 12 others injured on Wednesday after suspected gang members attacked a hospital in the capital in a bid to free a jailed associate who went there under police supervision for a checkup, officials said. “Anderson Daniel Cabrera, a gang member from the Mara Salvatrucha, was coming for a medical review,” police spokesman Jorge Aguilar said, adding the suspected gang members “are suspected of wanting to rescue him.”

Police arrested five of seven suspected gang members who were armed with assault rifles when they attacked Guatemala City’s Roosevelt Hospital, although Cabrera escaped, Aguilar told reporters.

Cabrera had been jailed since late 2013.

“The search for those responsible will continue and they will see the law enforced. These are terrorist acts,” Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told reporters.

Among the seven people killed were three security guards and a hospital janitor, said Edwin Bravo, director of the San Juan de Dios hospital where the injured were transferred.

Patients on crutches and in stretchers and wheelchairs were evacuated from the hospital as police officers searched for other attackers. Hallway floors were stained with blood and walls were pocked with bullet holes, according to a Reuters witness on the scene. Like El Salvador and Honduras, Guatemala struggles with endemic gang violence, especially from the powerful Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13, and its rival Calle 18, who sow terror across Central America.

"Confusion over GST persists: Wholesale grain market affected, sales fall by 40 percent in Pune","Only a little over half of the registrants on GSTN have so far completed the process by filling up part B of the registration form. (Representational image) Only a little over half of the registrants on GSTN have so far completed the process by filling up part B of the registration form. (Representational image)

Over a month after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into effect, the grains section of Gultekdi wholesale market has reported 40 per cent lower sales. This dip in sales, said traders, is due to the confusion about whether GST is applicable to branded and registered branded commodities, which has kept retail traders away from the wholesale market.

As per GST rules, the tax will not be applicable to packaged goods without a registered brand, but most retailers are wary of taking the risk. Brands which are officially registered will attract a 5 per cent GST.

Loose food grains have been exempted from the GST ambit, but the problem at wholesale markets is the ambiguity regarding the definition of a ‘brand’. Wholesalers usually pack loose grains in packets with generic names and sell them to the retailers. Majority of grains are sold in such packets, which has led to some confusion about whether GST is applicable to them.

On an average, about 225 vehicles carrying goods come to the Gultekdi market for trade, but of late only about 150 such vehicles visit the market. Popatal Ostwal, president of the Poona Merchant’s Chamber, said several retailers were avoiding the market as they feared they would have to pay GST on the product. Most of the retail traders will have to make two declarations in a year under the GST composite scheme.

Ostwal said the Chamber has written to both the Centre and the state finance ministry, asking for clarity on the issue, but was yet to receive a response. Ajit Sethiya, former president of the Poona Merchant’s Chamber and president of the Jaggery Merchants Association, said many retailers had stocked up on commodities, ahead of GST, and they were avoiding visiting the market. Given the lack of clarity, retailers have stopped purchasing from wholesalers and in some cases, wholesalers have stopped selling under brand names. While the government has allowed a two-month moratorium to file returns, retailers are wary about the tax burden.

Another fallout of the GST regime was an increase in the wholesale prices of most food grains, said Ostwal. “The per quintal price has increased by around Rs 300. Our experience is directly opposite to the claims made by the government… that food grains prices would go down post GST,” he said

"SC asks NIA to probe Kerala woman’s conversion, marriage","Shefin Jahan and his wife Shefin Jahan and his wife

THE SUPREME Court on Wednesday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over the probe into a Hindu woman’s conversion to Islam and her subsequent marriage to a Gulf returnee in Kerala after the agency said that it did not appear to be an isolated case.

According to the NIA, “two outfits whose names had cropped up in the case may have links with the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).”

A bench of Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud asked retired Supreme Court judge R V Raveendran to monitor the investigation.

The Kerala government did not oppose the demand for NIA probe and left it to the court to take an appropriate decision.

The bench drew parallels with the controversial online game ‘Blue Whale Challenge’ to convey its apprehensions in the matter. “We hear there is a game called Blue Whale Challenge. There are things that can lead people to do anything,” CJI Khehar said while rejecting opposition to involving NIA in the case.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Kerala native Shefin Jahan, whose marriage to the woman was annulled by Kerala High Court in May this year. A Homeopathy graduate, the woman, originally named Akhila, had converted to Islam and subsequently had an “arranged marriage” with Jahan.

“It does not appear to be an isolated case,” Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, who appeared for NIA, told the court. He contended that the case had similarities with conversion and marriage of another Kerala woman, which is still under investigation.

The woman in that case had told the police that she was “advised to marry a Muslim to avoid any interference by court”.

Singh told the court, “The lady who takes custody (of these women) gets them married. Some of the entities also appeared to be common — the girls leave their home because of differences with parents and somebody volunteers to give them shelter. This requires investigation.”

CJI Khehar pointed out that the HC order “also mentions so (that it was not an isolated case)”.

Raising doubts on the woman’s mental state, the court wondered “why she, a Homeopathy graduate, had given three names on three different occasions”.

Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Jahan, opposed the demand for NIA probe and said that the state police’s Crime Branch investigation was still incomplete.

In reply, the CJI said, “This is an incident pertaining to Kerala. There are some very serious remarks made by the High Court. Today you say Crime Branch probe is not over. Why not?”

Sibal, assisted by senior counsel Indira Jaising, insisted that the court should meet the woman and interview her. But the court replied that the HC had already interviewed her. When Sibal pointed out that the HC interview was a long time ago, Justice Chandrachud said a lot of events had taken place since then.

The court took exception to contentions that it was prejudging the case. It said, “We want all sides to have equal opportunity…we want to take any decision only after all inputs come. We are not prejudging. You are being unfair.”

The court said that it will meet the woman at a later stage before arriving at any final decision.

Rs 1 lakh fee, Rs 2 lakh for travel expense

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said its former judge Justice R V Raveendran, under whose guidance the NIA would probe a controversial case of annulment of a marriage in Kerala, would be paid by the Centre a consolidated fee of Rs 1 lakh, besides Rs 2 lakh per day for travelling outside Bengaluru.

The bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud said the Centre would reimburse the expenses to Justice (Retd) Raveendran within two weeks from the date of submission of bills by him. “The Government of India shall reimburse the same… within two weeks from the date of submission of the bills,” it said.

Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Guendogan has set his sights on making a return to first-team action in the Premier League encounter against Liverpool on Sept. 9 as he nears full fitness following an extended injury layoff.

The Germany international, who injured his knee in December, played 20 minutes of City’s 1-0 friendly loss to Girona in Spain on Tuesday but said there remained a long way to go to get fully match fit.

“I was out for eight months so there is no reason to rush now. When I feel good, ready and safe, I’m ready to play and try. That’s also the target for the next weeks,” he told City’s website. (www.mancity.com)

“There’s an international break in the next two weeks so plenty of time still to use that for training and maybe more games if that’s possible.

“Hopefully after that break I will be ready to join the team fully. I want to be there when my manager and my team mates need me.” City, who beat promoted Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0 in their league opener last Saturday, host Everton on Monday.

Chess legend Garry Kasparov suffers first loss in his comeback event,"At the day’s close Garry Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India. (Source: File) At the day’s close Garry Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India. (Source: File)

Chess legend Garry Kasparov suffered the first loss of his brief but highly anticipated comeback to the game, succumbing to fellow Russian Ian

Nepomniachtchi and bringing his draw total to five.

After three draws on Monday, the 54-year-old former world champion — who dominated the game from 1985 to 2000 — had hoped to play “more aggressive” chess on day two of the Rapid and Blitz tournament in St Louis.

But after drawing his first game yesterday with Armenian world number four Levon Aronian, a contest that featured some gutsy moves from Kasparov and a few trademark death stares, he could not hold on against Nepomniachtchi.

At the day’s close Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India, another “former” competitor and the only one present to have played against Kasparov when he ran the global chessboard.

“I haven’t played serious chess in 12 years, & haven’t missed as many opportunities as I did today in 15! Hoping to steady the ship tomorrow!” tweeted Kasparov at the end of the day.

“I was too democratic today. I made quite a few good moves, but spread them evenly among all three games instead of concentrating them!” After his loss Kasparov’s fans, all hoping to see the brilliance that characterized his long career, said they were disappointed but still hopeful.

“It had to happen. But he is doing pretty well for a comeback against these new players,” said one fan, 42-year-old American Tracy Stewart. “He hasn’t been offensive enough.”

Kasparov, who left the game in order to pursue a career in politics, will need some wins if he wants to move up in the tournament rankings — he started Tuesday in 7th position out of 10.

Victories would give his comeback some symbolic power — Kasparov would be seen as passing the torch to a new generation, albeit a generation still spellbound by his talent.

But those more youthful players seem determined to knock Kasparov from his pedestal. On Tuesday neither his risks nor his intimidating

glowering looks paid off.

American grandmaster Robert Hess had predicted a “tough day,” saying that “every opponent is extremely strong, so Garry will certainly need to bring his A game if he is going to try to score some victories.”

Though the winner’s purse in St Louis is a not-too-shabby $150,000, Kasparov said he would donate any winnings to promote chess in Africa.

Clerical abuse scandal hits Argentine president’s school,"In this July 4, 2017 photo, Rufino Varela, who attended the Cardenal Newman school, poses for a portrait in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Finnlugh Mac Conastair, a Passionist, and by at least one Christian Brother priest. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)

Rufino Varela was a distraught, confused 12-year-old when he went looking for help from the school chaplain to tell him he’d been sexually abused by a mason at his family’s home. Instead of aiding, Varela says, the Rev. Finnlugh Mac Conastair took off the boy’s pants, flogged him and fondled him in a room below the chapel at one of Argentina’s most prestigious schools. Then, the Irish priest known by many as “Father Alfredo,” offered him candy and told him that they should keep it as a secret with God.

“I had come looking for help, but I felt that it was a punishment from God,” Varela said. “I came back to the classroom, holding back tears, went home and never spoke about it.” The secret was kept for nearly four decades. But in recent months, Varela’s decision to break his silence has led several other former students to denounce clerical abuse at a school that has educated President Mauricio Macri and many other members of Argentina’s elite.

The case is one of several that have shown the church has not been spared sexual scandals even in the home territory of Pope Francis, who has pledged a zero-tolerance policy against abuses that have rocked the church around the world. While the pope had no connection with the abuse at the time _ he led the Argentine branch of the Jesuit order with no relationship to the school _ Varela said he received a call from the pontiff this year after revealing the abuse publicly.

The Cardenal Newman school was launched in Argentina in 1948 by the Christian Brothers, a religious order founded two centuries ago to focus on educating disadvantaged youth. In recent years, it has faced abuse claims at many of the schools it has opened worldwide. At the time of Varela’s 1977 encounter with Mac Conastair, the socially conservative church school had evolved into something of a refuge for children of the rich.

Varela said he decided to confront Newman authorities about the abuse after he heard that the school planned to add a crown to the lion in its coat of arms in honor of Macri, a 1976 graduate who was elected president in 2015.

“Instead of a crown, it would give me more comfort to see a whip or a crown of thorns,” Varela said in a letter to the rector. “This would be in remembrance of the aberrations that many others suffered.”

Varela said Newman’s rector, Alberto Olivero, then met with him, offered psychological treatment and tried to dissuade him from going public with the story. The school refused to comment and referred questioners to written statements. Frustrated at the lack of public acknowledgement, Varela said, he spoke to Argentina’s La Nacion newspaper in December 2016. He also began writing about it on Facebook.

In February, his phone rang and Pope Francis was on the line. The pontiff expressed his solidarity and apologized on behalf of the church. “He told me that I needed to understand that I was a very important part of a broken link,” Varela said.

The Vatican doesn’t confirm or deny such calls, saying they are part of Francis’ pastoral activities.

Varela said about 20 other former students have contacted him to describe similar abuse carried out by Mac Conastair, a Passionist, and by at least one Christian Brother priest at the school. At least four of the ex-students repeated accounts of witnessing or suffering abuse to The Associated Press, though it is not clear if the others had reported the incidents earlier. Both of the priests have died.

Pedro Ellis told the AP he was about 14 years old when Mac Conastair called him into his room. With the excuse of giving him a sex talk, he asked him to get naked and lie down on his bed. “He touched my buttocks and then, he introduced one or two fingers inside my rectum,” Ellis told the Associated Press.

Ellis, now 52, said that he’s considering seeking compensation for the abuse. Julio Castano said the chaplain he’d seen as “God’s representative on earth” called him into his room in 1979 and fondled the then 12-year-old.

“I decided it was now time to tell it, so we can get this off our backs,” said Castano, who until then, had not told anyone else publicly or informed the school. Another former student alleged that the Brother John Derham sat him on his lap in the school library and kissed him on the mouth. A fourth ex-student, Guillermo Newbery, 68, told the AP that he witnessed Derham make students sit on his lap during his class, saying he would “caress students excessively, rubbed them and hugged them inappropriately.”

Newbery said he told his parents in 1963 and they reported it to the school’s Parent Association. Derham died in 1986. After Varela spoke to the press, Olivero sent a letter addressed to the Newman community and acknowledged the abuse of at least one student 40 years ago.

A copy of the letter was posted on the school gate. Without naming anyone, it said that the Christian Brothers apologized “for the abuse that all former students could have suffered as a result of the inadequate and unjustified behavior” of the chaplain.

The head of the Christian Brothers for Latin America, Hugo Caceres, sent Varela a letter expressing “solidarity and Christian compassion” for all abuse victims.

At the time of Varela’s abuse, the rector was John Burke, an Irishman who was in charge of Newman from 1979-1996. Burke was later named member of a Christian Brothers committee for safeguarding children in Europe. Burke confirms he learned of the abuse in 1980, but said he didn’t know the identity of the victim until Varela went public.

“Towards the end of the school year of 1980, I was made aware of a complaint of inappropriate behavior by the college chaplain towards a pupil whose identity was not known or revealed to me,” Burke said in a statement to the AP.

It wasn’t clear how Burke had learned of the case, though Varela said that he once told lay brother Desmond Finnegan, who counseled him to remain quiet about the incident and pray for the elderly chaplain.

In an odd twist, Burke said he sought advice about the case from a lawyer who turned out to be Varela’s father, a judge in charge of child protection cases.

“I can understand your shock at hearing that I had spoken with your father concerning the priest,” Burke wrote in a June 2016 letter to Varela. Varela said his father died without ever learning of the abuse of his son.

Burke told Varela that, “I took immediate and what I judged to be appropriate measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all the pupils in the school and of every person who had contact with the chaplain.” The measures included “immediate removal of the chaplain by his religious superior and the Bishop of the Diocese.”

Records obtained by the AP show that Mac Conastair was transferred to the San Cayetano vicary, but it’s unknown whether he had contact with other children before he died in 1997. Clerical abuse experts say Burke’s action was significant because in the 1970’s there were no church rules for reporting such crimes.

“It sounds like at least John Burke took some action and the bishop forced the priest out of the school,” said Maeve Lewis, executive director of victims group One in Four. “That happened here (in Ireland) all the time and no one brought it to the attention of their bishop.”

But Varela remained frustrated at the failure of Burke, the school and the Brothers to acknowledge the “abhorrent sexual and psychological abuses” in public.

“I am not the only victim of Newman School. We both know it,” Varela wrote in a letter to Burke in October 2016. He also criticized for former rector for failing to mention the abuse when he spoke at an annual alumni dinner attended by Macri that month.

A video published online by Newman’s alumni association five years ago, shows Burke referring to Derham as his novice master and praising him as “the most extraordinary person.”

In March 2017, the church held a Mass to apologize to Varela and any other victims. “The church has asked for pardon and I renew that request here, in my diocese, to all those people who have been victims of abuse, whether as children or youths, by members of our hierarchy,” San Isidro Bishop Oscar Ojeda said in his homily.

He said church leaders have a duty to bring such cases before both civilian and canonical courts _ a reference to procedures adopted in response to an avalanche of complaints that church leaders had long been too slow in responding to abuse cases.

In Argentina, two priests and three other men were arrested last year and charged with sexually abusing more about 20 students at the Antonio Provolo Institute, a school for the hearing impaired. One of the priests had been accused of abusing students at Provolo’s Verona, Italy, school, and was even identified to Francis as an abuser in a letter in 2014, but no action was taken against him by the Vatican.

The Champagnat school founded by the Marist Brothers in downtown Buenos Aires recently reported that a lay brother allegedly abused a former student 38 years ago. The elite school, whose alumni include former Argentina President Fernando de la Rua, said the brother had carried out directorial duties at the school over the last decade. It said an investigation had been launched and that the person, who was not named, had been sent to a nursing home for “old and sick brothers.” Varela said he expects more from the church. “You ask yourself: Why are these people still free?” Varela said.

"Yogi Adityanath: If I cannot stop namaz on road, I have no right to stop Janmashtami at thana","Yogi Adityanath said officers briefing him on the kanwar yatra told him that use of use of microphones, DJs and music systems would not be allowed. (Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) Yogi Adityanath said officers briefing him on the kanwar yatra told him that use of use of microphones, DJs and music systems would not be allowed. (Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Wednesday said that if he cannot stop the offering of namaz on roads during Eid, he has no right to stop celebration of Janmashtami at police stations. “Agar mai sadak par Eid ke din namaz padhne pe rok nahi laga sakta to mujhe koi adhikar nahi ki mai thano mein janmashtami ke parv ko rokun… koi adhikar nahi,” he said.

He said when officers red-flagged the use of microphones, DJs and music systems during the recent kanwar yatra (the annual pilgrimage of Shiv devotees), he told them to ensure that microphones are banned everywhere and no sound emanates from any place of worship. He said he asked the administration whether such a ban could be enforced and if it was not possible, then the yatra would continue the usual way.

(“Maine prashasan se kaha… sabhi pradeshon ke jo adhikari aaye thay… maine kaha ki mere saamne ek aadesh paarit kariye phir ki mike har jagah ke liye partibandhit honi chahiye… har jagah ban karo… aur yeh tay kariye ki kisi bhi dharmsthal mein… uski premises ke bahar, uski awaaz aani hi nahi chahiye… kya isko laagu kar payenge?…Agar laagu nahin kar sakte hain to phir isko bhi hum laagu nahi hone denge… yatra chalegi.”)

Speaking at an event organised by the Prerna Jansanchar Evam Shidh Sansthan, Noida and Lucknow Jansanchar Evam Patrakarita Sansthan — RSS Sah-Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale too was present — the Chief Minister said officers briefing him on the kanwar yatra told him that use of use of microphones, DJs and music systems would not be allowed.

“Maine kaha ki ye kanwar yatra hai ya shav yatra?… Arrey woh kanwar yatra mein baaje nahin bajenge, damru nahin bajega, dhol nahin bajega, chimte nahin bajenge, log nachenge-gayenge nahin, mike nahi bajega to woh yatra kanwar yatra kaise hogi,” he said.

(I asked if this was a kanwar yatra or a funeral procession. If they don’t play music and drums, don’t dance and sing, don’t use the mike, how will it be a kanwar yatra) Quoting RSS ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya, Yogi Adityanath said no one should have any objection on the celebration of Ganesh Utsav in every village and town.

He said everyone has the freedom to celebrate festivals in the country. “Hum sabke liye kahenge… Aap Christmas bhi manaiye… kaun rok raha hai… Bharat ke andar kabhi nahi roka gaya… Aap namaz bhi padhiye, araam se padhiye… kanoon ke daayre me reh kar ke padhiye, koi rokega nahin… lekin kanoon ka ulanghan koi karega toh us par kahin na kahin phir takrao paida hoga… aur isi liye in muddon ko prakharta ke saath unhone (Deendayal Upadhyaya) rakha,” he said.

Those who work for strengthening the cultural unity of the country, he said, are called communal. “Jaise, agar mai kahun ki ‘garv se kaho main Hindu hoon’ toh kahenge ki dekhiye, sampradayik ho gaya.” (For example, if I say take pride in saying I am a Hindu, I will be called communal).

He said in Nepal, Mauritius or any country where Hindus of Indian origin live, they feel proud to be called Hindus. “But if we say the same in India, we will be called communal,” he said.

Targeting the previous SP government, Yogi Adityanath said those who called themselves Yaduvanshis had banned the celebration of Janmashtami at police stations and police lines. He said he was of the belief that “prayers and kirtan may bring improvement in the police system”.

"Suicide bombers kill 27, wound 83 in northeast Nigeria","FILE PHOTO: People walk at the site after a bombing attack of an internally displaced persons camp in Rann, Nigeria January 17, 2017. (Source: MSF/Handout via Reuters) FILE PHOTO: People walk at the site after a bombing attack of an internally displaced persons camp in Rann, Nigeria January 17, 2017. (Source: MSF/Handout via Reuters)

A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and killed 27 others at a market in northeast Nigeria on Tuesday, two local officials said, in an attack bearing the hallmark of Boko Haram militants. Two more suicide bombers detonated their devices at the gates to a nearby refugee camp, wounding many people, an emergency services official said.

In all, 83 people were wounded in the three explosions near the city of Maiduguri, epicentre of the long-running conflict between government forces and Boko Haram. Nigeria’s military last year wrested back large swathes of territory from the Islamist insurgents. But they have struck back with renewed zeal since June, killing at least 143 people before Tuesday’s bombings and weakening the army’s control. The group has waged an eight-year war to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, and provoked international outrage by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls known as the Chibok Girls in April 2014.

Its better-known faction, led by Abubakar Shekau, has mainly based itself in the sprawling Sambisa forest, and been characterised by its use of women and children as suicide bombers targeting mosques and markets. A rival faction – based in the Lake Chad region, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi and boasting ties to Islamic State – has in the meantime quietly become a deadly force capable of carrying out highly-organised attacks.

Last month, an oil prospecting team was captured by al-Barnawi’s group. At least 37 people, including members of the team, died when rescuers from the military and vigilantes attempted to free them. The Boko Haram insurgency has killed 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million to flee their homes in the last eight years.

"Can take over private schools that haven’t refunded excess fee, says Delhi govt","CM Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia (Source: PTI) CM Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia (Source: PTI)

The Delhi government said it is ready to takeover the management of 449 schools that have failed to comply with the orders of the Delhi High Court to refund excess fee charged from parents.

The government also filed an affidavit in the Delhi High Court, stating that they have already processed the “proposal to issue showcause notices for taking over the management of schools under Section 20 read within Section 24 (4) (c ) of Delhi School Education Act 2009”.

“Complying with the Anil Dev Singh committee recommendations, we had to take this action. The file has already been sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. We had no option but to take this action as we have been sending notices to them for several years now,” said Atishi Marlena, advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

The government’s response in court was on a petition filed by Abhibhavak Mahasangh, an NGO, which alleged that the Directorate of Education (DOE) failed to comply with the implementation of Anil Dev Singh Committee recommendations.

In its interim and monthly reports of June 2016 to October 2016, the committee had recommended that 544 schools refund excess fee charged from the parents at 9 per cent interest.

Of the 544 schools, 469 were asked to refund the money while 75 schools were inspected and then asked to refund the money. Sixty seven schools challenged the committee’s recommendations, of which 17 cases are being heard in court.

"To boost jobs, Gujarat govt to give Rs 730 crore to MSMEs","Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo) Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo)

The Gujarat government will disburse Rs 730 crore as “capital incentives” to over 16,000 MSMEs, a year after 42,500 units were reported sick in the state. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani will disburse the checks at an event on August 19. “Every year, the government gives an assistance of about Rs 300 crore. We will give a total of Rs 730 crore this year as capital incentives to 16,000 MSMEs to help them expand or set up new units. This will create over 1.6 lakh new jobs,” said M K Das, Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines Department.

This disbursal will be done as per the Industrial Policy-2015, under which the state government had promised to provide financial assistance on term loans provided by banks to the MSMEs. The government is also providing 50 per cent capital subsidy on investments in clean technology, which includes purchasing equipment to meet national and international safety, energy and pollution standards.

The 16,000 MSMEs are expected to make a cumulative investment of Rs 19,000 crore for which they have sought Rs 11,000 crore loans from various banks between April and July, added Das. The aid has come at a time when the number of sick MSMEs has been rising. From 20,452, that were reported sick in 2013, the number has risen to 42,500 in 2016. Gujarat currently has the third highest number of sick MSME units in India, just behind UP (95,989 units) and Maharashtra (52,576).

"After stent, price of knee implants capped: It’s now cheaper by 65%","According to Government calculations released Wednesday, the average price reduction of knee implants after this cap would be in the range of 59 per cent to 69 per cent. (Representational image) According to Government calculations released Wednesday, the average price reduction of knee implants after this cap would be in the range of 59 per cent to 69 per cent. (Representational image)

After capping the prices of coronary stents in February, the Central government Wednesday capped the prices of knee implants in the range of Rs 54,720 to Rs 1,13,950, exclusive of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), in an “immediate intervention” to “check unethical profiteering and exploitative pricing at the cost of the patients in an unregulated market”.

The Indian Express had reported on July 31 that the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) had asked the government to consider including orthopaedic implants, alongside heart valves and intra ocular (eye) lenses, in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) to bring these products under the purview of price caps.

The decision to impose the cap comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his Independence Day speech that prices of knee surgery would be brought down.

According to Government calculations released Wednesday, the average price reduction of knee implants after this cap would be in the range of 59 per cent to 69 per cent. For instance, the average maximum retail price (MRP) of cobalt chromium knee implant, which is widely used in the market, was Rs 1,58,324, according to Government calculations. Its price has now been reduced by 65 per cent now, with the MRP down to Rs 54,720, exclusive of GST.

“Based on the numbers of about 1 to 1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures done in India every year, there will be a saving of about Rs 1,500 crore for the people of India per annum. It is a step to prevent unethical profiteering and ensure affordable and quality healthcare for the last man,” said Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DOP) come under Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers.

“All complaints of overcharging would be strictly monitored and the overcharged amount would be recovered from erring parties with an interest of 18 per cent over it… The government might also consider cancelling of licences and initiate criminal proceedings against stakeholders engaged in unethical profiteering,” said Kumar.

The Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) of 2013 authorises the Central Government to fix the ceiling price or retail price of any drug (or notified medical devices) under “extraordinary circumstances” and “if it considers necessary so to do in public interest”. The NPPA, which enforces the DPCO, stated on Wednesday that the Central Government found that such “extraordinary situation in the case of knee implants does exist”.

“The central government is under constitutional obligation to provide fair, reasonable and affordable price for orthopedic implants and therefore its immediate intervention is imperative to check unethical profiteering and exploitative pricing at the cost of the patients in an unregulated market,” the NPPA stated Wednesday.

The NPPA also made it clear that “no healthcare institutions such as hospitals/nursing-homes/clinics performing orthopedic surgical procedures using knee implants shall solicit any patient to purchase knee implants from it, in case, the patient is interested in procuring such implant from any other third – party sources”.

Terror funds: NIA raids 12 premises in Kashmir,"CRPF personnel outside one of the residences where the raids were conducted, in Srinagar. Shuaib Masoodi CRPF personnel outside one of the residences where the raids were conducted, in Srinagar. Shuaib Masoodi

The National Investigative Agency on Wednesday searched 12 places in Kashmir in connection with the ongoing terror funding investigation. The homes of two lawyers, two drivers and a government official were among those that were searched. One of the advocates, Mohammad Shafi Reshi, who is affiliated to Hurriyat’s S A S Geelani faction, is the uncle of PDP legislator Yasir Reshi.

NIA sleuths and officials said the searches — conducted simultaneously at Sanatnagar, Parimpora, Tarhama and Mazhama in Baramulla, and Machipora and Bakhihaker in Kupwara — have led to documents related to hawala funding.

At Gulberg Colony, the NIA searched the house of advocate Mohammad Shafi Reshi. At Tarhama village, the NIA raided two houses — of Peerzada Ghulam Nabi, who is an employee with the industries, and commerce department, and Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, who is an accountant of businessman Zahoor Watali, who is in NIA custody.

At Mazhama, the NIA searched the home of Abdul Rahim Wani, an advocate and brother-in-law of Watali. The teams also raided the houses of Mohammad Akbar Bhat at Sanatnagar and Ghulam Mohammad Rather in Parimpora. Both are Watali’s drivers.

In Kupwara’s Machipora, the home of one of Watali’s employees, Ghulam Mohammad, was searched. Another search was carried at Bakhihakar village at the house of Abdul Aziz Mir, the caretaker of a property belonging to Watali.

An official said the teams scanned documents and other items for three to eight hours. “In some places, the NIA team spent more than six to seven hours,” he said.

When contacted, legislator Yasir Reshi said he had “nothing to do” with his uncle. “I am an elected representative of people,” he said.

A spokesman for the NIA said the houses belonging to Shafi Reshi and Zahoor Watali had yielded suspect financial records. “Some of the documents seized relate to receipt of money from suspected foreign sources and distribution of money so received to certain persons in Kashmir,” he said.

The separatists and Valley’s business fraternity have termed these raids as political vendetta meant to break resolve of the leadership.

"Trump condemns white supremacists, racism after Virginia rally","US President Donald Trump pauses during a statement on the deadly protests in Charlottesville, at the White House in Washington, US, August 14, 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump denounced white supremacists including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on Monday, and said racism, hatred and bigotry had no place in America following a violent white-nationalist rally in Virginia. Trump had been assailed by Republicans and Democrats alike for failing to respond more forcefully to Saturday’s violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a man crashed his car into a group of counter-protesters.

“Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” Trump said in a statement to reporters at the White House. Critics said Trump had waited too long to address the bloodshed, and slammed him for stating initially that “many sides” were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white supremacists widely seen as sparking the melee.

A 20-year-old man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies as a teenager was facing charges he plowed his car into protesters opposing the white nationalists, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 people. The accused, James Alex Fields, was denied bail at an initial court hearing on Monday. In a strong rebuke to the president, the chief executive of one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Merck & Co Inc, resigned from a business panel led by Trump, citing a need for leadership countering bigotry.

CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump or criticize him directly in a statement posted on the drug company’s Twitter account, but the rebuke was implicit. “America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,” said Frazier.

Victoria Azarenka could miss U.S. Open due to custody battle,"Victoria Azarenka remains optimistic that legal arrangements can be worked out to allow her to compete shortly. (Source: AP) Victoria Azarenka remains optimistic that legal arrangements can be worked out to allow her to compete shortly. (Source: AP)

Two-time grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka said on Thursday she may withdraw from the U.S. Open as she is unwilling to part with her son during legal proceedings to separate from her former partner.

Azarenka returned to action in June, after the birth of her son Leo last December, and reached the last 16 at the Mallorca Open in June and Wimbledon in July during her comeback.

The 28-year-old, who reached the finals at the U.S. Open in 2012 and 2013, remains optimistic that legal arrangements can be worked out to allow her to compete shortly.

“The way things stand now is that the only way I can play in the US Open this year is if I leave Leo behind in California, which I’m not willing to do,” the Belarusian said in a statement.

“Balancing child care and a career is not easy for any parent, but it is a challenge I am willing to face and embrace… No one should ever have to decide between a child and their career, we are strong enough to do both,” she said.

“I look forward to hopefully having positive developments soon so that this difficult situation can be resolved and I can get back to competing.”

The U.S. Open, which is the fourth and final grand slam of the year, will be held from Aug. 28-Sept. 10 in New York City.

"Nowhere in the world has PPP in Metro rail fully succeeded, says E Sreedharan","Metro cannot be a profitable business. The government has to ensure affordable public transport and hence it must invest in it Metro cannot be a profitable business. The government has to ensure affordable public transport and hence it must invest in it

The New Metro Policy looks at reducing the Centre’s role in funding while making PPP mandatory for Metro projects…

It will never work. Nobody will come forward for construction of Metro rail as it has never been a profitable investment. Private players will look at least 12-15% return while no Metro project has ever yielded an investment return of over 2-3%. It’s the most disastrous and retrograde urban transport policy. The JV model, with funding from the Centre and states, has worked very well so far. The Centre is trying to reduce its role in financing and put the entire burden on the state governments. The policy seems to have been framed by someone sitting in the NITI Aayog with absolutely no experience of how Metro rail is built and operated. As it is, in India, all 12 such projects put together, only 20-25 km of new Metro rail is opened every year. China is galloping way ahead at 300 km being opened every year. We are already at a snail’s pace; now with this policy, everything will come to a standstill.

The Ministry of Urban Development has in the past argued that internationally several cities have tried the PPP model for urban rail projects.

Nowhere in the world has the construction and maintenance model of PPP in Metro rail completely succeeded. There have been cases where the government has invested all the money in setting up infrastructure and handed over operations to private parties. But that’s a very foolish thing to do, to put in public investment and allow the private person to enjoy the revenue. How will the government pay back the loan it has taken in the first place? Even if the private player is to spend on just the rolling stock, that constitutes only 18% of the total project cost.

How has past experience with PPP in Metro rail projects been in India?

PPP in India was tried out in Mumbai, Hyderabad, and the Airport line of Delhi. All three are a failure. In the airport line, DMRC invested 55% of the cost (50% of which was borrowed from Japan). Reliance Infrastructure, which was the only private player to come forward, invested in the rolling stock, electrification, and signalling. Reliance started operating the line, they found it loss-making, so they abandoned it, and ran away. We had taken it over and run it ourselves. In Mumbai Metro Line 1, Reliance Infrastructure took almost 7 years to complete 11 km of the relatively easier elevated line and they now claim to be losing 50 lakh per day in revenue everyday despite the very high fares they are charging. In Chennai, the state and central governments invested all the money with borrowing from Japan.

When they called for tenders for handing over the operation and maintenance, only one private firm came forward which quoted twice the DMRC’s O&M rates.

The new policy advocates the commercial development of land along stations to help maximise Metro revenues…

In the Hyderabad PPP model, 300 acres of land for property development was offered as a sweetener and L&T came forward. But since then, property values have come down and real estate is not making the same kind of money as it used to. Even 7 years after they first started the project, Hyderabad hasn’t managed to open even one section since once that is done, L&T will have to start repaying the bank. L&T has already started raising claims on the government with regard to loss of revenue. We had pioneered this public land exploitation model in Delhi but it has not succeeded much. So many shops are still lying vacant.

Why is it necessary that the central government continue to invest in mass public transport?

A good, reliable transportation system is a must to make a city livable and for its economic growth. Would Mumbai have been able to survive without its suburban rail services? The government had invested 100% in it. It is losing money but that doesn’t matter. If the government doesn’t invest, who will? In Kerala’s road transport, the state has entirely funded the construction of roads, their maintenance and lighting. It only handed over the operation of bus services to private players but most bus services are making losses. The Kerala government has to subsidise them at Rs 1 crore per day. Metro is way more capital-intensive as it requires everything from land acquisition to civil works, signalling, and rolling stock. With all that, Metro cannot be a profitable business. The government has to ensure affordable public transport and hence it must invest in it.
