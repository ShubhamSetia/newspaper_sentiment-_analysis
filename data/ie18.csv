President Bashar al-Assad advisor says Syria war nearing its end,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts.

An advisor to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the six-year war is nearly over as foreign states cut backing for rebels, and vowed the government would confront any “illegitimate” forces, whether Turkish or American. Bouthaina Shaaban said the fact that Syria was staging the Damascus International Fair for the first time in the war “sends a message that the war has ended … and we are at the start of the path towards reconstruction.”

With the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Damascus has shored up its rule over much of the country’s populated west. Now, it is marching eastward towards the Deir al-Zor region near the Iraqi border. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, has reached its “penultimate stage” as foreign powers that backed rebels change their policies, Shaaban said in comments to Lebanese al-Mayadeen TV carried on Syrian state news agency SANA on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ended CIA support to rebel groups fighting to topple Assad. Turkey, long one of the main rebel backers, has also shifted its priority away from ousting Assad, seeking to mend ties with Russia and curb Kurdish expansion near its border. “Just as we defeated terrorism, we will fight any illegitimate presence on our land, whether it’s the United States or Turkey,” Shaaban said. “And this is among the challenges we will face at the right time in the right way.”

U.S. forces based in northern Syria are helping Kurdish-led militias push Islamic State militants out of Raqqa city. Washington also has a garrison in the southeast Syrian desert, near a strategic highway border crossing with Iraq, to train local rebels to battle Islamic State. Shaaban said this week’s Damascus trade fair and regional participation proved a “U-turn was achieved” in the conflict, a shift the Syrian army and allied forces were imposing since they seized Aleppo city late last year.

Still, the multi-sided conflict has raged on along several fronts across the country, with Islamic State losing ground to various separate enemies. And while the government has forced several major insurgent enclaves to surrender over the past year, rebels still hold swathes of land, including their stronghold of Idlib province and a pocket of territory near Damascus.

The battle against rebels in western Syria has recently shifted down several gears after a string of ceasefire deals, including one Moscow and Washington brokered for the southwest.

With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts. Syria’s war, which spiralled into violence after mass protests against Assad’s rule in 2011, has made more than 11 million people homeless and sparked a global refugee crisis.

Critics cry foul as young Hong Kong democracy leaders get jail,"Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)

* Joshua Wong jailed for six months for unlawful assembly

* Jail terms disqualifies trio from running for seats for 5 years

* Terms slammed amid accusations of political interference

A Hong Kong appeals court jailed three leaders of the Chinese-ruled city’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

The jail terms will curtail the political ambitions of the trio, disqualifying them from running for seats in the financial hub’s legislature for the next five years.

Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but Hong Kong’s Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

Wong was jailed for six months, Chow for seven months and Law for eight months. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit.

The three appeared stern but calm as their sentences were delivered by a panel of three judges. A lawyer involved in the case said they would appeal. Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led democracy movement, punched his fist in the air as he left the court room and shouted: “Hong Kong people don’t give up.”

Minutes earlier he Tweeted: “They can silence protests, remove us from the legislature and lock us up. But they will not win the hearts and minds of Hongkongers.” Chow waved at his parents as he left the court. His mother broke down in tears.

The three judges in Hong Kong’s second highest court, the court of appeal, wrote in their judgment that the three could not say they were sentenced for exercising freedom of assembly in a city where many democrats see a gradual erosion of freedoms promised in 1997.

“In recent years, there’s been an unhealthy trend in Hong Kong society. Some people use the pursuit of ideals … as an excuse to take illegal action,” Judge Wally Yeung wrote.

“This case is a prime example of the aforementioned unhealthy trend.”

The former British colony, which has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by nearly three months of mostly peaceful street occupations in late 2014, demanding Beijing grant the city full democracy.

The so-called “Umbrella Movement” civil disobedience movement, which drew hundreds of thousands of protesters at its peak, was triggered by Wong and his colleagues storming into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters.

They were later charged with participating in and inciting an unlawful assembly.

Just before sentencing, Wong told over a hundred supporters who thronged into the court lobby, some weeping, that he had no regrets.

“I hope Hong Kong people won’t give up,” he said. “Victory is ours. When we are released next year I hope we can see a Hong Kong that is full of hope. I want to see Hong Kong people not giving up. This is my last wish before I go to jail.”

About 100 supporters later swarmed the prison vans taking the three away from court, shouting slogans, a Reuters witness said. At least one person was taken away by police.

Wong told Reuters on Wednesday that Hong Kong’s democratic movement was facing its “darkest era” and that he’d lost confidence in the city’s independent legal system, long considered one of the best in Asia.

DISSENTING VIEWS

A senior government source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said Hong Kong’s top prosecutors had initially “not recommended pursuing” the case further” after the non-jail terms were handed down.

But Hong Kong’s Secretary of Justice, Rimsky Yuen, overruled them and insisted on re-opening Wong’s case, a decision that ultimately led to their imprisonment, the source said.

In response to emailed questions from Reuters to Yuen seeking clarification, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said it “does not comment on internal discussions regarding individual cases”.

“However, the DoJ (Department of Justice) reiterates that all decisions were made in accordance with the Prosecution Code, the applicable law and relevant evidence.”

The DoJ said in an earlier statement there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive”.

Critics disagreed.

“From the initial choice to prosecute these young democrats through to today’s hearing, these cases have been shot through by politics, not law,” China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement.

“That Hong Kong’s courts increasingly appear to operate as mainland courts do is clear evidence that ‘one country, two systems’ is on the ropes – with ominous consequences for all,”

Amnesty International also slammed the jail terms.

“The relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities,” said Mabel Au, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.

Under the “two systems” formula, Hong Kong enjoys a free judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

In recent months, dozens of protesters, mostly young people, have been jailed for their roles in various protests, including a violent demonstration that the government called a riot in early 2016. (Additional reporting by Tyrone Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Nick Macfie)

Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Guendogan has set his sights on making a return to first-team action in the Premier League encounter against Liverpool on Sept. 9 as he nears full fitness following an extended injury layoff.

The Germany international, who injured his knee in December, played 20 minutes of City’s 1-0 friendly loss to Girona in Spain on Tuesday but said there remained a long way to go to get fully match fit.

“I was out for eight months so there is no reason to rush now. When I feel good, ready and safe, I’m ready to play and try. That’s also the target for the next weeks,” he told City’s website. (www.mancity.com)

“There’s an international break in the next two weeks so plenty of time still to use that for training and maybe more games if that’s possible.

“Hopefully after that break I will be ready to join the team fully. I want to be there when my manager and my team mates need me.” City, who beat promoted Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0 in their league opener last Saturday, host Everton on Monday.

In 1948, Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination sent shock waves across newly independent India. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was banned by Sardar Patel, the then Home Minister and a committed Gandhian, who called it a “cult of violence”.

India’s central banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India, was nationalised in 1949.In 1950, India became a republic upon the enactment of the Constitution and guaranteed universal adult suffrage to all its citizens.

The Planning Commission was set up on March 15, 1950, and the first Five Year Plan, the bedrock of how development was to be planned, pushed and executed in the country, got underway.

From 1951-59, the first Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Kharagpur, Chennai, Powai and Kanpur were set up. This enshrined the idea that technical education was not a luxury, but a necessity for a newly independent, even if poor country, like India.

India started work on what Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first Prime Minister, called the “temples of modern India” — large hydro-electric projects such as the Bhakra Nangal Dam (completed in 1963), Hirakud Dam (completed in 1957) among others.

The first democratically elected Communist government in the world assumed office in Kerala in 1957. It was dismissed by the Centre in two years, but it made history, nonetheless.

K Asif’s magnum-opus Mughal-e-Azam released in August 1960. Asif, apparently, came upon the idea in 1944, after reading a play and had to wait for a long time to get financiers for the film.

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, became the first IIM to be set up on November 13, 1961. Like in the case of the IITs, the idea that the state could subsidise higher education was an audacious one.

The 1962 India-China War over Aksai-chin led to a defeat for India and had serious internal consequences. Nehru’s health took a beating, never to recover, and the non-Left Opposition in the country gained ground. Thousands of Communist members and supporters were arrested.

Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre was set up in 1963.

Another war with Pakistan a year after Nehru’s death in 1964 kept the country on tenterhooks. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the then Prime Minister, mindful of the food crisis as well as the mood of the country, coined the slogan, ‘Jai jawan jai kisan’.

1966 saw the then PM Indira Gandhi devalue the Indian rupee by one-third. The move came under heavy criticism, but it was done in the context of a very shaky balance of payments situation and food insufficiency. Droughts that year resulted in massive food shortage and India had to shop for food in the international world market. The move was criticised heavily, but the devaluation managed to reduce the astronomical fiscal deficit at the time.

Dr Reita Faria became the first Asian woman to win the Miss World pageant in 1966. It would be nearly three decades later that Sushmita Sen would win another beauty pageant in 1994.

The Green Revolution was ushered in in the early Sixties, with the introduction of high-yield variety of crops, eventually leading India to food self-sufficiency.

India won its first Test cricket series in New Zealand in 1968.

Banks were nationalised in 1969 by Indira Gandhi. This was a landmark moment in Indian economics and politics and earned Gandhi her spurs as a pro-poor Leader, which reaped results in the 1971 elections.

Dr V Kurien launched a cooperative milk revolution, the White Revolution, in Gujarat in 1970, enabling women to share the economic prosperity ushered in by their efforts. It was memorialised in the Shyam Benegal film, Manthan (1976). In 1988, the World Bank published an audit which “revealed that of the Rs 200 crore the World Bank invested in Operation Flood (Kurien’s project), the net return on India’s rural economy was a massive Rs 24,000 crore each year over a period of 10 years, to which no other dairy programme has ever matched.”

In 1970, the Department of Electronics (DoE) was set up to “promote the rapid growth of electronics and computers”. Between 1971 and 1978, a company called the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) was set up to lay emphasis on the indigenous design and development of computers, using primarily India-made components. ECIL made the TDC 312 and TDC 316 computers.

Bangladesh was carved out of East Pakistan after a civil war, in which India sided with the Mukti Bahinis of Bangladesh. The Simla Agreement was signed after the conclusion of the India-Pakistan war in 1971, laying the basis of peace with Pakistan for nearly three decades.

Project Tiger was launched in 1973. Its main objective was to ensure a viable population of tigers in India and to preserve areas of biological importance as a “natural heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people”.

The Kesavanand Bharati case was heard before the Supreme Court in 1973. It gave birth to the crucial “basic structure” doctrine of the Constitution. If it did not tamper with India’s “basic structure”, any law could be legislated and could pass muster.

Pokharan nuclear test in 1974 led to the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group internationally to try and restrict India after its show of strength.

Aryabhata, India’s first satellite, was launched in 1975. Built by ISRO, it was launched from Kapustin Yar in the then-USSR. RBI kept the image of Aryabhata on the reverse of the Rs 2 note from 1976 to 1997.

Ramesh Sippy’s Sholay was released in1975, a landmark multi-starrer that became the benchmark for decades to come. Four of the top stars — Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jaya Bhaduri and Hema Malini – went onto become Members of Parliament. The film launched Amjad Khan as the very impressive villain, Gabbar Singh.

The Constitution was amended very significantly in 1976 and the words “secular” and “socialist” added to the Preamble.

The first non-Congress government was formed at the Centre in 1977. Several parties came together as the Janata Party to fight Emergency. Jayaprakash Narayan was the central figure and leader of this anti-Congress formation. Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister after the electoral win.

In 1983, India won the Cricket World Cup under Kapil Dev.

On April 2, 1984, Rakesh Sharma became the first and only Indian to travel in space aboard the Soyuz T-11. When asked by PM Indira Gandhi about what he thought of India from space, he famously replied, “Saare jahan se achha.”

India moved into Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world, in 1984. This is a disputed glacier in Kashmir and while a ceasefire was declared in 2003, it remains a battleground to date.

Operation Blue Star, a campaign by the Indian Army against separatists demanding Khalistan under the leadership of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, attacked the spiritual nerve of the Sikh community — the Golden Temple in Amritsar in June 1984. The extensive damage caused to the shrine, shattered Sikhs, mostly not sympathetic to the Khalistan cause.

In July 1984, India’s first soap opera, Hum Log, scripted by well-known Hindi writer Manohar Shyam Joshi started being telecast on Doordarshan. This was said to have been inspired by a Mexican soap but its portrayals of a middle-class Indian family remain memorable.

Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her security guards in 1984, as revenge for Operation Blue Star. What was shameful for independent India was the organised anti-Sikh pogroms that followed. In 2005, then PM Manmohan Singh would apologise to the nation for the “the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our Constitution”.

In 1986, Harsha Chawda became the first Indian test-tube baby. She made Dr Indira Hinduja, an in-vitro fertilisation expert, a star at the time. Chawda, incidentally, became a mother last year.

In 1987, the Parliament enacted a special law to reverse a Supreme Court order around maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, to restore what was the primacy of Muslim Personal Law over the lives of Muslim citizens. This gave the Hindu right wing a loud campaign message.

After two decades of conflict between the Mizos and the Indian state, in June, 1986, the Mizoram Accord was signed between Rajiv Gandhi and Laldenga. This had a very significant bearing on peace in the north-eastern states.

1989 saw Salman Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses banned in India. It was the first country to do so, but several others followed suit. It eventually led to a fatwa by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini against Rushdie. This was a dark moment and an indication how plural democracies would not commit to freedom of expression.

In the early Nineties, the situation in Kashmir deteriorated with Kashmiri Pandits being forced to leave the Valley as murderous attacks on them made their stay impossible.

The Mandal Commission, arguing for the need for special quotas for Other Backward Classes in government jobs, was submitted to the government in 1980, but was gathering dust till VP Singh decided to implement it in August 1990. The move was to result in a huge tumult, especially in north India. First, anti-Mandal protests and then pro-Mandal protests erupted across the country. Leaders who made a mark in the anti-Mandal and pro-Mandal protests would go on to dominate Indian politics for the next three decades.

In Kerala, the total literacy movement was first initiated in Ernakulam district and Kottayam municipality in the late ’80s. On 4th of February 1990, the then Prime Minister Shri VP Singh declared Ernakulam as the first totally literate district in India.

Economic liberalisation was kicked off formally by then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the first budget after the Congress returned to power in 1991. It was a move that transformed India’s economy, politics and society.

Former PM Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in May 1991, while on campaign in Sriperumbudur. It would go on to change the course of Indian politics.

Panchayat elections became mandatory in 1992, kicking off a silent revolution as elected leadership at local levels provided a basis for deepening democracy in the years to come.

Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was pulled down by a mob, mobilised over months in 1992. It opened up a communal fault line that continues to divide Indian politics.

Satyajit Ray, the legendary Bengali filmmaker, was awarded an Honorary Oscar in 1992 for Lifetime Achievement by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 1995, Aditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge was released both in India and internationally. It would establish Shah Rukh Khan as an enduring star.

The cellphone came to India in 1996. West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu held the first mobile phone conversation in the country.

In 1999, following massive cross-border infiltration, India and Pakistan would face off at Kargil. Pakistan was led by General Pervez Musharraf, who went on to become President of Pakistan.

The hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane flying into Delhi from Kathmandu by the Taliban in 1999 remains one of India’s most dramatic stories of a negotiation gone wrong. Eventually, three terrorists in Indian jails had to be released in exchange for the safe passage of passengers aboard the ill-fated IC 814.

In the late Nineties, Cable TV connected India in a way few things have done. BBC, CNN were all bold and beautiful and put India, slowly but surely, on a path of irreversible information and media integration.

After the attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the biggest military build-up along the border with Pakistan took place, an “eyeball to eyeball” confrontation, as India held Pakistan repsonsible for the assault on the Parliament complex. This was termed Operation Parakram. It finally ended in 2004, with PM Vajpayee’s visit to Pakistan in January and the start of a cross-LoC bus.

In 2002, RSS flew the tricolour for the first time at its headquarters in Nagpur. Till then, it had not recognised the national flag.

Nearly 2,000 people died in the 2002 Gujarat riots, triggered by the burning of a train in Godhra, killing kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya. Retaliatory anger and an administration, either unable to control the situation or complicit in it, watched as Muslims were killed in mob attacks.

India became free of leprosy in December 2005.

India’s space programme came of age as the first unmanned space mission Chandrayaan-1 reached the moon on November 8, 2008. It included a lunar orbiter and an impactor launched by a modified version of the PSLV on October 22, 2008.

The Right to Information Act and NREGA (now, MNREGA) were enacted in 2005 and 2006 respectively. MNREGA and RTI are among the world’s most progressive laws and are recognised by the United Nations as such. Right to Education became a universal right in 2010 and India became one of the 135 countries to adopt it.

India-US Nuclear Accord between Manmohan Singh and George Bush in 2006 broke the nuclear apartheid in place after Pokharan 2 and allowed (at least, in principle) access to crucial civilian and military technology. This came at a price in domestic politics as the Left parties withdrew support to UPA and led to series of unintended consequences politically.

In 2006, Maqbool Fida Husain, among the greatest painters in the world, was forced into exile until his death in London for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiment through his paintings. The Supreme Court though, in the end, defended artistic expression, in a much-discussed verdict.

In 2008, 10 gunmen travelled to Mumbai in a dinghy and killed nearly 200 persons across south Mumbai in one of the worst terror attacks on India.

India won its second cricket World Cup in 2011 under MS Dhoni.

On March 27, 2014, India was declared polio-free.

Narendra Modi was elected Prime Minister in 2014 after the most expensive campaign in Indian political history. He became the first chief minister to directly campaign as a PM-candidate and make it.

Grenade attacks on two bars killed at least three people and wounded 27 others in the Burundian capital of Bujumbura, police and hospital sources said on Friday. Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye told reporters one person died at the scene and 29 others were rushed to hospital after grenades were thrown into two bars in the Buyenzi district on Thursday night. Hospital sources said two people died of their injuries later. One survivor, who asked not to be named, said the attackers had not attempted to rob the bars or the patrons.

Burundi has suffered from periodic low-level violence since 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to seek a third term in office. Opponents said his candidacy violated the constitution and a peace agreement that ended a civil war in 2005. The opposition mostly boycotted the polls and Nkurunziza won a third term.

A wave of unrest followed. The International Criminal Court said it left about 450 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee. Since then, political violence has continued to simmer. Earlier this month, attackers targeted another bar in the same district, causing two deaths and wounding four.

The United States on Thursday offered its assistance to Spain in the wake of a deadly van attack in Barcelona’s most popular street Las Ramblas, which left at least two dead. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city, and urged US nationals to check in with their families.

“Terrorists around the world should know — the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,” Tillerson told a press conference with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and their Japanese counterparts.

Fiorentina striker Nikola Kalinic missed Thursday’s training session without giving a reason for his absence, the Serie A club said in a statement (it.violachannel.tv).

“The player (Kalinic), having violated the norms that discipline the team activity, will be sanctioned according to the rules,” said the Florentine club.

Fiorentina allowed the Croatia international to leave their summer training camp twice earlier in July due to serious family issues, including a robbery.

Kalinic told Sky Italia last month that he knew that Serie A rivals AC Milan were interested in signing him and that he wanted to join the club.

Giovanni Simeone, another forward, joined Fiorentina on Wednesday from Genoa.

Police and security forces on Friday conducted area domination march in various parts of Darjeeling on the 65th day of the indefinite shutdown. Though no incident of violence has been reported since Thursday night, the police and security personnel have been keeping a tight vigil, a senior police officer said.

The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), which is spearheading the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland, took out rallies in various parts of the hills. They demanded the restoration of internet services, which was cut off in the hills since June 18, besides an immediate withdrawal of security forces from Darjeeling.

The GJM activists and NGOs were seen distributing food among the locals as food supply has been severely hit due to the prolonged shutdown. Barring medicine shops, all other commercial establishments, schools and colleges remained shut.

After a terrorist attack in Barcelona killed 14 people and injured more than 100 as a van rammed into a crowd of people in one of the most famous tourist spots of the city, La Liga clubs across Spain held a minute of silence on Friday to show their respect and offer condolences to the families of victims.

“Before the training this morning many teams have kept a minute of silence for what happened yesterday in Barcelona,” said a La Liga fan page on Twitter, as they put up pictures of various teams huddled together in a circle and saying their prayers.

Among those to offer their sympathies was the city’s own club – Barcelona FC, who held a minute’s silence before training for their first league match this season to pay tribute to those affected. Club President Josep Maria Bartomeu and Directors Vilanova and Teixidor represented the Club at Pl.Catalunya as the city offered prayers to the victims of the terror attack.

The Catalans club has also taken the decision to to pause before their first league game of the season against Real Betis at Camp Nou on Sunday to honour those who lost their lives in the attack.

Ronald Koeman backs record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost Everton attack,"Ronald Koeman also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered. (Source: File) Ronald Koeman also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered. (Source: File)

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said he expects Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost the club’s goal-scoring options after the attacking-midfielder completed his medical before he transfers from Swansea City.

Sigurdsson will move to Goodison Park after the two clubs agreed on a fee of about 45 million pounds ($57.84 million), a record for Everton, according to the British media.

The 27-year-old played a key part in Swansea’s avoiding relegation last season, scoring nine goals and 13 assists. “The latest is that he had his medical this morning. What I heard from the doctor was no problem,” Koeman told a news conference before the Europa League first-leg playoff against Croatian side Hajduk Split on Thursday.

“We worked a long time to get this deal in and he was one of the key players to bring in. We knew would lose Lukaku for this season and we need players who bring productivity to the team.

Romelu Lukaku moved to Manchester United last month, for a reported transfer fee of 75 million pounds. Sigurdsson “is the type of player with a lot of productivity, Koeman said. “In my opinion, he is one of the best in the Premier League.”

The manager also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered in training last week.

Barkley, who is in the final year of his contract, refused a new deal at the club and Koeman said last month he would be sold in the current transfer window.

“He stopped training last Monday,” Koeman said. “It looks like a hamstring injury, but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.”

Following their Europa League encounter at Goodison Park, Everton visit Manchester City in the league on Monday.

"Donald Trump condemns Barcelona terrorist attack, offers aid","US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

US President Donald Trump has strongly condemned the Barcelona terrorist attack claimed by the Islamic State group in which at least 13 people were killed and another hundred were injured. A van driver yesterday ploughed into crowds of pedestrians on Barcelona’s most popular street in broad daylight. “The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!” Trump said in a tweet yesterday.

In another tweet, he referred to an American general for taking tough attitude towards terrorists. “Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more radical Islamic terror for 35 years!”

US Vice President Mike Pence described this as a tragic day and warned the perpetrators of the terrorist attack. “This latest attack, the worst terror attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, shows us again that radical Islamic terrorism is one of the greatest threats that we face in the world … Whoever is responsible should know that the US, together with our allies, will find and punish those responsible, and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the earth,” he said.

Pence said this at a joint press conference with the president of Panama where he is travelling now. “This is a tragic day, and the latest scenes of carnage and mayhem sicken us all…People in Barcelona should know, our prayers and the prayers of all of the American people, are with the victims and their families, and all the good people of Spain,” he said.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the US is monitoring the situation and the country is ready to assist law enforcement and national security authorities in Spain. “Our consulates in Barcelona and our entire Mission Spain team are currently assisting Americans in Spain who are affected by these events. We ask US citizens in the area to let your loved ones know you are safe. Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,” he said.

Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said all Americans are horrified and saddened by the news of the vicious terror attack in Barcelona. “Terrorists will not break our strength or our spirit. While we wait for further news, may the people of Barcelona know that the United States stands in solidarity with them at this dark hour. The US will continue to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Spain against the vile scourge of terror,” she said.

It’s horrific to again see graphic images of innocent victims hit by a car that was driven by hate, Senator Dianne Feinstein said. “This attack is yet another reminder that we must do more to combat all forms of extremism. Terrorists need to be identified and stopped before they are able to commit an attack,” she said.

Condemning the attack, Congressman Eliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said: “In the days ahead, the United States will stand with our ally as authorities investigate what happened and work to bring all those responsible to justice.” “The brutal and cowardly attack on innocent people at Las Ramblas today is a reminder that we are all obligated to stand against violence and hatred wherever it lives,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

“The perpetrators of this heinous attack must be brought to justice, and we will not rest until the purveyors of hate and terror around the world are defeated,” said the House Democratic Whip Steny H Hoyer. Two suspects of the deadly attack, identified as a Spaniard and a Moroccan, have been arrested but the driver is still on the run.

"I think Virat Kohli has a lot of Australian spirit in him, says Michael Clarke","Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP) Australia would be playing an ODI series in India, next month. (Source: AP)

Former Australian captain Michael Clarke believes that Indian captain skipper Virat Kohli is often misunderstood for his on-field reactions. Stating that he has enormous respect for the Indian skipper Clarke also revealed that Kohli has quite a fans in Australia as well.

Addressing the media, Clarke said, “I disagree that Virat doesn’t have too many fans in Australia. I think Virat has a lot of Australian spirit in him” and added, “To be honest, he plays the game really tough and is really competitive on the field, but he is a nice guy off the field. So when people get to know Virat, they realize that what they see on the field is just his competitive spirit. I can’t think of any Australian cricketer who wasn’t like that every time we walked out on the field. I certainly think there is respect for Virat in Australia.”

Speaking on how the Australian media views him, Clarke said, “You probably are not going to read the positive stuff (about Virat) in the Australian media though. They all want to write a negative story. But I have a great relationship with him and I think he is respectful.”

Meanwhile, with the end of pay dispute controversy, Clarke believes that the focus is now on cricket. Expressing delight, he said, “It is fantastic that the deal has been done and everybody can focus on cricket. Australia will be traveling to Bangladesh very soon and then we come to India and then the Ashes, so it is wonderful that the game can now move forward. The players can focus on what they do the best – playing – and the administrators can do their job too. I think everybody is sick and tired of talking about it and very happy that it’s over.”

However, Clarke refrained from taking any sides and said, “I don’t need to take sides. There have been compromises from both the parties, but now I am glad the focus is back on cricket.”

Leonardo Bonucci hoping for the Andrea Pirlo effect after moving to AC Milan,"Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. (Source: AP File) Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. (Source: AP File)

Not many players make the switch from AC Milan directly to Juventus, or vice versa. But Leonardo Bonucci hopes to prove as effective as another that did: Andrea Pirlo.

After winning the Serie A title with Milan in 2011, Pirlo moved to Juventus on a free transfer and kick-started the Bianconeri’s domination of Italian soccer, winning four more league trophies before moving to Major League Soccer in 2015.

Bonucci has gone the other way, joining Milan for a fee of more than 40 million euros ($45 million) after winning six straight Serie A titles with Juventus.

“I hope to do with Milan what Pirlo did with Juve,” Bonucci said in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.

Like Pirlo, Bonucci has now played for the three biggest clubs in the country. The Italy defender made his Serie A debut with Inter Milan in May 2006.

Bonucci joined Juventus in 2010 from Bari and was a key part of its rebuilding, becoming Italy’s top defender in the process. The 30-year-old Bonucci wants to do the same at Milan, but with even more success.

“I see a lot of parallels,” Bonucci said. “In fact, I chose Milan also because in my mind there is the idea of repeating the path I lived at Juventus, where we started from a reconstruction like is the case here, and ended up at the top.

“I want to go even higher here. Within four years I hope to manage to win the Champions League. I want to win everything.”

Juventus and Bonucci lost two Champions League finals in three years. Milan opens the season at Crotone on Sunday, with Bonucci as captain.

“It was a choice shared with the club, the coach and the squad,” Bonucci said. “I can make my charisma and experience available, but it’s the team that makes you that way. I’m lucky to have learned from great leaders like (Gianluigi) Buffon, (Alessandro) Del Piero and (Giorgio) Chiellini.”

U.S. President Donald Trump no doubt pleased part of his political base on Tuesday by passionately arguing that both right and left-wing extremists were responsible for violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia on Saturday. But his remarks, one day after he, under pressure, explicitly condemned neo Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, left White House officials bracing for fallout from disappointed Republicans whose support he needs to govern in the coming months and years.

“Your base isn’t going to win you re-election … nor is it going to keep you a majority in Congress,” said one administration official. It was political reality that the controversy over Trump’s response would last for some time, he said. The remarks at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday that sparked that reality at times bordered on the surreal.

Trump pulled out the statement he read on Saturday in an apparent effort to show, despite the subsequent criticism, that his initial instincts that “many sides” had been at fault were correct.

“What about the alt-left that came charging at the … alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?” he demanded, using terms that refer to right- and left-wing extremists.

He lashed out at the news media, a frequent foil, for its reporting about his reaction to the violence.

And he praised Susan Bro, the mother of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who died after a car driven by a man reported to have harbored Nazi sympathies ploughed into the rally opponents.

The praise, however, was for her warm remarks about Trump.

“Under the kind of stress that she’s under and the heartache that she’s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something,” the president said.

Trump’s political supporters embrace his style, and the Tuesday back-and-forth with reporters was an example of a characteristic that defines him, said a former adviser: a dislike for being criticized or pressured.

“When you push the president to do something, he’s not going to do it. He’s going to make a point not to do it,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide.

White House officials said time would tell how long the issue would remain in the headlines, and whether it would hurt Trump badly with legislators and others within his political base.

For now, the administration official said, the best strategy to deal with the fallout was to stay mum. “Let’s just put a pin in it, and you know, not tweet, not comment any further,” he said. “Right now explaining is losing.”

North Korea delays Guam missile firing; U.S. says dialogue up to Kim Jong Un,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (AP Photo) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (AP Photo)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has delayed a decision on firing missiles towards Guam while he waits to see what the United States does, the North’s state media reported on Tuesday as the United States said any dialogue was up to Kim. The United States and South Korea have prepared for more joint military drills, which has infuriated the North, and experts warned Pyongyang could still go ahead with a provocative plan.

In his first public appearance in about two weeks, Kim inspected the command of the North’s army on Monday, examining a plan to fire four missiles aimed at landing near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, the official KCNA news agency reported. “He said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the latter will make an important decision as it already declared,” KCNA said. The DPRK stands for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

In photos released with the KCNA report, Kim was seen holding a baton and pointing at a map showing a flight path for the missiles appearing to start from North Korea’s east coast, flying over Japan toward Guam. North Korea has often threatened to attack the United States and its bases and released similar photos in the past but never followed through.

Pyongyang’s latest threat prompted a surge in tensions in the region last week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying the U.S. military was “locked and loaded” if North Korea acted unwisely. But U.S. officials have taken a gentler tone in recent days. Asked by reporters on Tuesday about the North Korean delay, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it was up to Kim to decide if he wants to talk to the United States. “We continue to be interested in finding a way to get to dialogue but that’s up to him,” Tillerson told reporters.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea’s decision to hold off was not enough and Pyongyang would have to show it was “intent on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.” “I think they would have to do quite a bit more,” Nauert said, adding, “They know what they need to do to get us to come to the negotiating table.

Prevent War

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday his government would prevent war by all means. “Military action on the Korean peninsula can only be decided by South Korea and no one else can decide to take military action without the consent of South Korea,” Moon said in a speech to commemorate the anniversary of the nation’s liberation from Japanese military rule in 1945. “The government, putting everything on the line, will block war by all means,” Moon said.

The Liberation Day holiday, celebrated by both North and South, will be followed next week by joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. Asian shares rose for a second day on Tuesday after Kim’s comments. The U.S. dollar and Treasury yields climbed after solid U.S. retail data and the easing in U.S.-North Korean rhetoric.

North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes to ward off perceived U.S. hostility, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions. A new study by a London-based think tank and an article in the New York Times that cited it said North Korea had obtained rocket engines probably from a Ukrainian factory via illicit networks.

But U.S. intelligence officials said on Tuesday that North Korea has the ability to produce its own missile engines and intelligence suggests the country does not need to rely on imports. Japan will seek further reassurance from Washington in meetings between Japan’s defence chief and foreign minister and their U.S. counterparts on Thursday.

“The strategic environment is becoming harsher and we need to discuss how we will respond to that,” a Japanese foreign ministry official said in a briefing in Tokyo. “We will look for the U.S. to reaffirm its defence commitment, including the nuclear deterrent.” China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has repeatedly urged Pyongyang to halt its weapons programme and at the same time urged South Korea and the United States to stop military drills to lower tensions.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a telephone conversation with Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s minister for foreign affairs, said tensions on the Korean peninsula were showing some signs of easing but had not passed. The parties involved should “make a correct judgment and wise choice by taking a responsible attitude toward history and people,” Wang said, according to a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.

U.S. Senator Edward Markey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s panel on East Asia, announced on Tuesday he would lead a delegation to Korea, Japan and China, “The unity of purpose between the United States and our allies in South Korea, Japan, and China is critical in the face of Pyongyang’s increasing nuclear threat,” Markey said in a statement.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor and military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, urged caution in assuming North Korea was bluffing with its missile threats. “There is no stepping back for North Korea. Those who don’t know the North very well fall into this trap every time (thinking they are easing threats) but we’ve seen this before.”

The United States and South Korea remain technically at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. North Korea is currently holding three U.S. citizens it accuses of espionage or hostile acts, but now is not the right time to discuss them, KCNA reported, citing a foreign ministry spokesman. Pyongyang has used detainees to extract concessions, including high-profile visitors from the United States, which has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea.

Virat Kohli continues to top ICC ODI rankings for batsmen,"Virat Kohli has 873 points under his belt. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli has 873 points under his belt. (Source: AP)

India captain Virat Kohli continued to be the world’s top-ranked One-day batsman in the latest ICC ODI rankings, released in Dubai on Friday.

Having 873 points in his kitty, Kohli will have a chance to increase the 12-point lead over second-placed Australian David Warner at the upcoming five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Sunday.

Other Indian batsmen in the top-15 are former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (12th), Shikhar Dhawan (13th) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (14th).

However, no Indian bowler figure in the top-10 list. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (13th) is the lone Indian in top 15.

As for the ICC ODI Team Rankings, India are currently at number three and they would have to win the upcoming series at least by a 4-1 margin to ensure that they stay at that position, ahead of England.

At 114 points, India, even if win the series 3-2, will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will by eyeing the chance to seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 during the upcoming series.

The 1996 World Champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies.

The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30. Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ICC ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event, also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League.

The top two teams from this event will get to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points, while the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

However, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Caribbean side could edge it on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches.

The West Indies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 0-5 to India.

"Aakash Chopra goes down memory lane, shares pic with teammates from 2004 Pakistan tour","India defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a three-match Test series in 2004. (Source: Twitter) India defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a three-match Test series in 2004. (Source: Twitter)

Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra went down memory lane and shared a picture from India’s tour of Pakistan in 2004 where the Sourav Ganguly-led side won first ever Test series on Pakistan soil and created history. Chopra on his Twitter shared the picture and wrote, “Down the memory lane….2004 #Pakistan”

The team that toured Pakistan in 2004 was playing under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and his troops created history after winning the three-match Test series 2-1. In the first match, India stamped authority when they put on a total of 675/5 before declaring in Multan. Though Ganguly wasn’t the part of this particular Test match but it didn’t really effect India’s performance. Riding on a record-breaking triple hundred from Virender Sehwag, India took good control of the game in the beginning itself. Indian bowlers then bundled out Pakistan for 407 and 216 respectively to win the match by an innings and 52 runs.

In the second match in Lahore, the home side did bounce back. They bowled out India for 287 in first innings while scored 489 in reply. In second innings too, India were all out for 241 and Pakistan chased down the target by 9 wickets to square the series.

But in the deciding third game, India put on a phenomenal show. Pakistan were bundled out for 224 in first innings and India in reply scored a mammoth total of 600 runs after Rahul Dravid scored career best 270. Indian bowlers then cleaned up Pakistan batting line up to win the match by an innings and 131 runs.

Earlier, India also won the five-match ODI series 3-2.

Delhi police file case after dog killing video goes viral,"On asking a vegetable vendor and a security guard if they had seen the dog, she was told it was last spotted around 3 am. (Representational image) On asking a vegetable vendor and a security guard if they had seen the dog, she was told it was last spotted around 3 am. (Representational image)

After CCTV footage of a stray dog being bludgeoned to death by a man in Munirka Village went viral, police have registered a case at Vasant Vihar police station.

The matter was brought to light by Varun Mallik, an animal rights activist, who said the incident took place in the early hours of August 15. A resident of the area reported that the stray dog she used to feed was missing. “His name was Lulu. He used to come and sit in the opposite lane and I regularly fed him. On the morning of August 15, I saw a lot of blood in the streets and found Lulu missing,” she said.

On asking a vegetable vendor and a security guard if they had seen the dog, she was told it was last spotted around 3 am.

Later, she asked the local pradhan to look at CCTV footage in the area and found that around 4 am, some men walked towards the sleeping dog and one of them repeatedly hit it with a brick. The footage showed one person carrying it to the opposite lane and dumping it. After a while, he returned with a plastic bag, wrapped the dog and took it away.

The dog’s body has still not been recovered. The resident claimed several dogs in her area have gone missing. “I used to feed about 25 dogs in my area, now only 12 are left. Around a year ago, I had lost dogs in a similar way and had even complained to Maneka Gandhi after which the incidents stopped. Police did not take any action as they did not have CCTV footage of the incident, but now we have proof,” she said.

Police said they will conduct a manual surveillance to track down the accused.

Additional DCP (south) Chinmoy Biswal said the case has been registered under Section 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.

Indonesia race against time with pride on the line,"Indonesia has faced a race against time to be ready for the 18th Asian Games after original hosts Vietnam withdrew in 2014 due to financial problems. (Source: AP) Indonesia has faced a race against time to be ready for the 18th Asian Games after original hosts Vietnam withdrew in 2014 due to financial problems. (Source: AP)

On a dusty construction site in central Jakarta, amid sacks of cement and bulldozers, hundreds of high-vis clad workers toil away to bring Indonesia’s Asian Games dream to life.

Exactly one year out from the opening ceremony of the world’s largest multi-sport event after the Olympics, the city’s Gelora Bung Karno sports complex, which was built more than half a century ago, is undergoing a drastic renovation.

Jakarta and Palembang, on the island of Sumatra, will host around 10,000 thousand athletes from 45 countries competing in 39 sports from August 18 to September 2, 2018.

As the Asiad’s top venue hosting football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and archery the 55-year-old Gelora Bung Karno will be under intense scrutiny.

But despite the fast-approaching deadline, the man responsible for upgrading the complex’s main stadium, Wikrama Wardana, recently told AFP there was still plenty of time to complete the job.

“We are going to do our best to finish it within the timeframe. Once the contract has ended, there will be enough time to prepare for the Asian Games more thoroughly,” Wardana said at the arena.

Indonesia has faced a race against time to be ready for the 18th Asian Games after original hosts Vietnam withdrew in 2014 due to financial problems, meaning the country has only had four years to prepare instead of the usual six.

It last hosted the Asian Games in 1962 in Jakarta, and for many Indonesians the Games will be the perfect chance to showcase the country’s sporting prowess, as well as its status as one of the world’s emerging economies.

But when the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) visited Indonesia in March, it warned the country it faced huge challenges, raising concerns about a lack of coordination between bodies carrying out different tasks, such as those building venues, organising the lighting and sound systems.

Observers from OCA have also raised questions about the suitability of the athletes’ village and transport to and from venues in a city notorious for major traffic congestion.

In another setback, Jakarta’s landmark Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train system won’t be ready until 2019, meaning fans will have to navigate the traffic-choked streets by taxi, motorbike or clapped-out bus.

However, Indonesia’s Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi has hit back at the criticism, saying the country should be praised for hosting the games at such short notice.

“Actually they have to thank Indonesia because Indonesia saved this Asian Games,” he told AFP, adding the pace of development was clearly visible.

But beyond the clatter of machinery at Jakarta’s top sporting complex, there are few clues the city is about to host its first Asian Games in 50 years.

Marketing for the event is conspicuously absent and, despite a budget of about four trillion rupiah ($300 million), awareness seems to be limited, if not non-existent, among residents.

“I didn’t know Indonesia will host it. I rarely watch the news and read newspapers,” Linggar Rysandika, 25, told AFP while waiting for a bus next to the unfinished softball venue.

Preparation for the event is more advanced in Palembang, which held the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in 2011.

Much of the infrastructure needed to cater for the flood of athletes and visitors is already in place, but organisers will be keen to avoid repeating the controversies of that event.

The 2011 SEA Games were tarnished by a major corruption scandal, transport delays, incomplete infrastructure and a deadly stampede at the football final.

Palembang successfully hosted the Asian Triathlon Championship earlier this year, and is busy building a light railway from the city’s airport to the main Jakabaring Sport City.

But back in Jakarta, observers have flagged up several potential pitfalls.

When representatives from the OCA’s medical services committee and anti-doping commission visited earlier this month, they raised issues about the apartment complex which is due to house athletes.

The master plan for the eight-block complex, which is still under construction, shows athletes will have lengthy walks through Jakarta’s hot and often-polluted air just to reach their transportation stops.

Dr Jegathesan Manikavasagam, chairman of the medical services committee, said athletes will be expending energy before they even get to their events.

“This will be a big problem, you will get many complaints,” Manikavasagam said.

Despite all the question marks, when Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo officially launches the year-to-go countdown on Friday evening it will be a moment of immense pride for the nation of more than 250 million people.

Gatot Dewa Broto, vice-president of the Indonesian Asian Games Organisation Committee (INASGOC), insisted things were on track, but admitted there was some way to go.

“We still need to seal deals with sponsors and then later determine things like ticket prices, but I don’t think there are problems with the venues,” he said.

“We are working non-stop, this is just a matter of time, it’s very short.”

"Internet firms shift stance, move to exile white supremacists","Earlier this week, Facebook Inc removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. (File) Earlier this week, Facebook Inc removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. (File)

Silicon Valley joined a swelling backlash against neo-Nazi groups in the United States on Wednesday as more technology companies removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Social media networks Twitter Inc and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc were among the companies cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.

Earlier in the week, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and GoDaddy Inc also took steps to block hate groups.

The wave of internet crackdowns against white nationalists and neo-Nazis reflected a rapidly changing mindset among Silicon Valley firms on how far they are willing to go to police hate speech.

Tech companies have taken down violent propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups, in part in response to government pressure. But most internet companies have traditionally tried to steer clear of making judgments about content except in cases of illegal activity.

Cloudflare, which protects some 6 million websites from denial-of-service attacks and hacking, on Wednesday afternoon dropped coverage of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer.

“I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet,” Cloudflare founder and Chief Executive Matthew Prince said in an email to employees.

Cloudflare is well-known for defending even the most distasteful websites, and services like it are essential to the functioning of websites.

Daily Stormer helped organize the weekend rally in Charlottesville where a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a man plowed a car into a crowd protesting the white nationalist gathering.

Daily Stormer has been accessible only intermittently the past few days after domain providers GoDaddy and Google Domains, a unit of Alphabet, said they would not serve the website.

By Wednesday, Daily Stormer had moved to a Russia-based internet domain, with an address ending in .ru. Later in the day, though, the site was no longer accessible at that address.

Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin said on a social network used by many of his supporters, Gab, that his site would be back soon.

“The Cloudflare betrayal adds another layer of super complexity. But we got this,” he said. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.

Prince, the Cloudflare chief executive, said in an interview that despite his decision he was conflicted, because it could become harder to resist pressure from governments to censor.

“You don’t have to play this game too many moves out to see how risky this is going to be,” Prince said. “‘What about this site? What about this site?'”

Only the biggest companies will be able to navigate the varying laws in different countries, he added. “We’ve lost a lot of the fight for a free and open internet.”

Twitter on Wednesday suspended accounts linked to Daily Stormer. The company said it would not discuss individual accounts, but at least three affiliated with the Daily Stormer led to pages saying “account suspended.”

The social network prohibits violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct and “will take action on accounts violating those policies,” the company said in a statement.

Larger rival Facebook Inc, which unlike Twitter explicitly prohibits hate speech, has taken down several pages from Facebook and Instagram in recent days that it said were associated with hate speech or hate organizations. It also took down the event page that was used to promote and organize the “Unite the Right” rally.

“With the potential for more rallies, we’re watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.

Facebook also said it had removed accounts belonging to Chris Cantwell, a web commentator who has described himself as a white nationalist and said on his site that he had attended the Charlottesville rally. Cantwell’s YouTube account also appeared to have been terminated.

Cantwell could not immediately be reached for comment.

LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp, suspended a page devoted to Daily Stormer and another page belonging to a man associated with the site, Andrew Auernheimer. LinkedIn declined to comment.

Reddit this week eliminated one of its discussion communities that supported the Unite the Right rally, saying that the company would ban users who incite violence. The company says it has more than 250 million users.

Spotify, based in Sweden, said it was in the process of removing musical acts from its streaming service that had been flagged as racist “hate bands” by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

“Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us,” the company said in a statement, adding that record companies should also be held responsible.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres — dominated by non-fiction — August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing — and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can’t wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 — but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound — the fiction in “The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told” will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia’s challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history — the old saga of blood, sweat and tears — about to resume its course?

* The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

A masterful and entirely fresh portrait of great hopes and dashed dreams from a major new literary voice. “Everything that could possibly be wrong with a city was wrong with Calcutta” — and yet, after completing his education in the US, Choudhury embodied his parents’ greatest fears by returning to the city they escaped for a better life. Sifting through the chaos and decay for the stories that are ignored by the papers, that don’t fall into any reporter’s beat, “The Epic City” is a soulful, insightful and meticulously researched account of everyday lives and an extraordinary portrait of a city which is a world unto itself.

* India: Priorities for the Future by Bimal Jalan (Penguin)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan’s formidable analysis of the last four decades of India’s economic journey illuminates the nation’s transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on this vast experience, he compares two distinct periods — 1980-2000 and 2000-15 — to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

"I-Day speech censoring undemocratic, authoritarian, expression of intolerance: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar","Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar inspects 71st Independence Day parade in Agartala. (Source: PTI Photo) Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar inspects 71st Independence Day parade in Agartala. (Source: PTI Photo)

Tripura CM Manik Sarkar speaks to The Indian Express about Prasar Bharati not broadcasting his speech

Q. How do you see Prasar Bharati’s decision not to broadcast you Independence Day message on Doordarshan and AIR?

A. This is thoroughly undemocratic, authoritarian and expression of intolerance.

Q. Why do you call it an expression of intolerance?

A. Because in the speech, what they have mentioned is that it not befitting the gravity of a national Independence Day. I do not know how they came to this conclusion. National Independence Day, in my humble experience, is not just a simple ritual function. It is a day for national introspection. What were the aims and objectives of the struggle for freedom? Our freedom fighters, they had some dreams. So on this particular day, it is the job of the citizens of the nation to go for introspection to assess the objectives, aims, dreams and how far it has been translated into action at the grassroots level. Where are the gaps and why there are gaps. How to bridge all these things to achieve our objectives and goals. All these things will have to be done. Keeping that in mind, I made two-three points in my speech. In this situation, how have they come to this conclusion that it is not befitting the gravity of national Independence Day. Who are they to assess all these things. And they have asked a Chief Minister to reshape his speech. They have crossed all limits. This is not proper. This is actually nothing but gagging, not the Chief Minister alone. They are going to gag civil liberties. That cannot be done. This is wrong.

Q. CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has called this an attack on federalism. He said all the the non-BJP state governments should join together to save centre-state relations as envisaged in the Constitution and spoke about getting in touch with Chief Ministers. Have you spoken to any of the non-BJP chief ministers?

A. No, I have not spoken. At this moment, I am not thinking. What I have done, in my humble view, is to bring to the notice of common people what is going on in our country and society just to make them aware of what is going on. A lurking danger is there. I though that if I had kept mum, it would not be proper. That is why I have done it.

Q. Prasar Bharati stressed on the solemnity of the occasion. The counter argument is that you gave a political speech?

A. Independence Day is a political day. What is it? On that particular day, the speech must be political. That will depend on the understanding of the person who is making the speech. I thought it is a political day, my speech must be political. More so, I am a political worker. What is wrong in it?

Q. You must have given Independence Day messages in the past also. What was the difference then and now?

A. Not like this. Last year the situation was different. Year before last, the situation was different. Factoring the relevance of the ongoing situation, I make my points. Last year, this sort of speech was not delivered. It was in a question-answer format.

Q. What has changed in the last one year?

A. I have dealt with that in my speech.

Q. Three years have passed since the BJP came to power. The perception is that BJP is gaining from strength to strength if one go by its electoral successes and the opposition appears to be weakening or in disarray? Even today, the BJP came second in municipal elections in West Bengal.

A. People of Bengal could not find the opportunity to exercise their franchise. That is the reality. About the national situation, if everything is alright….what happened last month…more than 200 districts of the farming community? States which are run by the BJP. What about the working class…. Recently in Talkatora stadium they had a national convention…. Thousands of people assembled there and they declared their programme. In the coming days, they are going to organise a big demonstration. On what issue? What is going on in the universities, on college campuses. The minority, trading community, everybody is aggrieved. What is going on. Lakhs and lakhs are losing their jobs and crores and crores of people are actually joining the queue for jobs. And where are the jobs? So, it is a mirage. This is the situation. On all this, people have started voicing their resentment and that is why coming out into the streets and movements have started taking shape. From all this experience, one can easily draw a conclusion about what is going on. In this situation, if anybody thinks that by gagging X or Y, he will be in a safe position, it will not happen. People cannot be suppressed this way.

Q. The BJP is aggressively reaching out to the tribal community. Does that worry you? It has tasted success in several northeastern states already.

A. It has been going on since long. Slogans of independent states were raised. Ouster of foreigners — that slogan was raised. Communal tension was mounted, riots were also organised. The people of Tripura fought back all these, got peace, tranquility, strengthened democracy and taken it to the grassroots…. As far as northeastern states (are concerned), Tripura is Tripura. The state cannot be equated with any other state. Every state has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses…. So one state cannot be equated with another.

Q. The BJP is making an aggressive bid in Tripura. How confident are you about the coming election?

A. We have full confidence in our people and people have their confidence on us. Because we are not doing anything against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state. That is why we have that confidence. People will act according to their experience in daily life.

Q. What should the opposition do now? At the national level there is talk about opposition unity.

A. Unity cannot develop without an alternative set of policies. Even if the set of policies are identified, unity will not develop until and unless to achieve these policies… there is an united struggle. Unity cannot develop only between the leaders, discussion, arriving at certain understanding and conclusions. That has to be taken to the grassroots. People have been facing, they have been suffering, they should be mobilised on the ground itself. Mass struggle, class struggle ceaselessly on the basis of alternative set of policies.

Q. How is it possible with parties which have different sets of ideologies and policies?

A. That is there. That understanding, unity of understanding on each and every issue, that cannot be, may not be (possible). Issues may very, very limited but let us start with this. Wherever we have an understanding, let us start with that. That way, gradually it will develop.

Q. Is it possible for the CPM to have an understanding with the Congress or for that matter, Trinamool Congress?

A. If the Congress changes its economic policies, then that can be thought of. If they stick to their earlier position, because of which they have been ousted from the seat of power, what they have lost they will further lose. They shall also have to apply their mind to this particular aspect. We cannot advise the Congress. It is the leadership of the Congress. They shall have to think about it. We can at best express our mind. If they change, then people at the grassroots level will decide.

Q. So is that a pre-condition for unity?

A. This policy — neo-liberal economic policy — that has created all this disaster. It is being implemented in an aggressive manner by the present government. That is causing a lot of problems — working class, peasantry, youth, students, SC/STs, small and marginal traders. Only a small minority, the corporate sector, is benefiting. Good days have come for them. Others are under attack either in this way or that way. Under this situation, the political parties all of a sudden cannot change. But if gradually, issue by issue, they start thinking about all these things… then only it (unity) can develop.

Q. At a critical time when the opposition should be unitedly taking on the Government in Parliament, it was amusing to see that your party decided to keep one of your most powerful speakers, Sitaram Yechury, out of Parliament. Why did you do that?

A. That was a party decision. That has been explained. That is my view also

Q. But many leaders in the opposition were surprised when they heard that Yechury would not be returning to Rajya Sabha

A. Sitaram Yechury is our general secretary. Yes he is not there in Parliament. What is that. But he is there in our party headquarters. He is moving around in states. He is moving around the country. What is the problem. He can actually deliver goods, he can take the message to the people.

Q. Shouldn’t the rigidity in our party end?

A. This is not rigidity. Actually he is the party general secretary and we thought he should give more time to the party organisation and other political activities. Nothing else. About his quality, he has proved in the floor of Parliament. About that nobody is raising any questions. That is appreciated. But party thought that he should give more time to the party organisation and other political activities. And that is what he has been doing.

Vadodara residents displaced by demolition to restart stir,"A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File) A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File)

Close to six months after an in situ rehabilitation project under Rajiv Awas Yojana for the displaced of a November 2014 demolition drive in Kalyannagar here was stalled for want of funds — as claimed by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) — the 550 families, mostly Muslims, are gearing up to restart their agitation for “justice”.

The VMC has, however, proposed the residents to consider relocation to Tandalja, which the families see as being “pushed into a Muslim ghetto”. Besides, they claim that the VMC has not given their rental allowance for June and July.

In a memorandum submitted to Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Vinod Rao on Tuesday, their representative J S Bandukwala demanded that their rehabilitation be done in accordance to the word given by the VMC and the local MLAs in 2015.

Bandukwala also raised the issue of rents. “Most families are poor and pay high rents in Fatehgunj, Gorwa and Navayard.” The memorandum reminded the VMC of maladministration and possible corruption in the use of funds meant for construction of the in situ homes, as cited by the civic body, bringing the project to a halt.

Rao had instituted an inquiry against F J Charpot, then executive engineer of affordable housing scheme, for escalation in the project cost, which went up from Rs 80 crore to Rs 150 crore.

When contacted, Rao said, “The discussion (about shifting the families to Tandalja) is on. Some families have agreed to shift and others will agree in coming days.”

Regarding the site at Kalyannagar, Rao said, “We will have to begin a process for cost recovery through auctioning. Any party, who is interested in completing the project, will be considered so that the project can be put to use.”

Asola sanctuary incident: Surajkund police station sub-inspector suspended for allegedly harassing students,"The sub-inspector of Surajkund police station in Faridabad was suspended on Friday following allegations by seven students that local police did not help them after the incident at Asola Wildlife Sanctuary and forced them to tender a written apology, as per ANI reports. The sub-inspector was suspended for negligence of duty, said the Commissioner of Police, Faridabad. Seven students, including three from JNU, were allegedly beaten up by a group of people at Asola Wildlife Sanctuary in Faridabad on August 14 evening. The students said the attackers also “molested” a female student when they resisted.

The students lodged a “zero FIR’ — registered at a different location than the incident — at south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj North police station on Wednesday, which transferred it to the police station in Faridabad.

The complaint that was made by the girl read, “Around 8.30 pm, while returning to our campus, we were intercepted by three men there. They asked the relationship between me and the boys.” Soon, they grew violent and 8-9 people gathered. “They started assaulting us and hurled abuses,” the complaint said, adding that the ordeal lasted two hours and they were rescued by two locals.

Earlier on Friday, the JNU Students Union condemned the Haryana Police for allegedly harassing the students who wanted to file a complaint. JNUSU president Mohit Kumar Pandey said the union would approach the Faridabad commissioner of police seeking action against Surajkund police and the mob. “This reflects the environment of fear that is being created in the country. The goons openly threatened the girl and abused the boys. Now see the pathetic condition of Haryana Police that instead of helping victims, they behaved in the same way these goons were behaving,” Pandey said.

All for a good cause: This cafe in Australia charges male customers 18 per cent ‘man tax’,"The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter) The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter)

If you are in Melbourne, Australia and happen to look for a vegan cafe, then you can head to Handsome Her. But if you’re a man, be prepared to end up paying more than the female customers. Yes, the cafe levies a surcharge on male customers, but there’s a powerful message behind it.

No one likes paying more taxes based on their gender, right? Then how are people okay with the pay gap based on gender? It’s a known fact that around the world there is a big difference in the remuneration received by men and women. From entertainment industry to big enterprises, many are guilty of practising the vice.

The ‘man tax’ paid at this cafe is to highlight the disparities in pay scale. The male customers are expected to pay a surcharge fixed at 18 per cent but it’s not compulsory or asked every day. The additional cost is levied only once a week, per month.

The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien. She says her restaurant is ‘for women, by women’ but men are always welcome. The main motive behind this move is to start a conversation over the issue of gender equality in the workplace. Talking to the Daily Mirror, O’Brien said, “If men don’t want to pay it, we’re not going to kick them out the door. It’s just an opportunity to do some good.”

She describes herself as a “feminist, not the fun kind”, and added: “We’re bringing it [the gender pay gap] to the forefront of people’s minds. I like that it is making men stop and question their privilege a little bit.”

According to the report by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which used Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2016, it stated that the full-time gender pay gap is around 18 per cent. And no, the extra earning is not stashed away, it is donated to charities.

“Alex plans to rotate them four times a year. In August, the earnings will go to an organisation called Elizabeth Morgan House, which helps Aboriginal women and children,” the report added.

Many have praised her for her meaningful initiative.

"Marco Asensio is going to cause a real stir, says Zinedine Zidane","Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year. (Source: Reuters) Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona were given a painful reminder of what they missed out on by failing to sign Marco Asensio after the Spanish youngster’s long range strike set Real Madrid on their way to a 2-0 win over the Catalans on Wednesday to seal the Spanish Super Cup.

The Spain under-21 international had the Santiago Bernabeu crowd screaming with delight after his stunning goal in the fourth minute, adding to his 90th minute thunderbolt which had sealed a 3-1 win for Madrid in the first leg at the Nou Camp.

Karim Benzema added a second shortly before half-time to give Real a 5-1 aggregate win, which was richly deserved and led Barca defender Gerard Pique to declare he felt inferior to Real for the first time in 10 years.

Asensio’s contribution to Real’s dominance over the two legs was even more painful for Barca as they had let the former Mallorca forward slip from their grasp three years ago, according to the Spaniard’s agent Horacio Gaggioli.

Gaggioli said in an interview with website Bleacher Report that in the summer of 2014 Barca refused to pay the 4.5 million euros ($5.2 million) Mallorca were asking for Asensio up front, preferring to pay in two installments, leaving Madrid to snap him up later in the year for a reported 3.9 million euros.

Asensio spent the first year after his transfer on loan at Espanyol. But he has made the most of the chances given since returning to Real at the start of last season and on Sunday became the first player in the club’s history to score in five of his competition debuts.

Asensio has struck on his Liga, King’s Cup, Champions League, European Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup debuts for Real, also netting against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals and grabbing the final goal in Real’s 4-1 win over Juventus in the final.

Asensio was limited to 11 Liga starts last season but is set for a far bigger role this year.

“When I saw his goal my jaw dropped,” said Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos, a teammate of Asensio with Spain’s under-21 side.

“What Marco keeps doing does not surprise me, I have known him for three years. He has the talent to keep doing what he’s doing in big games and against great teams.”

Coach Zinedine Zidane added: “Asensio is going to cause a real stir.”

Vijay Kumar, India’s one of the finest shooter, believes that Indian shooters will improve their performance than last year’s Rio Olympics and perform well in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

There were a lot of hopes from Indian shooters during 2016 Olympics, but the shooters were not able to live up to the expectations as the 12-member team could not even clinch one medal. Vijay is now hopeful that shooters will forget their Rio performance and will give their best in the 2020 Olympics.

Speaking to reporters in Indore, Vijay said,”I think in 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the country’s shooters will perform their best. Since 2004, the performance of the country’s shooters has been improving. Though we did not win any medal in 2016 Olympics, some of the shooters went till the last round of their respective events and performed well.”

Vijay said that he is training at his best with coaches, to give a much more improved performance in the 2020 Olympics. But Vijay’s primary focus is the next Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Australia in 2018 and also the Asian Games, which will take place in the same year in Indonesia.

A state-level shooting competition was organised at Emerald Heights School, and for its inauguration, Vijay was called by the school. An inter-school shooting competition is also being held along with this tournament.

Hong Kong democracy leader defiant as three jailed for months,"An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday. (Representational Image) An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday. (Representational Image)

An appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday, dealing a blow to the Chinese-ruled city’s youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference. Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 24, and Nathan Law, 26, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but Hong Kong’s Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

Wong was jailed for six months, Chow for seven months and Law for eight months. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit. The three appeared stern but calm as their sentences were delivered by a panel of three judges.

The former British colony, which has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by nearly three months of mostly peaceful street occupations in late 2014, demanding Beijing grant the city full democracy. The so-called “Umbrella Movement” civil disobedience movement, that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters at its peak, was triggered after Wong and his colleagues stormed into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters.

They were later charged with participating in and inciting an unlawful assembly. Just before sentencing, a defiant Wong told around one hundred supporters who thronged into the High Court lobby, some weeping, that he had no regrets and urged them to keep fighting for full democracy.

“I hope Hong Kong people won’t give up. Victory is ours. When we are released next year I hope we can see a Hong Kong that is full of hope. I want to see Hong Kong people not giving up. This is my last wish before I go to jail.” Wong also told Reuters earlier that Hong Kong’s democratic movement was facing its “darkest era” and that he’d lost confidence in the city’s vaunted legal system, long considered one of the best in Asia.

The Department of Justice said in an earlier statement that the trio were not convicted for exercising their civil liberties, but because their conduct during the protest included “disorderly and intimidating behaviour”. It added there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive”.

Critics disagreed

“The outlandish application seeking jail time is not about public order but is instead a craven political move to keep the trio out of the Legislative Council, as well as deter future protests,” China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement on Wednesday. Hong Kong enjoys a free judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

The jail terms will curtail the political ambitions of the trio, barring them for running for seats in the legislature for the next five years. In recent months, dozens of protesters, mostly young people, have been jailed for their roles in various protests, including a violent demonstration that the government called a riot in early 2016.

"Gylfi Sigurdsson move can fund future Swansea transfers, says Paul Clement","Everton says it has signed Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea for a club-record fee, further strengthening the team’s attacking options to compensate for the departure of striker Romelu Lukaku. (Source: AP) Everton says it has signed Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea for a club-record fee, further strengthening the team’s attacking options to compensate for the departure of striker Romelu Lukaku. (Source: AP)

Swansea City can use the funds generated from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s move to Premier League rivals Everton to sign two or three more players, manager Paul Clement said ahead of Saturday’s home game against Manchester United.

Iceland midfielder Sigurdsson, who played a key part in the Welsh club avoiding relegation last season, completed his move to Everton on Wednesday with British media reporting the fee to be around 45 million pounds ($57.96 million).

“I spoke to them (chairman and owners) last night about what we will do moving forward. Funds are available to strengthen the squad,” Clement told reporters on Thursday.

“It’s a big challenge, no question. We hope we can potentially bring in two or three players to strengthen us in various positions.”

Swansea have been linked with multiple players as they look to avoid another relegation scrap and Clement says that the club are keen to bolster the squad quickly but will not pay massive fees.

“We have multiple targets because things do not always come off, you have to move to other players in that situation,” he said. “We have to move swiftly, time is important but we will not panic. Sometimes the deals can be better in the last days.

“We have to make sure any player we bring in comes at the valuation we want, we will not pay over the odds. We have cast the net wide… you have to look far and wide for good value.”

Swansea were held to a goalless draw at Southampton while United beat West Ham United 4-0 on the opening weekend of the season. However, Clement is confident that his team can come out on top against Jose Mourinho’s side, as they have recorded two wins and a draw in their last five league games against United.

“(We’re) Excited, what a nice first game back at the Liberty. We had a good game at Old Trafford but we are different and so are they,” Clement said.

“They have started well and brought in some good players but we are confident because of what we did last season and our record against them is quite encouraging. We are looking forward to it and expect a really good atmosphere.”

"Rex Tillerson raps some US allies for religious freedom violations, slams IS","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (AP Photo/ File) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (AP Photo/ File)

US allies including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain did not uphold principles of religious freedom in 2016, while Islamic State has carried out “genocide” against religious minorities, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday. Tillerson made the comments at the State Department while introducing the agency’s annual report on religious freedom, required by a 1998 act of Congress. The report is the first to be released during the Trump administration and covers 2016.

Saudi Arabia, Tillerson said, ought to “embrace greater degrees of religious freedom for all of its citizens.” He cited criminal penalties for apostasy, atheism, blasphemy, and insulting the Saudi state’s interpretation of Islam, as well as attacks and discrimination targeting Shi’ite Muslims. The kingdom follows the strict Sunni Muslim Wahhabi school of Islam.

The report said Saudi Arabia has used counter-terrorism laws to target atheists and Shi’ite Muslims. The United States and Saudi Arabia have long been close partners in counter-terrorism efforts and the kingdom was the first stop on US President Donald Trump’s maiden international visit. Tillerson singled out another Gulf Arab state, Bahrain, saying it “must stop discriminating against the Shia communities.”

In Turkey, a NATO ally, “authorities continued to limit the human rights of members of some religious minority groups,” Tillerson said. American pastor Andrew Brunson has been jailed in Turkey since October on charges of being part of a terrorist organization, according to news reports. Tillerson said religious freedom is “under attack” in Pakistan, citing the marginalization of Ahmadiyya Muslims, a minority sect which Pakistan considers non-Muslim.

Tillerson said Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group that has controlled parts of Iraq and Syria, “is clearly responsible for genocide against Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in areas it controls or has controlled.” Tillerson said Iran targeted religious minorities including Baha’is and Christians, and in 2016 executed 20 people on charges including “waging war against God.” He also called out China and Sudan in his remarks.

The Chinese government tortures and imprisons thousands for practicing their religious beliefs, Tillerson said, citing the targeting of Falun Gong members, Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists. And in Sudan, the government arrests and intimidates clergy and blocks the construction of churches while tearing down existing ones, he said.

Tillerson’s decision to introduce the report contrasted with how he handled the State Department’s annual human rights report in March. He declined to unveil it in person, breaking with precedent, and drew criticism he was not giving rights issues adequate attention.

The report did not address Trump’s attempt this year to temporarily suspend refugee admissions and his decision to impose a lower cap on the number of those admissions. The report states that resettlement is a “vital tool for providing refugees protection.” Many refugees admitted to the United States in 2016 were fleeing religious intolerance and persecution, it said.

Top US general reaffirms commitment to Japan amid North Korea tensions,"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Source: AP Photo/File) US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Source: AP Photo/File)

The top US general restated Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to the security of its close Asian ally, Japan, on Friday amid regional tensions over North Korea, telling his counterpart in Tokyo that “an attack on one is an attack on both of us”. Fears about North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes have grown in recent weeks. Pyongyang has said it was considering plans to fire missiles over Japan towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, although North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears to have delayed the decision.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and their Japanese counterparts agreed at a meeting in Washington on Thursday to work more closely on North Korea. “The most important thing it (the ministers’ meeting) did was reaffirm the primacy of our bilateral relationship here in Asia-Pacific,” US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford said at the start of a meeting with the Chief of Staff of Japan’s Self-Defence Forces, Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano.

“This is a very important time for security in the region and of course we are mostly focused on the threat coming out of North Korea,” Dunford said. “I think we have made it clear to North Korea and anyone else in the region that an attack on one is an attack on both of us.”

Tillerson said in Washington the United States wanted dialogue with Pyongyang, but only if it were meaningful.

“Our effort is to cause them to want to engage in talks but engage in talks with an understanding that these talks will lead to a different conclusion than talks of the past,” he said.

In 2005, North Korea reached an agreement with six countries to suspend its nuclear programme in return for diplomatic rewards and energy assistance but the deal later collapsed.

Tensions have risen after North Korea conducted two missile tests in July which, like its five atomic bomb tests, were carried out in defiance of international pressure and United Nations resolutions. US President Donald Trump has vowed not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the US mainland but Pyongyang sees its nuclear arsenal as protection against Washington and its partners in Asia.

The new US Ambassador to Japan, William Hagerty, said he had arrived at a difficult time and the United States wanted to work with Japan to “calm the rhetoric” over North Korea. “Our alliance is rock solid, in fact in my personal view this is the greatest alliance on earth,” he said as he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.

“FIRE AND FURY”

Dunford said on Thursday the United States and South Korea would go ahead with joint military drills next week despite pressure from North Korea and its main ally, China, to halt the contentious exercises that Pyongyang routinely describes as preparation for war. North Korea has fired missiles and taken other steps in response to the war games in the past.

Trump warned North Korea last week it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States, prompting North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards Guam. Both sides have since tempered their rhetoric somewhat, but with North Korea’s military capabilities growing, Japan has been looking to strengthen its defences.

The Japanese defence ministry wants to introduce a land-based missile defence system called “Aegis Ashore” to address North Korea’s missile threats and has decided to seek funding in the next fiscal year to cover the system design costs, a Japanese defence official told Reuters. “We will absolutely help and what’s most important for ballistic missile defence is that we integrate our capabilities,” Dunford said.

Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in Washington Japan would strengthen its defence posture in response to the North Korean threat and provide $500 million to help boost maritime security in East Asia, where China has been pursuing extensive maritime claims that have angered regional neighbours.

Japan is likely to increase its defence spending at a faster pace in its next five-year plan from April 2019 than the annual 0.8 percent average rise in its current mid-term plan, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday. Defence officials have said such a rise was desirable but finance ministry officials are cautious because of Tokyo’s mammoth public debt.

North Korea has repeatedly threatened to target Japan, which hosts around 54,000 US military personnel, as well as South Korea and the United States with its missiles.

The United Nations approved tough new sanctions against North Korea earlier this month in response to its missile tests, which include a ban on North Korean seafood exports. China, North Korea’s largest trading partner, has vowed to enforce the new sanctions, as it has done with previous imposts, and says it is ready to pay the price.

State-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times said on its website late on Thursday that authorities in the Chinese border city of Hunchun were negotiating with North Korea about the fate of seafood trucks stuck between the two countries’ customs ports. “The seafood that can’t enter China is ready to be gradually shipped back to North Korea,” a Hunchun official told the paper.

Schools work to make students’ bags lighter,"A year after the state issued a circular asking schools to monitor and regulate the weight of students’ bags, some city institutes have chalked out detailed plans to follow the directive.

Euroschool International in Airoli has implemented a formal programme that involves random checks of schoolbags by students appointed as ‘safety marshals’. These marshals also counsel other students on ways to make the bags lighter. The school claims that the programme, along with measures such as an altered timetable, locker facilities and switch to e-learning, has been successful in reducing the load for students between six and 10 years of age by at least 1 kg.

Raymond Fernandez, head, content and learning, Euroschool, said, “Under our structured programme, we monitor the weight of schoolbags and collect the data to study the average weight a child carries over a period of time, to understand how to reduce the load.”

At St Joseph’s School, Panvel, the new time table mandates fewer textbooks and notebooks. Kalpana Diwvedi, the principal, said, “We have reduced the number of textbooks and notebooks to a maximum of four for the entire curriculum. However, parents must also be proactive and make sure their children do not carry extra weight. For example, fancy bottles and two tiffin boxes can be avoided.”

At some schools, a good cafeteria has turned out to be the solution to the multiple-tiffin problem. Deepshikha Srivastava, principal of Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri West, said, “We offer lunches in the cafeteria, and tell children to carry their own water bottles. In addition, we have provided a notice to students and parents as to how to maintain a healthy bag weight.” Parents, however, claim that the measures are limited to a few schools.

Arundhati Chavan, the head of the Parent Teacher Association United Forum of Maharashtra, said, “At present, less than 10 per cent of the schools have implemented the government’s recommendations. Only those with fewer students, such as IB schools, have been able to do it.”

Chavan added that parents too need to take responsibility and steer away from the mindset where carrying all books is considered the norm.

Coastal Road project: BMC locks horns with Maritime Board over new recommendations,"THe Coastal Road project has encountered a fresh hurdle, with the Maharashtra Maritime Board, which had given its nod to the project last year, recently making new recommendations. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has refused to implement the suggestions.

The BMC had applied for the MMB’s clearance to the Coastal Road Project in 2015. On May 1 last year, the authority gave a letter saying it had no objection to the alignment of the proposed road. However, the letter also said the alignment could be improved upon and that it should be done in consultation with the MMB. More than a year later, the MMB sent another letter to the BMC on June 15, making several points, including a mandatory construction of breakwater for the proposed jetty to transport materials for the project.

The Board also highlighted the possibility of accidents and recommended that a trauma care hospital as well as search and rescue management system be set up near the jetties. With reference to the latest alignment, in which the Coastal Road has been divided into southern and northern halves, the BMC has proposed two temporary jetties, at Priyadarshini Park and at Worli.

After a month, the MMB sent a second letter on July 15, repeating the suggestions and asking the BMC for an action-taken update.

The BMC sent a reply to the MMB on August 16, saying the suggestions couldn’t be adopted.

“They first said they had no objection with the alignment and then more than a year later, they have come up with new suggestions. We have pointed out these discrepancies to them. We have already secured permissions from all other departments, including the Environment Ministry and the revenue department, and we cannot use additional funds to accommodate the new suggestions,” said an official from the Coastal Road department of the BMC.

On the suggestion of constructing a breakwater, which involves dumping tetrapods to break the flow of the tide at the jetties, the official said the jetties are only temporary. “The project includes a sea protection wall and we don’t need breakwater for the jetties since we are just using them to transport material for construction,” said the official.

Defending the MMB’s stand, Atul Patne, its chief executive officer, said, “We had given an in-principle nod for the project last year. However, the alignment of the Coastal Road has since been changed several times and the BMC will need NOCs separately for them.” He added that the BMC would need nods for any development on reclaimed land, since that falls under the jurisdiction of the Maritime Board.

Under the Coastal Road project, around 90 hectares of land will be reclaimed for its southern phase and 40 hectares for the northern phase. Of the 29.20-km long bridge, the south phase will run from the Princess Street flyover till the south end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link while the north phase will cover the stretch from the north end of the Sea Link till Kandivli.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in says North Korean nuclear-tipped ICBM is a “red line”,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in. (Source: Reuters Photo) South Korean President Moon Jae-in. (Source: Reuters Photo)

North Korea would be “crossing a red line” if it put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile, South Korea’s president said on Thursday, but the United States had promised to seek Seoul’s approval before taking any military action. North Korea’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fuelled a surge in tensions in recent days. Pyongyang has threatened to fire missiles towards the Pacific island of Guam and U.S. President Donald Trump has warned it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States.

“I would consider that North Korea is crossing a red line if it launches an intercontinental ballistic missile again and weaponises it by putting a nuclear warhead on top of the missile,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at a news conference marking his first 100 days in office. Moon has repeatedly urged North Korea not to “cross the red line” but had not previously elaborated what that would constitute. Trump had promised to seek negotiations and approval from South Korea before taking any options regarding North Korea, Moon also said. The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

Washington has warned it is ready to use force if needed to stop North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes but that it prefers global diplomatic action.

“NO MILITARY SOLUTION”

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in Chile on Wednesday that “all options” remained on the table with regards to North Korea, and he called on Latin American nations to break ties with Pyongyang.

However, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said there was “no military solution” to North Korea’s nuclear threats because of Pyongyang’s massed artillery targeting the South Korean capital.

“Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us,” Bannon told The American Prospect.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has repeatedly urged Pyongyang to halt its weapons programme and at the same time urged South Korea and the United States to stop military drills in order to lower tensions.

Bannon said he was pushing the U.S. administration to take a harder line on China trade and not put complaints against its trade practices in the backseat in the hope that Beijing would help restrain leader Kim Jong Un.

“To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,” The American Prospect quoted Bannon as saying. North Korean media reported on Tuesday that Kim had delayed the decision on firing four missiles towards Guam, a U.S. territory home to a vital air base and Navy facility, while he waited to see what the United States did next.

“Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!”

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field — who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US — is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

“Knowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,” Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

“The problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,” he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in “The Best American Short Stories” and “O. Henry Prize Collections”. Sharma’s first book, “An Obedient Father”, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, “Family Life” won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. “I began writing ‘We Didn’t Like Him’ the day after I handed in my novel ‘Family Life’. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

“I then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn’t satisfy me and so I wrote another,” the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story — from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

“We Didn’t Like Him”, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled “A Life of Adventure and Delight” (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. “They are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,” he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. “They cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,” he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

Chandrababu Naidu for interlinking of rivers to prevent water disputes,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu (File Photo) Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu (File Photo)

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday stressed on the need for interlinking of rivers in the country to prevent inter-state disputes over water. Noting that water was an issue of national concern, he said interlinking of rivers will help in better management of resources.

The chief minister was speaking at his camp office in Amaravati with members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources, who were on a tour of the state. “Water is an issue of national concern. All rivers in the north and the south need to be connected. Water disputes between states can be prevented and the resources managed in a sustainable way,” a release from his office quoted the CM as telling the visiting delegation.

Naidu briefed the committee on the progress of construction works on Polavaram, declared as a national project by the Centre under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. The meeting also discussed the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM), Command Area Development and Water Management (CAD&WM), rain water harvesting programme and the packaged drinking water industry and its effect in AP, the release said.

Committee Chairman Hukum Singh, members Siddhant Mohapatra, Apurupa Poddar, V Sathyabama, Ananda Bhaskar Rapolu, Pradeep Tamta, Balwinder Singh Bhunder, A V Singh and Harshvardhan Singh Dungarpur attended the meeting.

Officials from the Union Water Resources Ministry, the Central Water Commission and the state government also attended. The panel will visit the Thotapalli reservoir in Vizianagaram tomorrow and inspect the works, the release added.

China: Former head of Chinese news agency investigated for suspected graft,"The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.

The retired former head of an important state-run Chinese news agency has been put under investigation for suspected graft, the ruling Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog said on Wednesday. Liu Beixian, editor-in-chief of the China News Service until retiring in February 2015, was suspected of “serious discipline breaches”, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a statement. It provided no other details and it was not possible to reach Liu or a legal or family representative for comment.

The China News Service is run under the auspices of the Chinese cabinet’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and is designed to serve as a news source for Chinese communities in places like Hong Kong and self-ruled Taiwan. It is separate from Xinhua, China’s national official news agency.

Liu began working at the China News Service in 1983 and was its Hong Kong bureau chief from 1997 to 2000, according to his official resume, a period that coincided with the handover of the former British territory back to Chinese rule.

President Xi Jinping has mounted a sweeping campaign against deep-rooted corruption since taking office almost five years ago, jailing or meting out lesser punishments to hundreds of thousands of officials.

Delhi girl murder: Her parents knew about boy’s temper,"Shreya’s family at the crematorium. Express photo by Amit Mehra Shreya’s family at the crematorium. Express photo by Amit Mehra

“They are burning my daughter. Someone should stop them. Nothing will be left of her but smoke and ash,” cried Lalita Sharma, as her daughter’s last rites were being conducted in the crematorium on Thursday. She refused to leave, and relatives had to carry her towards a car that took her home.

On Thursday morning, her daughter, Shreya, a Class XII student, was found dead in a narrow lane near her house. She had been strangled by her former senior from school.

Shreya’s parents alleged that the accused, Sarthak Kapoor, didn’t leave their daughter alone. “He would get angry if my daughter spoke to other boys and would issue threats. We complained against Sarthak after which he was rusticated from school,” her father, Yogesh Sharma, said. Schoolgirl strangled in Delhi by 19-year-old who ‘objected to her talking to other boys’.

Shreya’s relatives said she was an intelligent girl. They hoped she would repeat her near perfect score of 10 cumulative grade point average (CGPA), which she scored in the Class X board exams, in Class XII too. “My daughter did not even have time to go out of the house. She would study the entire day. When she did manage to find some time, she would participate in extra-curricular activities. She used to participate in Olympiad and Asiad competitions and won quite a few. She had recently won a competition organised by NASA,” her father said.

Her younger brother, Karthik (10), said, “I had a lot of difficulty understanding maths problems. She would sit with me and help out with my homework.”

Mobile videos may help parents stick to infants’ sleep practices,"The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed.

A mobile programme of informational videos and messages may improve parents’ adherence to safe sleep practices for infants, new research has found. The researchers tested two different types of educational interventions. The first involved nurses teaching new parents about safe sleep practices for infants while still in the hospital. The the second intervention the mobile programme involved delivering information through e-mails, messages and videos.

Following recommended safe sleep practices can reduce the risk of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed; avoiding soft bedding that could strangle or suffocate infants; and using pacifiers, which has been shown to reduce SIDS risk.

“We’d been looking at the prevalence of safe sleep practices for a long time, and I had been getting really energised about doing a study that takes what we know about safe sleep prevalence and tests an intervention that might help improve the adherence to the ‘gold standard’ safe sleep practices,” said Eve Colson, Professor at Yale School of Medicine, Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US.

According to the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, mobile videos for educating new parents on safe infant sleep practices achieved rates of 92.5 per cent for back sleeping and 85.9 per cent for room-sharing without bed-sharing, two of the critical steps towards SUID reduction. These rates were much higher than those for the group who received only the in-hospital intervention on safe sleep practices.

In a clinical trial with 1,263 families, “mothers who received a mobile health intervention with regular text or email messages and videos reported statistically significantly higher rates of placing their infants supine to sleep compared with mothers who received control interventions”, the study said.

Rajya Sabha polls: BJP candidate Balvantsinh Rajput challenges EC order in HC,"Rajput’s petition claimed that once the Returning Officer had used his discretion to accept the two votes as valid, the EC had “no power to issue any direction to the Returning Officer for accepting or rejecting any vote”. Rajput’s petition claimed that once the Returning Officer had used his discretion to accept the two votes as valid, the EC had “no power to issue any direction to the Returning Officer for accepting or rejecting any vote”.

Balvantsinh Rajput, the BJP candidate who lost the Rajya Sabha election from Gujarat recently, today moved the Gujarat High Court against the Election Commission’s decision to invalidate the votes of two rebel Congress MLAs. Rajput, who quit the Congress ahead of the August 8 election, also contended that votes of two other Congress MLAs should be discounted, and he should be declared winner. The EC’s decision paved the way for the victory of Congress candidate Ahmed Patel — who got 44 votes, the minimum he needed to win — in the high-stakes electoral battle. Rajput polled 38 votes.

Rajput’s petition claimed that once the Returning Officer had used his discretion to accept the two votes as valid, the EC had “no power to issue any direction to the Returning Officer for accepting or rejecting any vote”. As Chief Justice R Subhash Reddy was on leave today, the petition came up before the senior-most judge, Justice M R Shah, who ordered that it be listed for hearing on August 21 before the appropriate bench. The EC had rejected the votes of former Congress MLAs Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohel.

Congress’s polling agent Shaktisinh Gohil had lodged a complaint before the counting began that these two MLAs showed their ballots to BJP representatives before putting them in the ballot box. MLAs are not allowed to show their ballots to anybody other than the authorised polling agent of their own party, the Congress leader said.

Both these MLAs voted for Rajput instead of voting for Ahmed Patel. However, as the votes were held invalid, Patel was declared winner (along with BJP’s Amit Shah and Union minister Smriti Irani). Had Patel got less than 44 votes, Rajput could have won with second preference votes from the BJP. Rajput’s petition said that EC’s order should be set aside, as it was “patently illegal”.

Once the Returning Officer had exercised his discretion of accepting these two votes as valid, the EC had no power to hear any appeal against the order. The only remedy the aggrieved party had was to move a court, it said. Rajput also alleged that Patel won because of “corrupt” practices”.

Two other MLAs of Congress had also shown their ballots to unauthorised persons, and these two votes, which went to Patel, must be held invalid, the petition said. If these two votes were rejected, Rajput would get more votes, and hence he should be declared as elected to Rajya Sabha in place of Patel, the petition said

China regains spot as largest foreign US creditor,"Representational Image Representational Image

China purchased the most Treasuries in six years in June, vaulting past Japan as the largest overseas lender to the US government, possibly taking advantage of recent weakness in the dollar in a rising US interest rate environment. Tuesday’s report from the US Treasury Department also signaled that China has steadily ratcheted up its accumulation of US government debt as it has burned far less of its foreign exchange reserves this year to defend the yuan currency.

In 2016, China spent nearly $320 billion of foreign exchange reserves in an effort to stem the yuan’s depreciation against the US dollar. In the wake of tighter capital controls and a weaker dollar so far this year, China’s forex reserves, the world’s biggest, have grown in line with its Treasuries holdings.

In June, China’s Treasuries holdings rose to $1.147 trillion, which was the highest level since September when it was $1.157 trillion. And in July, China’s currency reserves reached a nine-month peak at $3.081 trillion. “They may have reshuffled their portfolio a little bit and sold a few things. Maybe they think the dollar is attractive now and they increased those (Treasuries) holdings,” said Kevin Lai, chief economist Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.

The overall increase in reserves was due to weakness in the dollar, which has helped push up the value of non-dollar currencies in its holdings, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said last week. Indeed, the People’s Bank of China remains a net seller of foreign currency, though net sales narrowed sharply to 4.647 billion yuan ($694.93 million) in July, according to central bank data on Wednesday.

The recent increase in Treasury holdings possibly also reflects an incentive to by US-dollar denominated assets amid rising US interest rates. The pullback in the dollar over recent months allowed for a relatively cheaper entry point. Before China returned to being the largest US overseas lender, Japan had held that spot for eight months. Japan held $1.091 trillion in US government debt in June, down from $1.111 trillion in May.

Japan’s drop in Treasuries holdings was the steepest since November, falling to a level last seen in December. Ireland was a distant third in holdings of Treasuries, with $302.5 billion in June, up from $295.8 billion in May.

Overall, foreign investors bought $19.73 billion in Treasuries in June, down from $46.37 billion in May, which was the most since June 2015. While there was speculation in recent years that China would use its massive Treasuries holdings to exert pressure on the United States, there has been little indication of that happening, even amid rising tensions between the two countries on issues ranging from trade to North Korea.

“The PBOC’s primary motivation is to manage the fx reserves in a way that makes sure they are held in safe and liquid investments and that they make a decent rate of return”, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “I don’t think the primary motivations are going to be political.”

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

Turkey asks Germany to arrest and extradite top suspect in coup,"Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu (L) said that Turkey submitted a formal note demanding fugitive Adil Oksuz’s extradition. (AP photo) Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu (L) said that Turkey submitted a formal note demanding fugitive Adil Oksuz’s extradition. (AP photo)

Turkey formally asked the German government on Wednesday to arrest and extradite a top suspect in last year’s failed coup attempt following reports suggesting that he has been spotted in Germany. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey submitted a formal note demanding fugitive Adil Oksuz’s extradition.

Oksuz, accused of being a follower of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, is believed to have played a key part in the failed coup. Gulen denies accusations of involvement in the attempt. “If this person is there, we asked that he be located, taken into custody and returned to Turkey,” Cavusoglu said.

German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer confirmed that the request had been received and would be reviewed “on the basis of the law,” but said it wasn’t clear whether Oksuz was actually in Germany. Schaefer told reporters that Germany was aware of the allegations against Oksuz, but that authorities would “stick to what concrete, credible and verifiable information” is provided to them.

The request comes amid souring relations between the two countries. Turkey accuses Germany of providing a safe haven to Kurdish militants and suspects wanted for alleged links to the coup. Germany has protested the arrest of several of its citizens in Turkey since the coup, including two journalists and a human rights activist. Schaefer said Germany’s ambassador

Schaefer said Germany’s ambassador in Turkey is scheduled to meet Tuesday with German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who was detained in February on suspicion of aiding forbidden groups.

Ambassador Martin Erdmann planned to visit German human rights campaigner Peter Steudtner on Wednesday, Schaefer said. Steudtner and Ali Gharavi of Sweden were arrested July 5 during a raid on a Turkish hotel where they were teaching a digital security workshop.

They were among six activists, including Amnesty International’s Turkey director Idil Eser, detained last month for allegedly aiding an unspecified armed terror group.

US designates two top ISIS leaders as ‘global terrorists’,"Representational image. Representational image.

The US today designated two top Islamic State leaders, one of whom involved in the deadly 2015 Paris and 2016 Brussels attacks, as ‘global terrorists’ as they pose a significant risk to America. Ahmad Alkhald, a Syrian national, is an ISIS bomb-maker responsible for the deaths of numerous civilians in Europe. Abu Yahya al-Iraqi, also known as Iyad Hamed Mahl al-Jumaily, is a senior ISIS figure who reports to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

These designations seek to deny Alkhald and Al-Iraqi the resources they need to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks, the State Department said. Among other consequences, all of Alkhald’s and Al-Iraqi’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and Americans are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them.

The State Department said Alkhald is the explosives chief of the terrorist cell that carried out the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the March 2016 attacks in Brussels. Alkhald travelled to Europe where he helped plan the Paris attacks and manufacture the explosive belts used in that plot, which killed and injured hundreds of people, including a number of Americans.

Following his return to Syria shortly before the attacks in Paris, Alkhald continued to guide ISIS operatives in Europe on making the bombs used in the March 2016 Brussels attacks. Alkhald is wanted internationally and a European warrant for his arrest has been issued.

On the other hand, Al-Iraqi has reportedly played a key role in security for Al-Baghdadi and oversees ISIS security in Iraq and Syria, the State Department said. The US has so far designated over 30 ISIS leaders and operatives.

“These designations are part of a larger comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS that, in coordination with the 73-member Global Coalition, has made significant progress towards that goal.

“This whole-of-government effort is destroying ISIS in its safe havens, denying its ability to recruit foreign terrorist fighters, stifling its financial resources, negating the false propaganda it disseminates over the internet and social media and helping to stabilise liberated areas in Iraq and Syria so the displaced can return to their homes and begin to rebuild their lives,” said the State Department.

Justice for Hadiya,"That this order comes in a case where the Kerala High Court has questioned a 24-year-old adult woman’s autonomy and freedom to choose the course of her life is doubly disquieting. That this order comes in a case where the Kerala High Court has questioned a 24-year-old adult woman’s autonomy and freedom to choose the course of her life is doubly disquieting.

The Supreme Court has ordered an investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into a possible “conspiracy” which involves Hindu women in Kerala being converted to Islam. That an anti-terrorism investigative agency has been tasked with ascertaining the veracity of religious conversions is problematic enough. That this order comes in a case where the Kerala High Court has questioned a 24-year-old adult woman’s autonomy and freedom to choose the course of her life is doubly disquieting.

In May this year, the Kerala High Court annulled the marriage between Shafi Jehan and Hadiya, who was known as Akhila before she chose to convert to Islam. In doing so, it argued that a woman’s “marriage being the most important decision in her life, [it] can also be taken only with the active involvement of her parents” — a judgement that enforces the widespread patriarchal understanding of women being the forever wards and property of their parents.

Hadiya’s father had argued that his daughter had come under the influence of radical Islamists, while she has told the court that she converted to Islam of her own volition. More disturbingly, while declaring the marriage as a “sham”, the high court suggested that Jehan had links with the Islamic State extremists on the basis of the WhatsApp groups he had been a part of — a police investigation had not found any criminal element in Hadiya’s conversion or marriage.

When Jehan moved the SC, he was asking it to adjudicate on the wisdom of the HC judgment. The court, instead, chose to bring in the NIA to probe whether there is a larger, dubious pattern in conversions of Hindu women to Islam. Why was it moved to do so remains unclear, and invites suspicions of judicial overreach. And what of Hadiya? Has she had a chance to argue her case? Since the May order of the high court, she has been under house arrest in her parents’ home, forbidden to meet her husband or anyone else. Neither has the SC intervened to free her of this illegal incarceration, nor has it bothered to listened to her account of the case.

There have been countless cases in this country’s history when the courts have stood up for the freedom of the individual against the diktat of the community, family or state. By choosing to prioritise shadowy fears of “love jihad” over a flesh-and-blood individual’s rights, the court has gone against its own grain. It runs the risk of feeding into a communal narrative, which is growing in strength.

It has set a dangerous precedent that can surely be used to curb the agency and autonomy of Indian women. The Kerala HC, in its order, had said that “we are not satisfied that it is safe to let Akhila [be] free to decide what she wants in her life.” The Supreme Court must reinstate the freedom of this Indian citizen.

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange to begin trading this month,"“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil. “We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

* Exchange will allow trade in Egyptian pounds * Bitcoin value has surged in recent months * Egypt has not yet regulated digital currency

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange will go live later this month, the founders of Bitcoin Egypt said, linking the Middle East’s most populous country with a cryptocurrency that has surged in value in recent months.

Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, a volatile digital currency that has captured the interest of speculative investors worldwide as its value has soared, roughly quadrupling since the start of 2017 and trading at around $4,400 on Thursday.

Egypt, most of whose 93 million people have no bank accounts but where electronic payments have grown in recent years, lacks regulations for digital currency. This means local retailers cannot accept it as payment but users on an exchange may be left to trade freely, potentially cashing in on its ascent.

“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

He said the exchange has picked up about 300 pre-registrations from users ahead of its launch.

The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, the country’s financial markets regulator, did not respond to requests for comment. Khalil and co-founder Omar Abdelrasoul see their platform connecting a community of several thousand bitcoin enthusiasts who will for the first time be able to trade in Egyptian pounds, which have roughly halved in value since November after flotation under an International Monetary Fund loan programme.

“Cryptoassets are happening whether (the Egyptian government) joins in or not. And by not joining they’re missing out on a very big market. Currently bitcoin is about a $70 billion market,” said Khalil.

Cryptocurrencies allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks.

Bitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls. This has helped it proliferate in China, the world’s most active bitcoin market, but has led some governments to crack down on its use to prevent money laundering.

Those same dynamics could propel bitcoin in Egypt, where a shortage of hard currency after the 2011 uprising sharply restricted bank transfers. Though liquidity at banks has improved and capital controls have been lifted in recent months, businesses still resort to a black market for dollars to obtain currency not available in the formal banking system.

“We’re trying to get people used to the idea of bitcoin, to ready the market so that in a couple of years we will reach a greater number of users. But for now we are trying to let people know what cryptocurrency is,” said Abdelrasoul.

A van crashed into dozens of people in the centre of Barcelona on Thursday and Spanish media said at least two people were killed. Police said several people were injured and described the incident on Twitter as a “massive crash”. A police spokesman said he could not confirm any deaths or that the incident was being treated as terrorism. Soon afterwards, Spain’s El Periodico newspaper reported that two armed men were holed up in a bar in Barcelona’s city centre, and reported gunfire in the area, although it did not cite the source of the information.

It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were connected. Following the van crash, emergency services said people should not go to the area around Barcelona’s Placa Catalunya, one of the city’s main squares at the top of the famous Las Ramblas avenue, and requested the closure of nearby train and metro stations.

El Pais newspaper said the driver of the vehicle had fled on foot after mowing down dozens of people. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured. The incident took place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe’s top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.

While full details of the van incident were not immediately clear, vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe since July 2016, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm. Witness Ethan Spibey told Britain’s Sky News: “All of sudden it was real chaos. People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.”

He said he had taken refuge with dozens of other people in a nearby church. “They’ve locked the doors because I’m not sure whether the person who may have done it has actually been caught, so they’ve locked the doors and told people just to wait in here.” In recent weeks, threatening graffiti against tourists has appeared in Barcelona. In one video released under the slogan “tourism kills neighbourhoods”, several hooded individuals stopped a tourist bus in Barcelona, slashed the tyres and spray-painted the windscreen.

The deadliest recent attack in Spain was in March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

"AIIMS 2017 paper leak: CBI registers case, Delhi High Court directs Centre and AIIMS to file replies","Whistleblower Dr Anand Rai alleged that the AIIMS MBBS UG paper was leaked Whistleblower Dr Anand Rai alleged that the AIIMS MBBS UG paper was leaked

The CBI on August 16 told the Delhi High Court that it has registered a case on the alleged leak of question paper for the AIIMS MBBS entrance examination held this year, from an institute in Ghaziabad. The submission was made before a before a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, which was hearing a PIL seeking a court-monitored probe into the alleged illegalities and irregularities during the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) MBBS entrance exam held on May 28 this year.

The agency, in its reply, said that “specific questions in the leaked screen shots were used in SET-3 of shift-2 at exam centre — HR Institute of Technology, Morta, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh”.

“It has also been found that the specific combination and sequence of the questions was randomly and uniquely allocated to a particular candidate,” the affidavit, filed through CBI Special Public Prosecutor Rajdipa Behura, said.

It also said that searches were conducted at the house of a student, the exam centre and its officials. During the course of the investigation, documents and digital evidence were seized, it added. “A regular case was registered on June 13,” the agency said, adding that the “investigation of the case is at the initial stage, five witnesses have been examined and eight documents have been seized so far”.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on September 13 by when the Centre and AIIMS have to file their replies. The CBI was responding to the plea of doctor Anand Rai, who claims to be a whistleblower in the Vyapam scam case, seeking directions to AIIMS to quash the result declared on June 15 for the MBBS exam held on May 28.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, has submitted that the results be only quashed if the probe “reveals that the entrance examination has been entirely and irreversibly vitiated.”

The petition sought direction to AIIMS to produce before the court the finding of the institute’s committee which was constituted for conducting inquiry into the complaints regarding the conduct of the examination.

Rai had on May 31 alleged that the question papers of this year’s entrance exam for MBBS course of the AIIMS were leaked.

He had, in a series of tweets, posted images of question papers of the entrance examination which was held across the country on May 28 and said he had received the snapshots from a source who claimed these were leaked from a college in Lucknow when the online test was going on. Rai had also alleged that AIIMS MBBS seats were being “sold”.

US and China have to work through ‘difficult issues’: Top US military officer,"Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford reviews a Chinese honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Bayi Building in Beijing, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo) Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford reviews a Chinese honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Bayi Building in Beijing, Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017. (AP Photo)

The top U.S. military officer told his Chinese counterpart Tuesday that the U.S. and China have “many difficult issues” to work through, during a visit that comes amid tensions over North Korea’s missile program, Taiwan and China’s claims in the South China Sea. Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the remarks at the opening of a meeting with Fang Fenghui, chief of the People’s Liberation Army’s joint staff department.

U.S. officials say Dunford’s visit aims to create a mechanism for improving communication between the sides, especially on sensitive issues such as North Korea. Dunford and Fang signed an agreement committing the sides to that goal, with the details to be discussed during talks in Washington in November. Fang said Dunford’s visit was a key part of efforts to expand dialogue between the U.S. and China as agreed by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, when they met earlier this year.

To that end, China has arranged a series of important meetings and visits to help Dunford “know more about our military, (boost) our cooperation and build up our friendship,” Fang said.

Dunford responded that the U.S. considered the meetings important to making progress on areas of disagreement, without citing any specific examples.

“I think here, we have to be honest – we have many, many difficult issues where we don’t necessarily share the same perspective,” Dunford said. “I know we share one thing: We share a commitment to work through these difficult issues,” he added, saying that with the guidance of political leaders “we are going to make some progress over the next few days.” This is the highest-level meeting between the two countries’ militaries since Trump and Xi met in Florida in April.

The U.S. delegation will be flying to the northeastern city of Shenyang on Wednesday to observe an exercise staged by the People’s Liberation Army’s Northern Theater Command. Fang cited the event as being among the measures aimed at building mutual trust and understanding.

While the sides agreed several years ago to establish a hotline between the Pentagon and China’s defense ministry, that mechanism has never gone into operation. U.S. officials say they’ve attempted to use it, but that the Chinese side has never answered their requests.

The Chinese and U.S. militaries have joined in naval exercises off the coast of Hawaii and other limited multinational drills mainly aimed at dealing with humanitarian disasters. They’ve also tried to improve mutual trust through agreements on dealing with unexpected encounters at sea.

Despite those, China deeply resents the presence of the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.

Last week, China expressed its “strong dissatisfaction” with the U.S. over the Navy’s latest freedom of navigation operation in which a warship sailed past one of China’s man-made islands.

Dunford is visiting South Korea, Japan and China after a week in which Trump said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the U.S. In a phone call with Trump on Saturday, Chinese President Xi said all sides should avoid rhetoric or action that would worsen tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

"‘Elite’ Jese Rodriguez can flourish at Stoke City, says Mark Hughes","Jese Rodriguez was Stoke City’s sixth recruit in the current transfer window and Mark Hughes says his team are stronger than last season. (Source: AP) Jese Rodriguez was Stoke City’s sixth recruit in the current transfer window and Mark Hughes says his team are stronger than last season. (Source: AP)

Manager Mark Hughes believes Stoke City have secured an elite player in forward Jese Rodriguez, who joined the team on a season-long loan from Paris St Germain on Wednesday, and says the 24-year-old can excel at the Premier League club.

Former Real Madrid player Rodriguez won multiple titles with the Spanish club before sustaining a serious knee injury in 2014. He failed to re-establish himself after the long injury layoff and joined PSG in 2016.

After an underwhelming start to last season, Rodriguez spent the second half on loan at Spain’s Las Palmas. “I think we can give him a platform here to really enjoy himself. Everyone is excited to see him play,” Hughes told reporters on Friday.

“He’s an elite player, a top-level player and you don’t get too many opportunities to bring players like him to the club. When you do you should enjoy it.”

Rodriguez was Stoke’s sixth recruit in the current transfer window and Hughes says his team are stronger than last season. “It’s always the case in transfer windows that you want to be stronger at the end than the start” Hughes said.

“If you look at the players we let go I would argue that we’ve only let go of one who would be a regular starter, the rest would be squad players.

“But we’ve replaced them with starters. If you compare and contrast with last season I believe we are much stronger.” Hughes also confirmed that forward Julien NGoy has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a thigh injury.

Four business leaders have resigned this week from U.S. President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council to protest the president’s tepid comments to weekend violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka became the latest to resign on Tuesday after Trump blamed both sides for the violence that left one woman dead and several others injured. Merck & Co Inc’s Kenneth Frazier, who is African-American, was the first CEO to leave one of Trump’s presidential advisory councils and was followed by the chief executives of Intel Corp and Under Armour Inc.

Trump on Monday denounced white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, as “criminals and thugs,” bowing to days of mounting political pressure to condemn such groups explicitly. However, on Tuesday he reverted to his earlier comments blaming “many sides” for the violence. The following are responses from companies and CEOs on Trump’s manufacturing council to the violence in Virginia:

* Dow Chemical Co: “I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia,” Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement.

Dell Inc: “There’s no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees,” a Dell Inc spokeswoman said in a statement. CEO Michael Dell plans to remain on the manufacturing council.

* General Electric Co: Jeff Immelt will remain on the council while he is the chairman of the company. “GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,” a company spokesperson said.

* Intel Corp: “There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries leadership to do the same,” CEO Brian Krzanich said in a tweet. He later said in a blog post on Intel website that he was exiting the council “to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues.”

* Under Armour Inc: “We are saddened by #Charlottesville. There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity,” CEO Kevin Plank, who also left the council, said in a tweet from the company’s Twitter account.

* Whirlpool Corp: Whirlpool will stay on the council. “Whirlpool Corp believes strongly in an open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds. Our company has long fostered an environment of acceptance and tolerance in the workplace,” a company spokeswoman said.

* Campbell Soup Co: Chief Executive Denise Morrison will remain on the council. “The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our society. Not simply because of the violence, but because the racist ideology at the center of the protests is wrong and must be condemned in no uncertain terms,” a company spokesman said in a statement.

* American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO): AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka will resign from President Trump’s Council on Manufacturing, effective immediately. “I cannot sit on a council for a president that tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Trumka said.

* Wal-Mart Stores Inc: “Representing a company with the largest and one of the most diverse groups of associates in the U.S., and an even more diverse customer base of tens of millions of customers, we believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together,” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said.

* Johnson & Johnson: “In the end, I have concluded that Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to remain engaged, not as a way to support any specific political agenda, but as a way to represent the values of Our Credo as crucial public policy is discussed and developed,” Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.

* International Paper Co: “International Paper strongly condemns the violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend – there is no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in our society,” a company spokesman said in a statement.

* Boeing Co: Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will stay on the manufacturing council.

* U.S. Steel Corp: A spokesperson referred queries related to the American Manufacturing Council back to the White House.

Libyan army commander arrest sought by ICC for alleged executions and war crimes,"Judges at the ICC on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a LNA commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. (File Photo) Judges at the ICC on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a LNA commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. (File Photo)

Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for a Libyan National Army (LNA)commander accused over the alleged execution of dozens of prisoners. Prosecutors at the world’s permanent war crimes court are seeking Mahmoud al-Werfalli’s hand-over to face charges of murder during the armed conflict in Libya.

According to the ICC, Werfalli “is alleged to have directly committed and to have ordered the commission of murder as a war crime” during seven incidents, involving 33 persons in June and July 2017 in and near Benghazi. The LNA, which controls the eastern part of Libya, has been pushing to expand its presence in the central and southern part of the country where it has been vying for control with forces linked to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and other groups.

The United Nations called for the LNA to suspend Werfalli after a video in March allegedly showed Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs. The LNA said it would investigate any potential war crimes but has not released any details of such a probe.

In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.

The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes in Libya after a referral by the United Nations Security Council in 2011 and has been investigating alleged atrocities there.

"Scanty rains in Vidarbha affects orange production, fruit set to be costlier","Nagpur oranges have a cult following across the country. Nagpur oranges have a cult following across the country.

Nagpur oranges are all set to pinch the consumer hard as traders and growers complain of less crop due to absence of rain in Vidarbha. Estimates say this year the arrival of oranges will be hit by more than 60 per cent, which will have an effect on its prices.

On an average, Maharashtra reports around 1,24,000 hectares of orange orchards with the state cornering 9 per cent of the country’s production.

Nagpur oranges start arriving in the market by September-end and continue to feed the market for the next three-four months. During the peak season, the wholesale market of Pune sees the arrival of 150-200 tonnes of the fruit daily. Nagpur oranges have a cult following across the country and is awaited eagerly in the market.

This year, traders fear a huge dip in production due to the scarcity of rain in both Amravati and Nagpur divisions. As of Thursday, all the orange-growing districts have reported rainfall deficiency ranging between 22 and 40 per cent. Moisture stress has led to wilting of flowers, which is set to affect production. Milind Falke, an orange grower from Amravati, said not even 30 per cent of last year’s production can be achieved. “Prices will be high but farmers will have very little to sell,” he said.

Echoing his views, Rohan Ursal, a trader in Pune’s Gultekdi market, said the 70 per cent dip in production will shoot up prices. Last year, while demonetisation had resulted in prices crashing but this year the production dip will lead to prices shooting up. At present, arrival of oranges from Ahmednagar has been slow as out-of-state traders are sealing deals at farm gate levels. Ursal said the prices of Nagpur oranges will easily cross Rs 50 per kg at the wholesale end and retail prices will be higher.

Rajesh Chabarani, an orange trader from Nagpur, said during the peak season the local markets normally see arrival of 1,000 tonnes of the fruit per day.

Virginia city to hold memorial service for woman killed in violence,"Car attack victim Heather Heyer’s mother Susan Bro speaks at her memorial service inside the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. (Source: Reuters) Car attack victim Heather Heyer’s mother Susan Bro speaks at her memorial service inside the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. (Source: Reuters)

A 32-year-old woman killed when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville was to be remembered on Wednesday at a memorial service in this southern US college town. Heather Heyer was killed after hours of clashes on Saturday between white nationalists attending a “Unite the Right” gathering and counter-protesters.

Fall-out from the incident has become the biggest domestic challenge faced yet by President Donald Trump, who was assailed from across the political spectrum over his initial response blaming “many sides” for the unrest.

On Monday, the Republican president bowed to political pressure and denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan by name, but on Tuesday he inflamed tensions again by insisting that counter-protesters were also to blame.

Alvin Edwards, pastor of Charlottesville’s Mt Zion First African Baptist Church, was due to address the memorial for Heyer at the city’s historic Paramount Theater, which opened in 1931 and is located near the spot where she died. Her parents, Susan Diane Bro and Mark Heyer, asked people attending the service at 11 am ET (1500 GMT) to wear purple, her favorite color.

Residents of the usually quiet, liberal-leaning Virginia city were shocked by the weekend violence they said was brought by outsiders.

At a community meeting on Monday night, Edwards called on residents to continue to work to make Charlottesville a less appealing place for white supremacists to protest. “One of the things I want to make sure we do as a community and as a city is that we have to stand up and show the strength that we have in our community,” Edwards said, adding that he was

stunned to be facing Ku Klux Klan sympathizers more than a half-century after the height of the civil rights movement.

White nationalists called Saturday’s rally to protest plans to remove a statue of General Robert E Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army in the US Civil War.

Outside the Paramount Theater on Wednesday morning, artist Sam Welty was chalking a 7-1/2 foot (2.3 meter) high portrait of Heyer on a memorial wall nearby, where many tributes to the slain woman have been written. “The way she lost her life, doing what she did, really stood for Charlottesville. It makes me wish that I knew her,” Welty, 42, said as he worked on the portrait.

“It’s a shame that people who don’t live here had to come and unleash hate and violence and put Charlottesville on the world map for something that it does not deserve.”

James Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who is said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, has been charged with murder, malicious wounding and fleeing the scene. Nineteen other people were injured in the incident.

On her way to work at a Charlottesville insurance office, Stephanie Sherwood, 28, said she had always lived in the city, and had never seen anything like Saturday’s events. “I cannot believe that in 2017 we are still dealing with white supremacists and neo-Nazis,” she said, adding that Trump’s remarks on Tuesday made her very angry.

“He went off the rails yesterday, but I think he really showed who he is as a person,” Sherwood said.

Mayweather and McGregor will fight in smaller gloves,"The bout is set to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on August 26. (Source: Reuters) The bout is set to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on August 26. (Source: Reuters)

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor will fight with smaller gloves, though not nearly as small as the ones McGregor is used to wearing.

Nevada boxing regulators on Wednesday gave the two fighters an exemption to a rule requiring 10-ounce gloves, approving 8-ounce gloves for the Aug. 26 bout. Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada Athletic Commission to request the waiver.

Commissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.

Under Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.

Commission Chairman Anthony Marnell led the way in approving the smaller gloves, but not before chastising the two camps for using the issue as a pawn in social media to try and sell tickets for the event.

Suspect falls to death from atop crane at Los Angeles port,"A suspected car thief led police on a chase across Los Angeles before he ditched the vehicle and climbed to the top of a loading crane at the city’s port, dangling over edges and stripping naked before falling to his death. The man fell about 160 feet to the ground and died about three hours after he first scaled the crane Wednesday night. It’s not clear whether he slipped or jumped deliberately, Los Angeles fire officials said.

Police in Los Angeles spotted the car reported stolen from a dealership in San Bernardino, and an hours-long chase ensued, the LAPD said. Several television stations broadcast the chase live, showing the SUV swerving at high speed through freeway traffic in LA and Long Beach, sometimes crossing into oncoming lanes.

He drove into the vast complex of the Port of Los Angeles and drove into a terminal, circling back and forth under giant loading cranes and next to a docked ship before jumping out of the still-moving SUV and racing up the stairs of the crane. He broke a window and climbed into the crane cab, then climbed out, walked to the end of the crane over water as darkness fell.

Port workers stopped their labor and watched the scene, some with binoculars. Police waited below for him for hours, worried that if they approached he might slip or jump.

As news helicopters hovered above, he shed his Lakers jersey and shoes, then later took off the rest of his clothes. He dangled and nearly fell several times before eventually plunging to the ground. “Our officers were nowhere near to close proximity of the suspect at the time that he fell,” Detective Meghan Aguilar said. The man’s name has not been released. Eric Nosser, a salesman at the Subaru dealership the SUV was stolen from, says he steered clear of the man.

“I let him be, because he seemed on edge,” Nosser told KNBC-TV. “I figured he’d just kind of walk off and go about his business.” Instead the man found an SUV with the keys in it, got inside and took off.

Michelle Wie benched for morning matches as Europe go with rookie Hall,"Michelle Wie is among the four Americans left on the bench for the morning matches. (Source: Reuters) Michelle Wie is among the four Americans left on the bench for the morning matches. (Source: Reuters)

Nine-time veteran Cristie Kerr and long-hitting Lexi Thompson will lead off for the United States against Europe’s Mel Reid and Charley Hull when the 15th Solheim Cup starts in Iowa on Friday.

Four foursomes (alternate shot) matches will be played in the morning at Des Moines Golf & Country Club, followed by four four-ball matches in the afternoon.

Glamour girl Michelle Wie is among the four Americans left on the bench for the morning matches by captain Juli Inkster. “I don’t really want to have to play somebody five matches,” said Inkster, who is confident her team’s bench strength will be decisive as they defend the Cup they won in Germany two years ago.

“So someone’s going to have to sit sometimes. And I want everybody to try to play at least three matches.” Europe captain Annika Sorenstam does not have the luxury of resting her top players, even more so following the withdrawal of top gun Suzann Pettersen, who has a bad back.

Only one European, number 13 Anna Nordqvist, is ranked in the top 20 in the world, while the U.S. has four players — number two Thompson, as well as Kerr, Stacy Lewis and Danielle Kang.

“We decided that we wanted to have one rookie in the morning, which is Georgia (Hall), so we decided to go out with some more veteran players early on,” said Sorenstam, who will sit out her other three rookies, Florentyna Parker, Emily Pederson and Madelene Sagstrom.

The U.S. lead 9-5 since the competition began in 1990 and are heavily favoured by bookmakers to win. The Americans are 6-1 at home, with Europe’s lone victory on American soil coming four years ago in Colorado.

But there will be no complacency on the American side, said Lewis. “I don’t think that’s a word that’s even been spoken,” said the former world number one.

“Juli has been on us about playing our games and working hard. She gave us hard hats to start the week. We’re here to do our work, and that’s kind of the model we took into Germany (two years ago).

Lessons from Gorakhpur,"At least 71 children lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7. (Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) At least 71 children lost their lives due to encephalitis since August 7. (Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

The Gorakhpur tragedy has two very pertinent facets and it is important to separate them. The first, obviously, is the acute face of the tragedy: the shortage of oxygen supply in the critical care unit of a tertiary care public hospital. The second is the failure of India’s public health system, which has allowed “encephalitis” to become an annual outbreak in the region.

Let us begin with the latter.

‘Encephalitis’ is a misnomer. The correct expression is Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) — an umbrella term for diseases with certain characteristic symptoms. So when you hear “encephalitis” in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar mentioned in the same breath, be cautious. They are very different diseases, apart from their presentations.

From a policy perspective, this generalisation could have had disastrous public health consequences. For long, annual “encephalitis” outbreaks in the adjoining districts of Gorakhpur and Kushinagar were thought to be rooted in Japanese Encephalitis (JE). JE is caused by a virus that is found in pigs, water birds and livestock, and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. UP has introduced JE vaccination in its routine immunisation schedule, and has organised, for several years now, special vaccination drives before summer. In 2013, when this writer was reporting the outbreak for The Indian Express, the administration in Gorakhpur boasted of over 90% vaccine coverage. But somewhere around mid-August, these were the numbers: a total 226 admissions and 59 deaths in Gorakhpur, and 248 cases and 43 deaths in Kushinagar. Of these, five patients in Gorakhpur and eight in Kushinagar had tested positive for JE.

In 2012, however, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) identified 100 isolates of organisms called enteroviruses (EV) — specifically the human EV 89 and EV 76 types — from 1,000 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children admitted to Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital. As scientists told this writer then, 10% positivity is considered a great testing success in CSF samples. These enteroviruses spread through contaminated water, and trigger symptoms very similar to JE. And they are, of course, included under the ambit of the generalised, convenient term, ‘AES’. Thus, in Gorakhpur, most children did not get sick after being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus; they merely had very bad quality water.

In Bihar the same year, scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other experts argued for classifying “encephalitis” outbreaks as Acute Neurological Syndrome (ANS) after carrying out their first investigation in Muzaffarpur district. They published the results of their investigation in The Lancet this year, identifying a toxicological root in the litchis grown in the district.

***

Clearly, epidemiological investigation, a key discipline in public health, and central to understanding the root of “mystery” diseases, has been chaotic in both UP and Bihar for almost a decade. The system has been reactive — busy treating symptoms rather than getting decisive, coordinated answers for, and targeting the roots of, disease.

In 1981, epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose described a phenomenon called the ‘Prevention Paradox’ — the public health dogma that preventive interventions that benefit entire populations have very little or no tangible impact on individual health. Thus, they are not appreciated enough, even though they save the public health system a lot of money.

Vaccination is perhaps a more individual approach to public health. Every child is vaccinated, and there is the psychological impact of benefitting from an intervention. Obviously, when the target is a vaccine-preventable disease like polio or even JE, vaccines work wonders, and their importance cannot be overemphasised in population health. However, in this case in UP and Bihar, should JE vaccination have been made the only poster public health intervention? In Gorakhpur, NIV scientists have been pointing to enteroviruses since 2005-06. But neither the UPA’s erstwhile Total Sanitation Campaign nor the present government’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan targeted this actively.

***

Now consider the acute events that led to the present crisis. It is a blot on India’s public health system that handheld “ambu-bags” are a characteristic feature of government hospital emergencies — not just in “interior” districts like Gorakhpur, but also in Delhi and Mumbai. This is a commentary on how lost we are in health financing, payment and delivery mechanisms, despite many continuing policy experiments.

So, after all the PPPs, performance-based incentives, RFPs and RFQ models, and the debates around universal healthcare, social insurance, single- and multi-payer payment systems, it is a travesty that not only was the one tertiary health facility in a 300-km radius dependent on a contract and a subcontract for the supply of oxygen in its ICU, dues of less than $ 10,000 were delayed so long — and that finally, despite being cleared by the state Health Department, payment to the supplier was held up in administrative bottlenecks.

But then again, this is no surprise. One of the images that stands out for this writer from her reporting in 2013 is that of the new 100-bed AES ward in BRD College, with 25 new ventilators purchased that year, but lying unused despite the growing number of patients, because the installation of oxygen pipelines had missed deadlines.

There is a slide that Harvard health economist Peter Berman always uses in his classes. It is from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland:

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

“I don’t much care where…,” said Alice.

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

“…so long as I get Somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.

Health systems scholars, funding agencies and policy thinktanks like the World Bank, IMF, and Oxfam have many disagreements. But the one thing that most agree on is the need for evidence-based action, as opposed to running in the dark, in search of Alice’s “somewhere”.

For every public health problem, this entails determining a goal, identifying an intervention that can help achieve that goal, ensuring a monitoring system to check for problems and course correction along the way and, finally at its conclusion, having a system for evaluating what the programme achieved, and where it failed. Introducing these seemingly logical steps for health policy decisions remains a challenge in India.

Experts like the Harvard economist William Hsiao have long argued for identifying “control knobs” to overhaul health systems at the roots, against knee-jerk approaches to policy conundrums. Many of these classic control knobs can be traced to the present escalation: “financing, payment, regulation, organisation”. These could be the routes towards targeted policy solutions to course-correct.

It must be pointed out here that UP, or even India, is no exception. Countries with higher income levels and with far bigger health budgets, too, are struggling to identify the right models for financing and delivering public health. Among OECD countries, the United States is a classic example of poor health outcomes despite gross overspending on health. It is now well established that while health budgets are critical, spending money alone is not enough. This is, of course, not to undermine the problems resulting from sectors like health and education historically getting the short end of the stick in India.

There is increasing realisation, however, that public health delivery is a complex story, entrenched in cultures of governance, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms on the one hand, and social structures, gender roles, income levels and inequalities on the other. The latter are classified under the “social determinants” of health. And as Gorakhpur has shown, it is always the poorest who face the brunt of poor health policies, management and financing.

Venezuela officials raid home of fired dissident attorney general Luisa Ortega,"Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/Files Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/Files

Venezuelan intelligence officers raided the home of the former attorney general, who was fired this month after she broke ranks with President Nicolas Maduro, while her replacement urged the arrest of her lawmaker husband.

Four motorbikes and seven patrol cars belonging to the SEBIN intelligence service were seen outside the Caracas home of the ex-attorney general, Luisa Ortega, AFP journalists observed. “At this moment SEBIN is searching my home as revenge by this government for my fight against totalitarianism,” Ortega wrote on Twitter yesterday.

She did not say where she and her husband were. Ortega was sacked two weeks ago as the first act of a new supreme assembly loyal to Maduro that has set about quashing dissent and hemming in the opposition, which controls the rival legislature.

Earlier yesterday, her successor, Tarek William Saab, said he had asked officials to go after Ortega’s husband, German Ferrer, a former loyalist lawmaker who has split from the ruling Socialist Party. The charges have “nothing to do with” the political leanings of Ferrer or Ortega, Saab said.

He accused Ferrer of being part of a network trying to extort money from businessmen linked to Venezuela’s all-important oil sector, promising them protection from prosecution on corruption allegations in exchange for money.

A decision on whether to grant an arrest warrant against Ferrer — who has parliamentary immunity — rests with Venezuela’s supreme court, which up to now has systematically sided with Maduro. Ortega in recent weeks accused Maduro of “dictatorial ambitions.”

She rebelled against his administration in April when the supreme court tried — before reversing course — to assume the powers of the legislative National Assembly. Her criticism sharpened when Maduro then set about creating the rival Constituent Assembly, which is packed with his supporters.

Most major countries in the Americas, including the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile have dismissed the Constituent Assembly as illegitimate and a tool to undermine Venezuelan democracy.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured.

Here’s how Twitterati reacted to the Barcelona attack:

Chinese fans tell ‘homesick boy’ Carlos Tevez to stay away,"Carlos Tevez flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury. (Source: File) Carlos Tevez flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury. (Source: File)

Chinese football fans and media are urging underperforming Carlos Tevez not to return from a trip to Argentina, nicknaming him “Very Homesick Boy” as speculation swirls that he wants out of China.

The 33-year-old Argentine former international has been a flop since moving this year to Shanghai Shenhua on a fat salary, scoring only twice, missing half the games through injury and having his commitment repeatedly questioned by fans.

Tevez, who has previously suggested he would look to leave after the season, flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury.

The trip has fuelled suspicions that he may not return, though the Chinese Super League (CSL) club told AFP this week Tevez was expected back by the end of the month.

Shanghai Shenhua made Tevez one of the best-paid players in the world when they signed him in January from Boca Juniors on reported weekly wages of around 730,000 euros ($850,000).

But the former Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus star has failed to settle and has been christened by supporters and media in China as “Very Homesick Boy” — a play on how his name is pronounced in Chinese.

The label is also an apparent reference to Tevez’s falling-out with then-City boss Roberto Mancini, when Tevez refused to warm up as a substitute in the last moments of a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in September 2011.

Tevez flew back to Argentina and considered retiring, before eventually returning to England in February 2012.

Many football fans on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, criticised Tevez.

“He won’t need to come back in person. I’ll deliver his luggage to logistics companies,” said one posting. “Tevez shamelessly went back to Argentina. Don’t ever come back,” said another.

“Shenhua’s highest-paid yet worst foreign player. As a Shenhua fan since 1994, the club’s management this season is the worst ever,” added another.

Shenhua say that a break in the CSL season made it a good opportunity for Tevez to seek rehabilitation back in Argentina and that the decision to let him go was made after discussions between the player and the club’s medical team.

Qatar expressed concern about the safety of its citizens in Saudi Arabia following the reopening of the countries’ border enabling Qataris to attend the annual haj pilgrimage in Mecca. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said during a visit to Norway that Saudi authorities had yet to respond to queries from the Qatari Ministry of Islamic Affairs regarding the security of Qatari citizens during haj.

“The level of tension between the two nations, the language and the tone of the Saudi media spreading hatred against Qatari people represents a great concern for us,” he told a news conference.

“Those people crossing the border right now are under the responsibility of the Saudi authorities for their security and safety,” he said, adding that “more than 100” citizens had crossed since the border was reopened.

Cricket Australia announces limited overs squad for India tour,"Steve Smith will lead Australia during their tour of India. (Source: Express Archive) Steve Smith will lead Australia during their tour of India. (Source: Express Archive)

Cricket Australia on Friday announced the respective squads for their tour of India which will take place September-October. The ODI squad consists of 14 members while the T20I squad has 13 players. The AUstralian team would be led by Steve Smith while David Warner would play the role of his deputy.

Speaking on the selection of the ODI Squad, National Selector Trevor Hohns said:

“We believe the panel has selected a strong squad to face the tough Indian conditions, that has the right mix of pace and spin,” he said.

Nathan Coulter-Nile is back from injury and he has made a place in this team. “Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series,” said the national selector.

“James Faulkner is a solid One-Day campaigner and is very familiar with sub-continent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope that he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,” he added.

“Hilton is an aggressive striker of the ball and we think his game will be well suited to the transition to short-form cricket,” concluded Hohns.

Speaking on the T20 International squad, T20 National Selector Mark Waugh said:

“The overall standards being set in the BBL and also the IPL are very high and the players selected have impressed in these tournaments,” said Waugh.

Mitchell Starc has been dropped as he is still returning from injury in right foot.

Bupa Support Staff Physiotherapist David Beakley said:

“We have recently reviewed the progress of Mitchell’s right foot injury and the healing process has been slower than we would have liked.

“Consequently, in order to ensure his best possible preparation for the Ashes, he will be unavailable for the Tour of India and will continue his rehab in Australia with an aim to have him play for New South Wales in the domestic one-day cup.”

Taiwan official resigns after blackout hits much of island,"Taiwan’s economy minister has resigned after a generator failure at a power plant caused a massive blackout that affected millions of households across the island during sweltering heat. The power outage plunged traffic, shopping malls and offices into darkness early last evening.

Taiwan’s Central News Agency says “an operational technical error” caused six generators to stop working at Taiwan’s biggest natural gas power plant. Taiwan’s economy minister Lee Chih-kung apologised at a news conference and said the person who made the error would be punished.

CNA says 6.68 million households were affected in the capital, Taipei, cities Taichung and Tainan and three counties in the center, west and southwest of the island of 23 million people. The defense ministry said back-up power supply ensured no disruption to military operations.

China hasn’t shared monsoon river data: India,"A view of the mighty Brahmaputra river, that floods every year in the state (File Photo by Vishnu Varma) A view of the mighty Brahmaputra river, that floods every year in the state (File Photo by Vishnu Varma)

Buoyed by support from Japan over the Doklam border stand-off, India Friday upped the ante against China, saying that the country has not shared “hydrological data” on the Brahmaputra river since May 15, which is a violation of bilateral pacts. New Delhi’s assertion comes against the backdrop of severe floods in Assam and Bihar.

India has also confirmed the incident at Pangong lake in Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese soldiers reportedly engaged in a scuffle, and said that this is “not in the interests of two sides” and that they should maintain “peace and tranquility”. Besides, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs refrained from confirming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Xiamen in China for the BRICS summit from September 3 to 5.

The three elements, taken together, is being viewed as part of India’s pushback on China’s high-decibel rhetoric over the standoff, including a video recently released by its official news agency Xinhua that has been accused of using racist undertones to ridicule Indians. “I don’t want to dignify the video with a comment,” said Raveesh Kumar, the MEA spokesperson in his first official briefing.

“The hydrological data is shared every year, between May 15 to October 15, during the monsoon season. This data has not been shared so far,” said Kumar, adding that the two countries have two agreements, in 2013 and 2015, on sharing the data. The hydrological data is shared by upper riparian states to lower riparian states every monsoon, so that the flow of the water can be anticipated, and measures can be taken to deal with flooding.

However, Kumar said, the non-sharing of hydrological data by China “cannot be linked” to the current stand-off as there could be technical reasons. “It will be premature to link it,” he said. The hydrological data has not been shared by China for Sutlej river as well. Asked about incident between Chinese and Indian troops in Ladakh on August 15, the MEA spokesperson said, “I can confirm that there was an incident on August 15. It was discussed by local army commanders between two sides. We feel that such incidents are not in the interests of either side. They should maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC.”

Kumar said two border personnel meetings (BPMs) had taken place between Indian border guards and Chinese troops recently — one at Chushul on August 16 and the other at Nathu La, a week before. Asked about Modi’s possible visit to China for the BRICS summit, Kumar said, “I have to first confirm whether the PM is indeed going to China. There are established mechanisms about announcements of Prime Minister’s outgoing visits. At present, I am not in a position to announce.”

Asked whether he was adding an element of uncertainty to the trip, Kumar said that such announcements are made “a few days” before the visit. On Japanese Ambassador Kenji Hiramatsu’s support to India and Bhutan on Doklam border stand-off, the spokesperson said the Japanese envoy’s comments “speak for itself”, and that he would not like to delve into who has given “memos of support”. Rejecting China’s claim that Bhutan had accepted that Doklam belonged to Chinese territory, the MEA spokesperson said they would go by what Bhutan said in its statement on June 29.

On the way forward, he said New Delhi would continue to engage with China to find a mutually acceptable solution to the stand-off, asserting that peace and tranquility on the border is an important pre-requisite for smooth bilateral relationship. “We will continue to engage with China to find a mutually acceptable solution,” Kumar said.

Asked for his opinion on when the Doklam stand-off would end, he said, “To answer this question, I will have to be an astrologer. Since I am not an astrologer, I will let it pass.”

"What makes Britain’s biggest ever warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, special","The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS) The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS)

Thousands of enthusiasts on Wednesday lined up at the Portsmouth seafront, to welcome what is said to be the biggest-ever warship of Britan. Named HMS Queen Elizabeth, the 280 meters long vessel weighing 65,000 tonnes cost more than 3 billion-pound to build.

The vessel that was in construction since 2009 has been training at sea since June after setting out from Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the vessel also has an identical sister ship called HMS Prince of Wales, which will be commissioned three years later. Both the carriers built for the Royal Navy will replace the now-decommissioned HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious and will lead the UK’s Naval Force for the coming years.

HMS Queen Elizabeth has a speed of 25 knots per hour that can help it to cover a distance of 500 miles per day. The gigantic ship weighs three times the size of its predecessor, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal. Few of the on-board features include a hospital, a police office, commanding officer’s suite and a bakery as well. The ship is also equipped with 1,000 twin propellers that generate power that can run 1,000 cars.

The vessel also has an in-built reverse osmosis equipment that can produce 500 tones of fresh water each day. As a result, the ship can play an essential role in providing humanitarian relief in cases of a crisis. The carrier will also provide a four-acre military operating base to the armed forces.

The war ship is also equipped with a fully integrated waste management system that ensures proper sanitary processing, storage and destruction of any kind of waste for the next 50 years. It also comes with a Glass Processing Equipment that helps in crushing compact glass products that can be further recycled.

The war-ship is also equipped with a cutting-edge 3D radar system known as Artisan 3D that makes it capable of detecting tiniest objects at a distance of 25 km. According to the builder Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the radar system can monitor more than 800 objects simultaneously from 200 to 200,000 metres and cut through radio interference equal to 10,000 mobile phone signals. The radar system has already proven its capability to deliver uncompromising air defence and anti-ship operations on the Type 23 frigate and helicopter carrier. The system will also be used for the first time to deliver air traffic management, providing the aircraft carriers with unparalleled awareness and control of the skies around them.

The range of the ship is 10,000 nautical miles. Few of the works for which the ship will be used include high intensity war fighting, disaster management and providing humanitarian aid.

“She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role,” Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said while welcoming the ship at its home port in southern England.

NITI Aayog event: PM Modi asks start-ups to devise tools for better governance,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event in New Delhi. PTI photo Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event in New Delhi. PTI photo

Stressing that the government alone cannot build a New India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday prodded young entrepreneurs to devise systems and solutions that help in “improving governance”. Seeking participation of different sections of society in improving governance, he said that in earlier times, “the role of the government was very limited” and social initiatives catered to the requirements of people in fields such as education and healthcare. He also highlighted the measures taken by the government to uproot corruption.

“… thoda sa peeche chale jaayen, zyaada nahin 50 saal karib, to hame dhyaan aayega ki sarkaar ki presence bahut hi kam sthaan par thi. Samajik rachna hi aisi thi, jo samaj vyavasthaon ko bal deti thi. (If we go back around 50 years, then we will see that the presence of government was very limited. The society was such that it gave importance to social institutions),” Modi said.

He said the government is taking steps to uproot corruption that had become institutionalised, and promised more measures to ease the common man’s problems. “It is unfortunate that corruption had become institutionalised. Till you make a counter institutional arrangement, you cannot stop it,” Modi said while addressing over 200 start-up entrepreneurs at the Champions of Change event organised by Niti Aayog.

The Prime Minister said that only governments and their initiatives will not make a New India, while encouraging entrepreneurs to participate in government initiatives. “Change will be powered by each and every citizen of India,” he said. Stressing on how the government has tried to change discretionary systems, Modi said the government has allowed anyone to nominate people for Padma awards.

“Padma awards in past were given on ministers’ recommendation. We removed this barrier and made it open to anyone for nomination. We have made a small reform. Now anyone can recommend a person for Padma award online. Now, unknown heroes are getting recognised,” he said. The government has invited nominations for the Padma Awards, 2018 by September 15, 2017. The nominations for the Padma awards can be made only online on a portal designed by ministry of home affairs.

Giving another example of a similar reform, he said the government removed the need for getting official documents to be certified by MPs, MLAs or gazetted officers. Reposing its trust in the citizens, Modi said the government replaced the earlier system with the requirement of only self certification. The government has also done away with the need for interviews in case of applicants seeking Group C and D level job positions in the Union government, he said.

Asking young entrepreneurs to innovate and suggest solutions to deal with issues, Modi said he would like Champions of Change event to be an annual feature. He said the different groups of entrepreneurs, which were set up to suggest policy initiatives, could be attached with the relevant ministries on a permanent basis. Six groups of young entrepreneurs made presentations to the PM on subjects such as soft power, Incredible India 2.0, education & skilling; health, Digital India and New India by 2022.

Emphasising the importance of good teachers, Modi said technology can provide a big boost to the quality of education.

Thousands of Brazilian police and soldiers have carried out a security operation near Rio de Janeiro as part of a crackdown aimed at curbing rising violence. Operation “Double Dose” focused on the Caramujo slum complex early Wednesday in the city of Niteroi, which neighbors Rio.

The Rio de Janeiro state government said in a statement that more than 3,000 police officers and soldiers were involved. They arrested 16 organized crime suspects and also seized tactical gear, radio transmitters and a small amount of drugs.

Violence has been on the rise in Rio since the end of the Olympics a year ago, with gangs operating in hundreds of slums. Last month the federal government deployed 8,500 soldiers to fight organized crime in Rio.

Speaking of Ramanujan,"When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez. When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary — urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‘Fear No Fall’, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‘possession’.

What makes Rodriguez’s volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR’s own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‘both context sensitive and reflexive’, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet — chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR’s journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‘Between’ becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as “the hyphen in Indo-American studies”.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself “a multiple monolingual”. In another: “It looks as if I live between things all the time — two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.” Or, yet again: “The whole question of roots is not relevant to me… India is me and with me…” And again, ‘It takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.’

AKR’s image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: “[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky… Each had a literature that was unlike the others…and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.”

There is no cultural machismo here — no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky — always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‘have to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet’. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet’s capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary — more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

Top India players and international stars will vie for honours when curtains go up on the inaugural edition of the Rs 50 lakh Indian Cue Masters League starting in Ahmedabad on Saturday .

The opening tie of the Cue Slam promises to light up the league as Indian billiards and snooker’s poster boy Pankaj Advani leads Chennai Strikers’ charge against Welsh Wizard Andrew Pagett’s Gujarat Kings.

Delhi Dons will take on Bengaluru Buddies in the other encounter tomorrow. “We have a great team and are confident of going all the

way,” Pagett declared, pointing towards Indian stalwarts: former Asian snooker champion Alok Kumar, Brijesh Damani and

Sourav Kothari.

The presence of three-time European Ladies Team champion Daria Sirotina from Russia makes it a truly formidable combination.

“We have experience and youth on our side. We will take some beating,” Advani, a 16-time world champion, said. “The skill of veteran Dharminder Lilly and Faisal Khan and the energy of Vidya Pillai and Pandu Rangaiah makes it a perfect mix,” he added.

The seven-day league will see five teams — Delhi Dons, Bengaluru Buddies and Hyderabad Hustlers being the other three — fight it out in an enthralling round-robin cum knockout format.

Each tie will have three 6-Red snooker and two 9-Ball pool matches. Each team boasts of five players (1 icon player, 1 female player and 3 men players, with the stipulation that at least three of them are Indians).

“Cue Slam is a great step forward,” Pagett, who endeared himself to the country’s snooker fans by winning the Indian Open in 2015, said.

“It will take the sport to the masses and I am glad to be a part of the home team,” he added.

“India has been waiting for a League like this. I am happy to see that it is taking off, that too with so many top players in fray,” Pankaj said.

The opening day’s second tie between Bengaluru and Delhi is expected to be equally fascinating. Bengaluru Buddies have roped in one of the biggest names in the sport, Darren Morgan, who will be joined by Anastasia Nechaeva from Russia and the Indian trio of Laxman Rawat, Varun Madan and Sandeep Gulati.

Delhi Dons, on the other hand, will be captained by six-time World Snooker and seven-time European Champion Kelly Fisher. The British player has Wales’ Laura Evans and India’s Malkeet Singh, Manan Chandra and Pushpender Singh to muster up a fight for her team.

The Hyderabad Hustlers will launch their campaign against the Gujarat Lions on Sunday.

70 years of Independence: How Communists kept pestering the British throughout the freedom struggle,"Chittagong Armoury raid in 1930 saw the participation of Communist leaders, though the movement was eventually suppressed. However, it managed to send the alarm bell ringing for the Britishers.

As the country commemorates its 70th year of Independence Day, honouring thousands of stalwarts and freedom fighters who laid down lives for the vision of Independent India, only a few would acknowledge the contribution of Communists in the freedom movement up to 1947. Despite generally being neglected and discarded in the historiography of India’s glorious freedom movement, it has to be accepted that the Communists played a crucial role in the country’s freedom struggle,

While the Communists were ideologically at loggerheads with the Indian National Congress (INC), even Viceroy Lord Irwin, in his 1929 speech to the Legislative Assembly, stated that “the disquieting spread of Communist doctrines has been causing anxiety” and declared that the government would take strict measures. But the Communists believed India’s freedom could neither be achieved through British government’s reforms nor by Congress’ idea of peaceful means. For them, socialism was the only way to emancipate the masses from poverty and destitution, once the country is freed from the imperialist rule.

During the period of 1920-29, a series of conspiracy cases had been levelled against the Communists, including the Meerut Conspiracy case (1929) which resulted in harsh prison sentences. In fact, the Communist Party of India (CPI) was an illegal party for most of the time under the British rule. It was only in 1937 when the Congress ministries came to power in several states that the ban was lifted. But it had to go underground again in 1940, and could only start functioning openly after it supported the anti-fascist allies in the World War II.

Apart from being the first to endorse socialism, the Communists were also the first to advocate complete independence and raise it before the National Congress. At the 1921 session of the INC, Maulana Hazrat Mohani and Swami Kumaranand moved the resolution for complete independence for the first time. Signed by M N Roy and Abani Mukherjee, the manifesto called upon the Congress to adopt complete independence as its mission and render full support to the struggles of the working class and peasantry.

Ambedkar at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s reception in 1949. Maulana Hazrat Mohani and Swami Kumaranand moved the resolution for complete independence for the first time in 1921. (Source: Wikipedia)

The year 1928 also saw the Communists succeed in forming big unions, leading plenty of strike-struggles of the working class while advocating complete independence of the country. Workers strike in Bombay, in which railway, textile and municipal workers participated when the Simon Commission reached the port of Bombay, became a part of the national movement for boycotting the Commission.

Although the Mahatma Gandhi-led Congress initially opposed the resolution and sought Dominion status till 1929, the party eventually adopted Purna Swarajya as its objective in 1930. Subsequently, the CPI came up with its own Platform of Action in 1930, listing out a complete programme for achieving independence. Determined to oust the colonisers, the platform emphasised a radical change while calling for confiscation and nationalisation of all 13 British factories, banks, railways, sea and river transport and plantations. Among other outstanding demands included an eight-hour working day and improvement in conditions of labour.

Before the launch of the platform, the Communists had gradually started striking a chord among the workers, the peasants and youth. Sensing their rising power, the British government countered with a spree of cases against Communists in Peshawar and Cawnpore in which stalwarts like Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani, S A Dange and Das Gupta were sent to prison.

Meanwhile, revolutionary Mastarda Surya Sen’s daring Chittagong Armoury raid in 1930 saw the participation of Communist leaders, though the movement was eventually suppressed. However, it managed to send the alarm bell ringing for the Britishers.

In 1934, the Communists succeeded in organising an all-India textile strike with the help of other trade unions as the working class wave continued to surge a year before. The release of political prisoners—mostly jailed in the Andaman and elsewhere—was one of the major demands of the strike.

Later, the Communists joined forces with the Congress but refrained from surrendering their class outlook and their revolutionary approach to the national liberation struggle. Many left-leaning political activists joined the newly-formed Congress Socialist Party under the leadership of Jayprakash Narayan. The alliance resulted in the rapid growth of Communist influence and of the Communist Party, which made great strides in Bengal, Andhra, Madras and the states of Travancore and Cochin.

The Communists along with Congress socialists deftly utilised the period of Congress Ministries to mobilise the peasants with an aim to raise anti-imperialist consciousness among them to face the impending battle against imperialism. The peasant movement received a shot in the arm following the victory of the Congress at the provincial polls in 1937. Formed in 1936, the Kisan Sabha’s membership witnessed a jump of half a million by the time it met in its second session at Commilla.

When war started in 1939, the Communists were the first to launch an anti-war protest strike, which witnessed the participation of more than 90,000 workers in Bombay in 1940. They believed that people across the world had been dragged into a destructive war by the imperialist powers. However, following Hitler’s attack on the USSR, the Communists underwent a change in their narrative and realised that the victory of the anti-fascist combination headed by the USSR was in the interest of the people of the world as well as in the interest of the national freedom struggle of India.

While supporting the war, the Party had then called for the establishment of a national government–a Congress-League government at the Centre–so that the country’s war efforts should not be in the hands of the Britishers. By this time, the Hindu-Muslim dilemma had reached the point where the demand for Pakistan was floated by the League.

Between 1945 and 1946, the British government received a sample of the Indian mind when they put on trail the officers (Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Sahgal and Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon) of the Indian National Army. The Hindu and Muslim masses came out together despite differences and put up formidable demonstrations because of which arrested officers had to be released. In February 1946, Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Army in Bombay, Karachi and Madras launched a rebellion against Britishers with naval ratings carrying the Communist Party flag and raising slogans of the Jai Hind, Inquilab Zindabad, Hindus and Muslims Unite, and Down with British Imperialism in Bombay. While the naval rebellion was condemned by Sardar Patel, the Communist Party backed the strikers.

Along with naval uprising, 1946 also witnessed militant peasantry struggles across the country as the Communist Party led the armed Vayalar and Punnapra struggle in the state of Travancore, militant Tebhaga struggle of peasants in Bengal. These actions demonstrated the potential that the peasant struggle led by the working class party could reach.

Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-0 without Cristiano Ronaldo to win Spanish Super Cup,"Real Madrid completed a 5-1 aggregate against Barcelona to win Spanish Super Cup. (Source: AP) Real Madrid completed a 5-1 aggregate against Barcelona to win Spanish Super Cup. (Source: AP)

Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-0 to complete a 5-1 victory on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday, dominating its fiercest rival without the need of Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale.

Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema provided the goals in the second leg for a Madrid side that showed every ounce of confidence that Barcelona sorely lacked.

While Bale was rested on the bench, Ronaldo watched the game from the Santiago Bernabeu stands as he completed the first game of a five-match ban for pushing the referee who sent him off in Sunday’s 3-1 first-leg win.

Asensio filled in perfectly for Madrid’s star, scoring five minutes into the match for his second goal in the season’s curtain raiser. Benzema added a second goal in the 39th after Lucas Vazquez had already hit the post for the hosts.

Last season’s Liga and Champions League winners, Madrid also beat Manchester United to win the European Super Cup last week.

“We played very well in the away leg and we had a great game tonight, above all in the first half, which was spectacular,” Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. “We have to congratulate the players because they were fantastic. You couldn’t notice the changes (to the starting lineup).”

Barcelona struggled to score for a second match since the shocking departure of Neymar on a world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. The closest it went to scoring was Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez hitting the woodwork in the second half after the title was already in Madrid’s grasp.

After seeing his team be soundly beaten on its home pitch in his debut with the team on Sunday, Barcelona’s new coach Ernesto Valverde decided to revamp both his starting 11 and its formation.

He ditched Barcelona’s classic 4-3-3 formation for a 3-5-2, with only Messi and Suarez up front. Neymar had accompanied them for the past four seasons before he bolted for PSG.

Valverde also gave starts to midfielders Andre Gomes and Sergi Roberto and defender Javier Mascherano, in place of Sunday’s starters Aleix Vidal, Gerard Deulofeu and the injured Andres Iniesta. It didn’t matter.

Barcelona had no answer for Madrid’s pressure, lost ball after ball in its own half, and clearly missed Neymar’s presence on the left flank to start quick attacks.

“They showed more energy in their pressure and we suffered when they recovered the ball,” Valverde said. “It’s obvious that we have to recover our spirit quickly.”

The only bright spot on another long night for Barcelona was the positive contribution of Roberto, who provided the only consistent attacking spark besides Messi.

Zidane also rested Francisco “Isco” Alarcon and Casemiro, who went on late. Luka Modric was back from suspension and outplayed all of Barcelona’s midfielders.

Asensio picked up right where he had left the first leg, stunning goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a long strike that floated overhead before landing in the net.

Asensio earned a place in Zidane’s starting 11 after going on as a substitute on Sunday and capping Madrid’s victory by scoring a 90th-minute goal with a long shot that Ter Stegen failed to stop.

The 21-year-old forward started the second leg with a similar superb strike, bending a left-footed shot from well outside the area over a flatfooted Ter Stegen.

Messi needed over 10 minutes to finally touch the ball, and once he did Barcelona showed signs of life with two Messi-led attacks that made Madrid work in defense.

But despite having five midfielders, Barcelona never established control. A bad pass by Mascherano almost led to a goal from Vazquez, who hit the post in the 33rd.

That was just a warning of was about to come when Sergio Busquets lost another ball near Barcelona’s area. Madrid left back Marcelo pounced by sending a low cross into the area, when Benzema twisted around Samuel Umtiti and swept in his goal.

It took almost an hour for Messi to finally produced Barcelona’s first serious threat when he forced Keylor Navas to palm his shot onto the bar in the 53rd.

Suarez headed a rebound of Messi’s strike parried by Navas off the upright in the 71st. The striker finished the match favoring his right knee after running into Navas.

Ram Vilas Paswan On Forming A Mahagatbandhan With The Congress,
Help my only child survive!,"Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org. Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Every evening when Aadya watches children in the neighborhood play, my heart breaks. My daughter too was once an energetic presence rushing about. I know that Aadya longs to join them.

It started after Aadya’s second birthday. She got high fever and rashes all over. The local doctor called it skin allergy and prescribed medicines. The fever persisted, and we sought another medical opinion.

The diagnosis was devastating. B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia – a cancer that affects the immune system. Our only hope now lies in the contributions of caring strangers through ketto.org.

B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Big sounding medical terms that we knew nothing about, but by the look on the doctor’s face, clearly it was serious.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia affects, breaks down the body’s ability to fight diseases. The cancer starts in the bone marrow, where new blood cells grow. These cells grow very fast and the bone marrow’s capacity to make normal cells is reduced.

The doctor said Aadya needed treatment immediately, or else the cancer would spread. From March to December 2016, she was under the care of Dr. Shweta Bansal at the Sir H.N.Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai. Ten months is a long time for a grown person. To watch our only child suffer through so many blood tests and chemotherapy treatments was very painful and difficult.

After ten months, the treatment ended and we were full of hope that Aadya would begin to recover. Then just four months later, in April 2017, we got the terrible news that the leukemia had relapsed. Since then, Aadya has been visiting the hospital for chemotherapy and tests, every 15-30 days.

Today Aadya is three years old and it hurts us to see her childhood being taken away. She barely eats, feels tired and weak all the time, and gets bruised easily. Even the slightest exposure to infection can be dangerous so we mostly keep her at home. She has missed many days of school and plays indoors. Any exposure to dust is dangerous so we have to make sure that her clothes, food, and toys are kept dust-free at all times.

Aadya’s hope is a Bone Marrow Transplant, which costs a staggering Rs 25 lakh. We have started a fundraising page with ketto.org, counting on people’s sense of humanity to help us with this life-saving surgery.

So far we have spent Rs 15 lakh on Aadya’s chemotherapy treatments, medications, and hospital visits. I am a housewife and my husband earns Rs 25,000 working as a back office employee. We are completely dependent on his salary and had to raise the money for the treatment by taking loans, borrowing from family members and friends and through insurance. All that we have managed to raise until now has been used up in the treatment.

A Bone Marrow Transplant surgery will replace Aadya’s damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells, enabling her to lead a normal, healthy life. Her father is a matching and willing donor but we need to put together Rs 25 lakh in the next one month. We have no means of raising that kind of money.

For Aadya to survive, that operation has to be done in one month’s time. For over a year now, Aadya has been fighting a tough, long battle. Now there is hope that this operation will finally end her nightmare and lead to that one final miracle when we can take our baby home.

We have started a fundraising page with Ketto.org in Aadya’s name, in the hope that people will come forward and help us raise the funds for this surgery.

Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Help us to bring Aadya home.

IS cleric granted early release in Indonesia is re-arrested,"A radical Islamic cleric granted an early release from prison to mark Indonesia’s Independence Day has been re-arrested for alleged involvement in several militant attacks. Aman Abdurrahman, who has led an Islamic State group-affiliated militant network from prison, was included among more than 90,000 inmates granted sentence reductions for yesterday’s national holiday.

Ibnu Chuldun, who heads the Justice Ministry’s provincial office in Central Java, said Friday that Abdurrahman was transferred from Nusa Kambangan prison island to a police detention center near Jakarta.

Chuldun says the cleric is being questioned about his role in attacks including a January 2016 suicide bombing in central Jakarta that killed four civilians and four attackers. Abdurrahman was serving a nine-year sentence for helping set up a jihadi training camp.

"Pakistan is ‘sham democracy’: UK, US academics","FILE PHOTO – Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attends the Pakistan Day military parade in Islamabad, Pakistan, March 23, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood/File Photo FILE PHOTO – Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attends the Pakistan Day military parade in Islamabad, Pakistan, March 23, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood/File Photo

Pakistan is a “sham democracy” and with the ouster of Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif by the Supreme Court over Panama Papers case it was felt “more keenly” than before, according to eminent UK and US academics. The top five academics were participating in a seminar held at London University last evening entitled ‘The decline of democracy in Pakistan and the role of the Deep State’.

On July 28, a five-member Supreme Court bench disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty in the Panama Papers case verdict. The apex court ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children, forcing the embattled leader out of office. Kicking off the presentations, Farzana Shaikh, a Pakistani-origin associate fellow at Chatham House, described Pakistan as a “bonsai democracy” or a state restricted by its environment.

“Nowhere has this been more keenly felt in recent times than in the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif by the Pakistani Supreme Court,” the forum said in a statement, adding that Pakistan was a “sham democracy”. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Washington’s Georgetown University, stated Sharif was ousted in a judicial coup.

Fair said she did not view the judiciary in Pakistan as an independent actor but a part of a “new condominium” emerging between the country’s Army and the Supreme Court. “The Army has to develop new tools to keep pruning the grass of democracy to prevent it from taking root in Pakistan,” she said.

Professor Lawrence Sez, professor of political economy in Asia at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, said he had initially considered the ousting of Sharif as a positive step, but has now changed his mind because the disqualification has increased unaccountability in Pakistan.

Burzine Waghmar, a senior teaching fellow at SOAS, highlighted the complicity of Pakistan’s deep state with the “pick up and dump” routine and suppressing the freedom struggle in the Baluchistan province. “Democracy does not seem to be the system of choice among the young in Pakistan and there is a tendency towards a pro-order and/or pro-army view, especially among the more educated youth,” said Professor Marie Carine-Lall, chair of education and South Asian studies at London University’s Institute of Education. This was based on extensive ground level research carried out by her.

Day before I-Day: Punjab govt issues fresh guidelines for schools as per MHRD order,"Earlier, the education department of Punjab has issued letter to the government schools dated August 10 which say that each school has to unfurl tricolor in the campus.

However there was no mention of ‘Sankalp programme’ or oath taking ceremony as mentioned by MHRD

A week after the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) issued guidelines for schools to celebrate Independence Day, the Punjab education department issued fresh guidelines for government schools in line with MHRD orders on Monday.

In its orders dated August 7, MHRD said that schools have to organize ‘Sankalp programme’ near ‘Shaheed Smaraks’ and an oath has to be undertaken vowing removal of corruption, poverty, terrorism, casteism and communalism by 2022 to form a ‘New India’.

Earlier, the education department of Punjab has issued letter to the government schools dated August 10 which say that each school has to unfurl tricolor in the campus. It added that ‘singing national anthem has to be the mandatory and important part of the entire celebrations’.

However there was no mention of ‘Sankalp programme’ or oath taking ceremony as mentioned by MHRD. The fresh orders issued just a day before I-Day (copy with The Indian Express) by the office of Director General of School Education (DGSE) say that schools have to organize Sankalp programme and an oath taking ceremony.

The letter reads, ‘Celebrating 70 years of India’s independence organizing additional activities beside regular programmes. Students should be taken to nearby martrydom memorials and should be told about our freedom fighters. If not taken to memorials, they should be told about freedom fighters on the school campus itself. Then they should be administered an oath vowing removal of corruption, communalism, casteism, poverty and terrorism from the country in next five years.’

A quiz competition for class 11 and 12 has to be organized on the topic ‘Independence Struggle and India’s Development’. The letter further says that students can refer to ‘PM Narendra Modi mobile app’ to download quiz questions.

For class 6 to 10, painting competition on the theme of ‘Independence Movement’ has to be organized by August 30 and the best paintings to be displayed on notice board.

Krishan Kumar, secretary education Punjab said, “We did not receive the letter of MHRD till August 10 when we issued our letter. We never had any objection over MHRD orders. So now we have issued separate instructions as per that letter. However, in our general instructions dated August 10, it is only unfurling of tricolor and singing national anthem which was mandatory.”

The school heads however said that they have not received any orders apart from the letter received on August 10 and issuing such detailed instructions a day before I-Day is a cruel joke by the government.

“We have only received the letter dated August 10 and no instructions on I-Day have come after that yet. Issuing such instructions hours before the I-Day is a sort of cruel joke with the teachers who have to organize everything,” said a principal from a government school in Ludhiana.

China launches probe into Brazilian broiler chicken imports,"China also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. (Representational photo) China also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. (Representational photo)

China on Friday launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of Brazilian broiler chicken and products after a complaint from the domestic industry that the South American country has been selling its chicken below market value. Brazil accounted for more than 50 pct of broiler product supplies to China between 2013 and 2016, a Commerce Ministry statement said on Friday, according to a preliminary review by the local industry and the ministry.

China, the world’s No. 2 poultry consumer, relies on imports for its supply of white feather broiler chickens, which are favoured by fast-food chains like KFC and McDonalds for their more rapid development and plumper meat, compared with yellow-feathered birds, which are native to China and generally sold retail.

The country also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. Any move to penalise imports would be a further blow to Brazil’s meat industry following a scandal over its beef exports earlier in the year, which threatened to tarnish the country’s powerhouse protein industry. China is the biggest national consumer of Brazilian meat.

The move also comes just months after Beijing slapped hefty penalties on sugar imports from top growers such as Brazil and Thailand after lobbying by domestic mills.

Blue Whale: Delhi police keeping an eye on ‘suicide challenge’,"Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter) Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter)

The Delhi Police has alerted its cyber cell unit to keep track of activities related to the ‘Blue Whale challenge’ on social media sites, after four teenagers across the country allegedly took their own lives while completing the challenge-based suicide game.

Stating that the ‘challenge’ caters especially to children, police sources told The Indian Express that a cyber expert team of Delhi Police has been asked to keep an eye on secretive groups through which the game enters social media.

Confirming this, DCP (cyber crime) Anyesh Roy said the team has been tasked with keeping track of any activities related to the game “round the clock”. “We are taking all measures to ensure users are not attracted to such challenges on social media. Certain activities related to this challenge have been noticed on some groups,” the DCP said.

DCP Roy added that police may also issue an advisory to parents and students, if required. “Secretive groups and hashtags are on our radar. We will take action against any site or link that promotes such a game or challenge,” he said.

The Blue Whale Challenge is a game wherein a group of administrators or a certain curator gives a participant a task to complete daily for a period of 50 days — at the end of which the participant is told to commit suicide.

Participants are expected to share photos of the challenges/tasks completed by them. However, there is still uncertainty over how a participant plays the game.

Insolvency proceedings: New form allows homebuyers to seek claims from firms,"The government has introduced a new form under the insolvency law to enable a person who has to receive a payment from an insolvent company to seek the claim. This will enable persons such as homebuyers to make claims for undelivered flats on a company undergoing resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Jaypee Infratech, which is currently under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, has uploaded the new Form-F on its website.

Till now, only financial and operational creditors were permitted to seek claims under the IBC. But Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has amended the regulations whereby claims can be made by creditors other than financial and operational creditors. Such entities should submit proof of their claims to the resolution professional, as per a notification issued by the IBBI.

“The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Fast Track Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2017 provide for forms for submission of claims by operational creditors (including workmen and employees), and financial creditors,” the Board said.

“There could be claims from a creditor who is not a financial creditor or an operational creditor and it needs a specific form for submitting its claim. The IBBI has amended these regulations today to provide for a form (Form F) for submission claims by creditors other than financial and operational creditors,” it added.

The revised regulations come at a time when a large number of flat buyers have been left in the lurch, especially in the National Capital Region, due to long delays in delivery with developers citing fund crunch. According to the notification, the existence of the claim can be verified by way of “documentary evidence demanding satisfaction of the claim … and bank statements of the creditor showing non-satisfaction of claim”, among other options.

Once a case is admitted for insolvency or bankruptcy by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), then an interim resolution professional is appointed to take the process forward. The interim resolution professional would “collect all information relating to the assets, finances and operations of the corporate debtor for determining its financial position.

The United Nations says the death toll from Sierra Leone’s mudslides is now above 400. The U.N. humanitarian agency says 409 bodies have been found after flooding and mudslides in the West African nation’s capital of Freetown on Monday morning. Burials have begun as an estimated 600 people remain missing. People continue to search through tons of mud and debris amid the threat of further mudslides.

The government has warned residents to evacuate a mountainside where a large crack has opened. Rainfall remains in the forecast for the coming days, slowing recovery efforts. Thousands of people have lost their homes. Some critics accuse the government of not learning from past disasters.

Many poor areas are near sea level and lack good drainage. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction.

His love for shoes is well known, but over the last couple of months he has been obsessed with statement-worthy bags. We have seen him flaunt a couple of quirky ones while jet-setting off to exotic locales.

The first one which caught our eyes was a Gucci tote with an embroidered angry cat face on it. We felt it was really quirky and a must-have, until we found the price of his prized possession. It cost a whopping Rs1.5 lakh, a budget that could easily fund a backpacking trip in Europe!

Hong Kong legal chief denies political motive in jailings as criticism mounts,"Student leaders Lester Shum, Nathan Law and Alex Chow hug as they arrive at the High Court to face verdict on charges relating to the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central protests, in Hong Kong, China August 17, 2017.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

Hong Kong’s legal chief denied any “political motive” in seeking jail for three young pro-democracy activists on Friday, responding to a Reuters report that he had overruled other legal officials who had initially advised against pursuing the case. An appeals court on Thursday jailed three leaders of the Chinese-ruled city’s democracy movement, Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 27, and Nathan Law, 24, for six to eight months, dealing a blow to a youth-led push for universal suffrage. Several protests by their supporters are planned in coming days.

They had been convicted of unlawful assembly related to months of mostly peaceful street protests that gripped the city in 2014 but failed to sway Communist Party rulers in Beijing in their call for full democracy. The trio had already been sentenced last year by a district court in the former British colony to non-jail terms including community service, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking jail terms.

Reuters reported that Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had ignored the advice of several senior prosecutors in the Department of Justice in pushing for jail terms. Yuen said differences of opinion could be constructive. “I believe everyone will understand that any entity, including a government department, in discussing something, will sometimes have a consensus, and sometimes there are different opinions,” he told reporters. “I hope everyone can understand that the main point is not whether there was any difference in opinion, and actually sometimes having a difference in opinion is a good thing, because if everyone has the same opinion then you can’t have a constructive discussion.”

Yuen added there “hasn’t been any political motive at all” in the case. China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said in response to the sentences that “no one can use the excuse of so-called democracy and freedom to carry out illegal violent acts”.

INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

But the sentencing has stoked broader international fears for Hong Kong’s constitutionally enshrined freedoms, part of a “one country, two systems” deal under which the British returned the territory to China in 1997, as well as perceptions of political meddling. Hong Kong enjoys a free, highly respected judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

“We are concerned by the decision of the Hong Kong authorities to seek a tougher sentence,” said Kristin Haworth, a spokesperson for the US Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau. “We hope Hong Kong’s law enforcement continues to reflect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and remains apolitical.”

US House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the re-sentencing of the trio “unjust”. “This injustice offends the basic notions of freedom and democracy and deserves the swift and unified condemnation of the international community,” she said in a statement.

US senator and once presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, together with representative Chris Smith, also criticized what they called the “shameful” sentencing. Their statement drew ire from the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s representative office in Hong Kong.

“We ask the US government to follow the basic principles of international relations, and oppose and stop the aforementioned congressmen’s speech and action that oppose China and stir up troubles in Hong Kong,” the office said in a statement. Britain said it was vital Hong Kong’s young people had a voice in politics and it hoped the sentencing would not discourage legitimate protest. The office of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen expressed “much regret” over the sentence.

China’s conservative state-run tabloid, the Global Times, welcomed the jail terms, saying “the law has shown its authority”. “This sentence will be a milestone in Hong Kong’s governance. From now on people who protest violently can be given a guilty sentence following this precedent, and they will need to go to jail,” the newspaper wrote.

The jail terms disqualify Wong, Chow and Law from running for the financial hub’s legislature for the next five years. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit. The three plan to appeal.

Voices of Partition: A Dhaka Hindu and a Kolkata Muslim recount what Independence meant to them,"Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo) Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo)

The Radcliffe Line cut through the heart of the subcontinent and was clearly the biggest cost of Independence. As the line cut through lives across India and the newly-created Pakistan, there emerged bone chilling accounts of deaths, violence and suffering from the North West and Eastern quarters of India.

However, there was a significant difference between the way Partition took place in Punjab and in Bengal. While the former represented a sudden cataclysmic division of territories, the latter was a long drawn slow process lasting even several years after independence.

Accordingly, the partition of Punjab was way bloodier than what its counterpart in the East witnessed. Though less dramatic, the partition of Bengal, however, was no less disturbing. Less about blood, the division of Bengal was more about displacement and the crisis of migration and property loss, that went on for the next several years.

An estimated 30 lakh Hindu refugees had entered West Bengal by 1960 as close to 7 lakh Muslims left for East Pakistan. The refugee influx in Bengal was also accompanied by the fact that the government was less prepared to rehabilitate them, resulting in huge housing and sanitation problems for the millions, most of whom were owners of large property back in East Bengal.

If the incoming Hindu population faced the bitterness of displacement on one hand, then the Muslims who stayed on in West Bengal were equally distraught. Overnight their homeland had turned unfamiliar with questions over their plans for leaving being raised too often as a reminder of their uneasy presence in India. While on one hand the political elite of the country unfurled the Tricolour, announcing to the world India’s achievement of freedom, what did independence mean to those in Bengal and Punjab, stuck in the aftermath of a line being drawn across their homeland? Here are two voices that help us get a sense of the insecurity and pain.

Basanti Roychowdhury: We never thought we would stay permanently

Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo) Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo)

“The word swadhin (independence) was something we barely understood. We just knew that Pakistan was getting formed and the Muslims would kill us,” says 85-year-old Basanti Roychowdhury as she reminisces over the days of horror she went through in her teens. A migrant from East Pakistan, Roychowdhury is currently residing with her son and his family in Kolkata. Daughter of a well-off zamindar in Dhaka (currently in Bangladesh), she recounts that for her, 1947 and the years preceding were all about the fear of Hindu-Muslim riots, her father’s hatred towards the nationalist leaders and the uncertainty about whether or not they would have to leave their palatial home.

“Our house was beside Buriganga river. It was a huge house. The surroundings were so beautiful. There was greenery all around. From the window in my bedroom, we could see paddy fields, all green around. There were barely any construction around. I could never imagine leaving Dhaka. My parents would come to Kolkata during vacations, but I hated going anywhere from Dhaka.

My father was a zamindar and we were more or less well off. The house was huge. I have been told you can still find it on Wikipedia. It was called Rooplal house.

When I was in my early teens one my brothers died out of typhoid. The grief of his death led to my mother falling very ill, and during this same time another brother of mine also caught typhoid. We were in fact planning on taking my brother and mother to Calcutta for his treatment. During this time, there were discussions of Pakistan being formed and a date being fixed. Everything was so uncertain, we were scared that we might have to leave our house. But my father was very hell bent that he won’t leave the house in Dhakha.

This was the time when Dhaka saw a large number of Hindu-Muslim riots. Ours was a Hindu locality so it was not that bad. But the Muslims would attack us frequently. We were very scared of Muslims and when they would attack. I have heard they had attacked our house once before I was born. This is why we had a large number of guards. I have heard that the Muslims had arrived at house in a bus, but before they could enter they had been pushed back. After that incident, they had never attacked the house.

I had once seen a large number of Muslims gathered on the other side of the river and crying slogans, about to attack us. I used to shiver with fear on hearing this cry. I was just 6-7 years old then and would start crying every time I heard them shout. The servants would pick me up and all my brothers would stand on guard on the stairs with guns in their hands.

On August 15, we were so scared all day because Pakistan was being formed. There was no happiness about anything at all. There was just fear. The Hindus were so scared as if we were getting finished now. There was no joy of the British leaving. There was just fear of Pakistan. Flag hoisting had taken place at night. I had seen the flag hoisted on my terrace on waking up. All the houses had flags hoisted. We had to hoist it, otherwise the government would suspect us of being anti-nationalist. We were very upset on seeing the flag. We were scared that we would be under the Muslims now.

My father was also very scared. Yet he did not want to leave. He felt that no one would know him in Calcutta. In Dhaka, he had the pride of being rich and well known and he did not want to leave that.

He used to hate Nehru and Gandhi. He was anyway pro-British, most zamindars were pro-British during those days. He used to hate all this rhetoric around the freedom struggle.

My elder brother on the other hand was very involved in the freedom struggle and was very anti-British. He was a student that time, doing his graduation in commerce. Alongside he would be secretly involved in nationalist politics. During that period, the younger generation was very stirred up to free the nation and my brother was also involved in it. He was arrested by the police once. My father had to somehow free him. My sister-in-law used to tell me that my brother used to get guns and arms and hide it under the bed. Generally the police would never suspect members of Zamindar families. But he was caught in a meeting once and got arrested.

We were in Dhaka during Partition and came to Calcutta in August 28 or 29. When we came here we never thought we were going to stay permanently. We had thought of going back after the treatment of my brother and mother. But once we came here people started pouring in heaps and bounds from East Bengal and so we decided to stay on.

When we first came to Calcutta, first of all there was the sadness of leaving our country. Then there was the grief of leaving that huge house and living in a small hut in Calcutta. The Calcutta house appeared like nothing more than a hut to us then. I missed the greenery of Dhaka and still miss it often.”

Dr. Hossainur Rahaman: Jinnah’s name could not be uttered in the house

“Muslims are expected to fast each year during the month of Ramzaan, but I have fasted only once in my life and that was on the day of Partition. Such was my grief at Bengal being divided,” remembers 83-year-old Dr Hossainur Rahaman who has been residing in Park Circus in central Kolkata for the past several decades. A retired Professor of History from Chandannagar college and belonging to a family of “old school Congress supporters”, Rahaman recounts how his majority Hindu locality turned into a Muslim habitation overnight during Partition and how his father was pressed about leaving India soon after.

“Growing up, we were five sisters and four brothers. Now I am left with one sister. My eldest sister, Dr. Anwara Khatoon was the first female Muslim doctor to have passed out from Calcutta Medical College. She was quite a well known name in Calcutta.

As a young boy, I never joined politics. But I was well known as a follower of Nehru and Bose. My family was very much old school Congress supporters. In my school days I had a library in my home which I named “Netaji library” and had works of Gandhi and other Congress leaders in it. On the other hand, my father was in ardent opposition to Jinnah. I remember once my brother had gone to see Jinnah giving a speech and when he came home my father gave him a harsh scolding. He made it very clear to my brother that Jinnah’s name will never be uttered in the house.

The area in which I grew up, only 2 or 3 houses were occupied by Muslims. Rest all were Hindus. I was close to just one Muslim family. We were very friendly with the Hindus and did not for once feel that they were different from us in anyway.

On August 15, I was in Parbatipur in present day Bangladesh. I had no idea at that moment about whatever was happening at home. I came back home 2-3 days later. I reached Sealdah station and took a bus from there towards Ballygunj. The bus was absolutely empty. When I was about to get down at Park Circus people around me started screaming. “Jaben na, Jaben na, eita Muslim para (Dont go here, this is a Muslim area)” I was quite surprised but I got off and went home. When I reached home everyone was surprised that I came all alone. When I went out later to meet my friends I was shocked to see that everyone had left and suddenly this area had become a Muslim locality.

I was aware of the announcement of Partition but not about the riots. Once I came back home I became aware of what all had taken place. There was a temple at Kareya road right behind my house. My father got news that Muslims were about to destroy the temple. My father immediately took out his rifle and warned everyone that he would shoot down anyone who would try to touch the temple. Hindus had stayed at our house for a long time as well to hide from the riots. Hindus never attacked our house because my sister was a very important person in Calcutta that time.

I have a significant memory of a relief camp in Brabourne College. My sister was the only lady doctor there and I went with her there. I used to wait outside while she tended to the patients all day long.

After the riots, my father was asked over and again if we would leave. But he decided to stay on. Despite the fact that my sister was offered a job at Dhaka college and one of my brothers was offered a position in the post commission at Karachi, we never for once thought of leaving India.

Terror funding probe: NIA arrests Kashmir businessman,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday arrested a prominent businessman from Kashmir, Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, in connection with the funding of terrorist and separatist organisations in Jammu and Kashmir. Watali was arrested in Delhi following several rounds of questioning.

Watali is suspected to be involved in hawala transactions using his vast network of contacts in India and Pakistan. He is also believed to be close to some high-ranking officials in Pakistan. Watali, according to NIA, acted as a conduit for illegally remitting funds to secessionists, terrorists and stone-pelters.

“His arrest follows the searches conducted by the NIA on August 16 at multiple locations in Srinagar, Handwara, Kupwara and Baramulla belonging to the relatives and employees of Watali,” said a statement from NIA. He will be produced before the Patiala House court on Friday.

According to the NIA, the searches have unearthed highly incriminating material pertaining to receipt of funds by Watali from foreign sources and its further distribution to the terrorists and separatists in Kashmir Valley for anti-India activities, said NIA.

The agency on June 3 had searched Watali’s house in Srinagar and seized documents pertaining to several financial transactions and land deals. The property documents seized have shown huge amount of cash transactions in sale and purchase, the agency said.

Watali was earlier arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 1990, when some anti-national activists were found to be present in his house at Bagat Barzulla in Srinagar. He was taken into custody with Yasin Malik, Sajjad Gani Lone, Bilal Lone and others, and was jailed for eight months in Jammu.

In 2009, Watali was accused of illegal encroachment of land and assault and a case was registered against him at Parimpora in Srinagar. However, as per the orders of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, the investigation of the case has been stayed.

Watali is also accused of travelling on a cancelled invalid passport despite having full knowledge of its being invalid. Instead of surrendering the cancelled passport to the authorities, he travelled abroad on invalid passport on March 21, 2016 in violation of the law and when he tried to do so again, his invalid passport was seized in Delhi, NIA said.

At present, the proceedings, in this case, are in abeyance as per the orders of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court.

Men find sexual assault as traumatising as women do: Research,"These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo) These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo)

Men are often looked at only as perpetrators of sexual assaults. But what happens to those men who become victims of such assaults? These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research.

Sexual assault is unwanted sexual contact — including rape — and is a traumatising event linked to numerous mental health consequences associated with negative outcomes such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear, anxiety, alcohol dependence, use of illicit substances, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide. While there is extensive research on the collateral consequences experienced by females, almost no research exists on how sexual violence affects adult, non-incarcerated males or how it affects them as compared to females.

The new findings, published in the journal Women & Criminal Justice, challenge a sociological theory that explains that men are more likely to respond to sexual assault with anger and by engaging in criminal activity, while women are more likely to respond with depression and sadness.

“When we began this study, we thought for sure that we would find that females who were sexually assaulted would exhibit higher depression scores than males who were sexually assaulted,” said lead researcher Lisa Dario, Assistant Professor at Florida Atlantic University in the US.

“I think this is probably because of antiquated ideas that men and women experience emotions differently. What we actually discovered, much to our surprise, is that sexual assault is traumatic regardless of gender,” Dario added. The study involved a sample size of 11,860 adults in the US — 5,922 men and 5,938 women — obtained from the National Violence Against Women Survey’s database.

The researchers found that all victims of sexual assault had higher depression scores than individuals who have had not experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.

Men make up about 38 percent of sexual assault and rape incidents reported, and those in the military are particularly vulnerable and more unlikely to report an assault, according to the US National Crime Victimisation Survey results. The researchers suspect that it is possible that men may even experience depression more than women because they do not have the social outlets and support systems available to women, and therefore may wind up internalising their feelings and emotions.

“There is no room for ‘sexism’ in sexual assault research [by ignoring male victims] and we must bring attention to an issue that impacts men equally, especially if we know that their negative emotional responses are treatable,” Dario said.

Barcelona acknowledges interest in Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele,"Liverpool’s American owners are not wavering in their stance on Philippe Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. (Source: Reuters) Liverpool’s American owners are not wavering in their stance on Philippe Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona is still after Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund forward Ousmane Dembele. Coutinho put in a transfer request last week, but Liverpool has said that he is not for sale after rejecting two offers for the Brazil international from Barcelona.

Dembele has been fined and suspended from team training by Dortmund, and is reportedly refused all contact with the club since Barcelona made a bid reported to be worth 105 million euros ($124 million), including add-ons.

“I recognize that they are two players that we really want to come, but their clubs are the ones who have to decide if we can make these signings”, Barcelona sporting director Robert Fernandez said Thursday.

Barcelona is trying to reinvest the 222 million euros ($262 million) it received from Paris Saint-Germain when the French club signed Brazil striker Neymar.

Liverpool’s American owners are not wavering in their stance on Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. “Nothing new,” Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said Thursday. “Nobody told me anything different.”

Coutinho will not be in the squad for Liverpool’s league match against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with the club saying he has a back injury.

So far, Barcelona has been limited to convincing Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande to part with Brazil midfielder Paulinho for 40 million euros ($47 million).

The 29-year-old Paulinho signed a four-year contract on Thursday, three days before Barcelona opens the Spanish league season against Real Betis.

Paulinho was considered a disappointment when he played for English club Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Guangzhou in 2015. He said at his presentation at Camp Nou that he had recovered his confidence in China.

“My first season in Tottenham was very good. In the second I couldn’t play consistently,” Paulinho said. “Perhaps it wasn’t my best season. Things didn’t go as I would have liked. But that is the past. I accepted the challenge of playing in China and I won back both my desire and confidence there.”

Paulinho will be tasked with strengthening a Barcelona midfield that took a step back last season, a decline that stopped it from defending its Spanish league title.

Macron tells Erdogan he wants detained journalist back in France,"French President Emmanuel Macron (REUTERS/Christian Hartmann) French President Emmanuel Macron (REUTERS/Christian Hartmann)

President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday expressed his concerns over a French journalism student detained in Turkey in a telephone call with Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, the Elysee Palace said. Loup Bureau was seized by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August after he was found to have photographs and interviews with Kurdish militia fighters among his possessions.

France has been trying to gain consular protection. Macron told Erdogan he wanted “that our compatriot be able to return to France as soon as possible,” according to the statement. The two leaders will discuss the matter again next week.

Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia to be an extension of the PKK, which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey and is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara, the United States and European Union. Macron and Erdogan also discussed the Syrian conflict. The French president reiterated his hopes to pursue a narrow-focused dialogue centred on the fight against terrorism and an inclusive political solution for peace and a unified Syria.

"Barcelona terror attack: 13 killed, several injured; Islamic State claims responsibility","An injured person is carried in Barcelona, Spain, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said.

(AP Photo/Oriol Duran)

A van on Thursday mowed through crowds of tourists on Barcelona’s Las Ramblas district, killing at least thirteen people, Reuters reported. The van had swerved off the sidewalk into an area near the Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist district of the city usually crowded with foreigners who frequent the bars and shops on the stretch of this historical market area.

“We can confirm there are 13 dead and more than 50 injured,” regional interior minister Joaquim Forn said on Twitter. Police confirmed the arrest of two men behind the incident, news agency AP said. One of the suspects was named by the police union as Driss Oukabir.

The attack was later claimed by Islamic State. Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Spanish region of Catalonia said that at least 80 people had been taken to hospital. According to a US monitor, the jihadist organisation’s propaganda outlet Amaq said, “The executors of the Barcelona attack were soldiers of the Islamic State.”

US President Donald Trump condemned the attack. He took to twitter and said that he will take necessary actions. He tweeted, “The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help.”

France’s President Emmanuel Macron called it a “tragic attack”. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter that London “stands with Spain against terror”.

News agency AFP quoted an eye witness saying, “There were bodies on the ground with people crowding round them. People were crying. There were lots of foreigners.” Another eye witness told Britain’s Sky News television, “All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids.”

Earlier, the Islamic State also claimed the Nice attack and also the 2015 Paris attack on the night club. Not only this, IS also claimed another deadly vehicle attack in December in which 12 people were killed when a man driving a truck ploughed into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.

A van drove into a crowd in a busy tourist district in Spain’s Barcelona city on Thursday taking the lives of 13 people and wounding over 100. The attack took place a little after 5 pm at Las Ramblas, a street popular with tourists and locals for its shops and bars, in the central part of the city. Police have labeled the attack as one carried out with intentions to spread terrorism and are on the lookout for the driver of the vehicle. The Islamic State terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Meanwhile, another incident in a similar fashion occurred in Cambrils, barely eight hours after the first one, in which an Audi A3 car charged into wayfarers. As many as seven people were hurt, one of whom is critical. The city is located 120 kilometers toward the south of Barcelona. Both cities are located in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Spanish police gunned down five people on Thursday suspected of carrying out the charge in Cambrils. The BBC reported Friday morning that one of them allegedly alighted from the car in an attempt to stab passersby.

The police had earlier hypothesized that the two events could be linked to one another and have confirmed the same now, according to latest reports. They have also established that the attackers had on belts with explosives attached.

Leaders across the globe have condemned the attack. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with the people of Spain and called the incident a “tragic attack”. US President Donald Trump condemned the attack and offered help to the Spanish government. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said, “My thoughts are with the victims of today’s terrible attack in Barcelona and the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident,” adding, “The UK stands with Spain against terror.” Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj confirmed that no Indians have been harmed in either of the strikes. The MEA is in constant communication with the Indian Embassy in Spain to keep tabs on the situation, she said.

India’s Akash Saharan finished a respectable sixth in the final round of the men’s trap event at the ISSF Junior Shotgun World Cup at Porpetto, Italy today.

Spain’s Adria Martinez won the gold with a world record score of 46 out of 50. Saharan made it to the six-man final round by finishing a commendable second out of 70 shooters. He had even got the better of Martinez in a three-way shoot-off to determine

qualifying positions for the final round.

In the final round, the Indian took an early joint-lead having shot four out of four, but then missed eight of the next 21 to settle for sixth place.

Martinez was involved in an intense battle for gold in the end with Italian Matteo Marongiu, who is a World Cup bronze medallist as well as a European Championship silver winner at the junior level, eventually prevailing 46-43.

Turkey’s Murat Ilbilgi won the bronze with a score of 36 in the finals. Saharan had earlier shot 114 out of 125 in the qualifying

round and had won a three-way shoot-off 11-10 to push the Italian Matteo Marongiu into the third qualifying spot. Martinez was first one out in the shoot-off.

Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier, Wang Yang, on Wednesday pledged full support to Nepal for the development and promotion of Ayurvedic medical system in the Himalayan nation which is rich in medicinal plants and herbs. Yang, who visited the National Ayurveda Research and Training Center situated in Kirtipur near Kathmandu assured to cooperate with Nepal to carry out further research in the sector of Ayurveda.

Health Secretary Kiran Regmi said the government was seeking to establish an Ayurveda Hospital in all seven provinces across the country in future, asking the Chinese side for help.

“Though Nepal is rich in medicinal plants and herbs, lack of skills and knowledge about their proper use has deprived Nepalis of reaping maximum benefits,” Regmi said, adding that the government was establishing herbs processing center equipped with high technology and a digital library for the promotion of Ayurveda.

The government of China had constructed a building for the center at a cost of Rs 680 million in 2009 and handed it to the Nepal Government in 2011.

Besides, the Chinese government also gifted medical equipments worth Rs 240 million. Surgery, gynaecology, maternity, cancer treatment, acupuncture, radiology and pathology services are available in the center.

Virat Kohli-led Indian team arrives in Dambulla for first ODI against Sri Lanka; see pics,"India will play their first ODI on Sunday in Dambulla. (Source: Twitter) India will play their first ODI on Sunday in Dambulla. (Source: Twitter)

After registering a thumping 3-0 Test series win over hosts Sri Lanka, it’s time to gear up for the five match ODI series, which will start on August 20 in Dambulla. As Team India arrived in Dambulla on Thursday for their first ODI, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a few pictures from their official Twitter handle of the Indian players, stepping out of the bus and being greeted by the locals.

The BCCI tweeted,”#TeamIndia members arrive for the 1st ODI vs. @OfficialSLC at Dambulla #SLvIND.”

Team India are all set to give a tough fight to Sri Lanka as they have a solid batting line-up with the likes of Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, which is enough to destroy any bowling attack in the world. The inexperience in the Sri Lankan camp can make it more difficult for the hosts to put up a challenging fight in the series.

Sri Lanka will be banking on their experienced lot including Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga and Thisara Perera. Also, Niroshan Dickwella’s impressive form with the bat is a good sign for the team. Lasith Malinga will be leading the Lankan bowling attack and he can prove to be really effective on his day.

India on the other hand, would be relying on their batting power and apart from that the fast bowling options with the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Hardik Pandya will play a huge role in shaping up the Indian bowling unit during the entire series.

Fatmata Kamara had just stepped outside her house before dawn yesterday when she saw the muddy hillside collapsing above her. The only thing she could do was run. She was one of the survivors, those who managed to escape the surging mudslides and floodwaters in and around Sierra Leone’s capital that killed more than 300 people, many of them trapped as they slept. Another 600 people are missing, the Red Cross said today, and the death toll is expected to rise.

Thousands lost their homes in the disaster, which was triggered by heavy rains. “I ran away from the house, leaving behind my family,” a grieving Kamara told The Associated Press. “I am the only one that has survived, as my house and dozens of others were covered with mud and boulders.”

Rescuers dug with their bare hands through the thick, reddish mud to try to find any survivors in the debris of the homes. Heavy equipment was later brought in, said government spokesman Cornelius Deveaux. The military also was deployed to help. Some bodies were swept into the sea off the coast of the West African nation and have begun washing back ashore.

The mortuary of the Connaught Hospital in central Freetown was overwhelmed with the dead. More than 300 bodies of men, women and children were brought there, and many were laid out on the floor. Deveaux said an exact death toll was unknown, and many of the bodies were horribly mangled. President Ernest Bai Koroma said Sierra Leone was in a state of grief and mourning, with many survivors still in shock.

Radio journalist Gibril Sesay said he lost his entire family. “I am yet to grasp that I survived, and my family is gone,” he said through sobs, unable to continue.

Ahmed Sesay, caretaker of a two-story house near the Guma Valley Dam east of the capital, said he was sleeping around 6 a.m. when he felt a vibration. “It was like an earthquake. I ran out of my quarters to the gate of the compound,” he said. “The ground shook and I had to stay outside the compound until daybreak.”

An estimated 9,000 people have been affected in some way by the disaster, said Abdul Nasir, program coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “I have never seen anything like it,” he said. “A river of mud came out of nowhere and swallowed entire communities, just wiped them away. We are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss.”

Charles Mambu, a civil society activist and resident of one affected area, Mount Sugar Loaf, said the magnitude of the destruction indicated that hundreds more people could be dead. In one sign of hope, two people were pulled alive from the debris yesterday evening, Mambu said. The UN said it is providing emergency response assistance.

Contingency plans are being put in place to try to stem the outbreak of diseases such as cholera, Deveaux told radio station FM 98.1. The bodies that have been recovered will begin to be buried in the next 48 hours, said Sulaiman Parker, environmental protection officer for the Freetown City Council.

Many of the poor areas of Freetown are near sea level and have poor drainage systems, which makes flooding worse during the rainy season. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction of large residential houses in hilltop areas.

Thousands of makeshift settlements in and around the city were severely affected. “The government has been warning people not to construct houses in these areas. When they do this, there are risks,” Nasir said. “People don’t follow the standard construction rules, and that is another reason that many of these houses have been affected.”

Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is one of the leading contributors to the flooding and mudslides.

Statue defaced as US Confederate monument protests grow after Charlottesville violence,"Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina. (Source: Reuters) Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina. (Source: Reuters)

A statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was defaced at North Carolina’s Duke University and there were more arrests on Thursday over the toppling of a similar statue as communities in the U.S. South faced a contentious debate over such divisive monuments. The discovery came as President Donald Trump stoked the controversy over the statues, echoing white nationalists by decrying the removal of what he said were “beautiful” monuments to the pro-slavery Confederacy.

The statue of Lee at the Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, was found early on Thursday with its nose and other facial features chipped off, the university said in a statement. Lee led the Confederate Army during the American Civil War.

The university said that surveillance camera footage was being reviewed for clues as to who was behind the attack on the statue, which stands by the chapel entrance. Security around the site is also being stepped up. A fresh debate over Confederate symbols has roiled the United States since Saturday’s violence during a protest by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, against the removal of a Lee statue in which one woman died.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer is due to make an announcement on Friday about the statue, public safety at future events, and the legacy of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who was killed, Signer’s office said in a statement. Also in Durham, four people surrendered on Thursday to face rioting and other charges stemming from the toppling of a statue of a Confederate soldier by protesters there, the Durham County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. That brought the number arrested in connection with Monday’s toppling to eight.

More than 100 people meanwhile staged a peaceful demonstration at the local courthouse, the sheriff’s office said. Many of them claimed they were involved in Monday’s action and demanded to be arrested too, according to local news reports and footage posted on social media.

“Deputies did not arrest rally participants who approached them claiming responsibility for the destruction of a historical statue,” the sheriff’s office said in its statement. In Helena, Montana, the city council voted on Wednesday to remove a Confederate fountain from a park. Democratic Governor Steve Bullock said the decision marked the removal of the last monument to the Confederacy in the northwest Rocky Mountains.

San Diego city officials on Wednesday also removed a plaque to Confederate President Jefferson Davis from a downtown plaza, local media said. In Arizona, tar and feathers coated a monument for the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, about 40 miles east of Phoenix, local TV news footage showed.

English Premier League managers back transfer window change,"The English Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier. (Source: AP) The English Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier. (Source: AP)

Premier League clubs will vote next month on a proposal to ensure the transfer window closes before the season starts, with the plan already winning the backing of several managers.

A vote will take place at the Premier League shareholders meeting on September 7 and clubs from the lower divisions in the English Football League are set to follow suit next month.

Currently, the window closes on the last day of August but the Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche said the current system can seriously disrupt the work of a manager and his team. “You don’t want to start the season and lose three of your players when you’re three games into the season. That could be really hard to take. And that happens,” he said.

“So I think if you could get that done as well, it means that once the football starts, the managers, coaches and teams can just get on with the football.

“And the fans. They can just get on with what they really want to be looking at, and that is football matches.” Last week, Burnley sold striker Andre Gray to Watford three days before their opening game.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, Swansea boss Paul Clement and Stoke’s Mark Hughes are among those who have backed a change. “From a manager’s point of view, I would be in favour of the window closing before the season starts because of the disruption it causes,” Hughes said on Friday.

West Ham United’s Croatian manager Slaven Bilic supports the idea but has highlighted one potential pitfall to a change — the risk of a different window deadline from European leagues.

“For me it has to be across the leagues. Otherwise, there is no point,” he said. “Ironically, it would put the clubs in a worse situation that you would still lose players if clubs abroad want them and you can’t replace them. It would only protect us in that no other Premier League clubs can take your players.

“The (Philippe) Coutinho situation, it would not stop Liverpool losing him but would stop them finding a replacement. It’s a great idea, first one I’m definitely like ‘yes’. Some teams are losing like 30 percent of their teams.”

New Zealand’s Daniel Pearce takes one-shot lead in Fiji,"Daniel Pearce roared up the leaderboard with a scintillating start on his back nine to card a six-under 66 for a one-shot lead.

New Zealand’s Daniel Pearce roared up the leaderboard with a scintillating start on his back nine to card a six-under 66 for a one-shot lead after the first round of the Fiji International on Thursday.

Pearce, who started his round on the 10th hole, eagled the par-five first before making three birdies in succession at the seaside Natadola Bay Golf Course.

New Zealander Ben Campbell and Australia’s Daniel Valente both mounted late charges to finish one behind in joint second, with Malaysia’s Gavin Green a shot further adrift with a clutch of Australians at the European Tour event, which is co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia and Asian Tour.

Local favourite Vijay Singh was five back on one-under, the former world number one and triple major champion carrying an elbow injury through a typically windy day at Sigatoka.

“Before the round started if you told me I’d take one-under, I would because it was supposed to be pretty breezy,” Singh told reporters. “I was suspect to play. It’s really bugging me (when) I get to the top of my back-swing, so I had to shorten my back-swing to play,” he said of the elbow problem.

“But considering I was hurting that bad, I played OK.” Twice major champion Angel Cabrera faltered with three bogeys in his last five holes to finish with an even-par 72, along with fellow U.S. Masters winner Mike Weir.

Charlottesville violence: Donald Trump lashes out at senator on controversial remarks,"President Donald Trump President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump lashed out at fellow Republican Lindsey Graham on Thursday after the South Carolina senator criticised his response to last weekend’s deadly violence in Charlottesville.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists…and people like Ms. Heyer,” Trump said on Twitter.

Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd protesting the far-right march. “Such a disgusting lie,” Trump continued. “He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!” Trump appeared to be referring to his defeat of Graham in last year’s presidential primary.

In an early morning flurry, Trump again sought to cast himself as a victim of unfair press coverage of his remarks. “The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!,” the US president added.

Graham had said the US president “took a step backward” Tuesday “by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally” and people like Heyer.

Clashes broke out between far-right demonstrators and counter-protesters in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville Saturday. Members of organised neo-Nazi and so-called “Alt-Right” groups had called a rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue there.

Both Democrat and Republican politicians criticised Trump’s initial response — when he condemned violence “on all sides” — as inadequate. After a press conference on Monday in which he singled out the Klu Klux and neo-Nazis as “repugant”, he appeared to move back to his previous position the following day. He once again said there had been “blame on both sides”, setting off a political firestorm.

As the crisis unfolded, senior business executives began dropping out of the White House economic advisory councils to the point that Trump on Wednesday announced he was scrapping them. World leaders have also criticized what they see as a lack of firmness on the issue that could open more space to the far-right in the United States.

Today is the last day for White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, a presidential spokesperson said today. The announcement came amid reports that Bannon has been fired by US President Donald Trump.

“White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve’s last day,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

“We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,” Sanders said, thus bringing down the curtains on Bannon, known for his right-wing views, who played a key role in electoral victory of Trump last year.

With this, Bannon became the third high-profile White House official to have been fired in recent weeks. The other two being the White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer.

The White House announcement comes three days after Trump said of Bannon, “I like him, he’s a good man”. He also said that press treats him “very unfairly”.

US Vice President Mike Pence urges Latin American nations to isolate North Korea,"Vice President Mike Pence (Source: AP Photo/File) Vice President Mike Pence (Source: AP Photo/File)

US Vice President Mike Pence urged Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Mexico to break ties with North Korea on Wednesday, adding that “all options” are on the table with regards to the Asian state. “The US places great importance on the ongoing diplomatic isolation of the Kim regime and we strongly urge Chile today, and we urge Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties to North Korea,” Pence said during a visit to Chile in a joint news conference with Chile’s President Michelle Bachelet.

US President Donald Trump warned North Korea last week it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States, prompting North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the Pacific island of Guam. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.

The governments of countries Pence mentioned mostly said they did not have immediate plans to break off ties. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia. “Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,” a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.

Peru’s Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference the country had not been formally asked to break ties by the United States and would evaluate the issue at the right time. Lima, which has condemned North Korea’s missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.

The Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy. Trade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.

Brazil, the region’s largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports – mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather – and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.

Last year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.

Chile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence. “I’ve requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,” he said.

Pence said he would “especially welcome” Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world’s leading wine exporter outside of Europe.

Neighboring Argentina, Latin America’s No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. The leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.

Pence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation. “Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea’s provocations,” he said.

Pence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America “should do more” on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April. Trump’s comments last week that a “military option” was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.

“Chile will not support coups or military intervention,” said Bachelet at the news conference. “In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.” Pence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip “a little bit early” on Thursday after visiting Panama.

"West Bromwich Albion have rejected bid for defender Jonny Evans, says Tony Pulis","Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Manchester City. (Source: File) Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Manchester City. (Source: File)

West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Premier League rivals Manchester City, but stopped short of completely ruling out a move away from the Hawthorns for the centre-back.

Pulis told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s Premier League trip to Burnley that Evans, who is out with a hamstring injury, would not be sold unless an “enormous” offer was made.

“We’ve turned down an offer for Jonny,” Pulis said on Friday. “Every player is for sale at the right price. “It is absolutely crazy to say a team like West Brom won’t sell players if people weren’t going to put an enormous amount of money in front of you.

“Firstly, we don’t want to sell him, we don’t need to sell him. So we’re not desperate to get the money. It would have to be a very, very good offer.”

Pulis also dismissed reports that Tottenham Hotspur defender Kevin Wimmer was close to completing a switch to West Brom. “Whoever’s telling you we are close is miles away from that fact. We have a lot of irons in the fire with a lot of targets,” Pulis said.

West Brom centre-back Gareth McAuley and midfielder James Morrison are also ruled out of the trip to Burnley as they are recovering from thigh and knee injuries, respectively.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Mahendra Rajput’s super raid saves Gujarat Fortunegiants from home loss,"With 54 raid points, Sachin Tawar is the leading scorer for Gujarat Fortunegiants. (Source: AP) With 54 raid points, Sachin Tawar is the leading scorer for Gujarat Fortunegiants. (Source: AP)

When Mahendra Ganesh Rajput was sent to make a raid in the 37th minute of the game, instructions from coach Manpreet Singh were clear as he wanted his trump player to inflict an all-out on Bengal Warriors. What followed next was sheer brilliance from the 27-year old raider as Gujarat Fortunegiants were awarded five points and avoided their first defeat at home. Mahinder’s prodigy helped Fortunegiants continue their unbeaten streak as the match ended in a thrilling 26-26 draw.

While Sachin Tawar and captain Sukesh Hegde imposed most of the damage on the Warriors, it was only Mahendra’s effective last two raids that gave the hosts a lead of 26-23. One can clearly see that the team is doing well in Manpreet Singh’s aggressive style of play. “Bolke aaya tha Mahendra ko ki chahe kisi bhi bhagwan ko yaad karle but agli raid mein kamse kam teen point chaiye,” Manpreet said. “You want your best players to start the game for you but there is one player who comes in just to finish the game. Mahendra is one of them.”

During the post match presser, Benhal coach Jagdish Kumble said that they had studied every player’s move and had prepared a strategy accordingly. To a certain extent, Warriors were phenomenal in all the departments as they maintained their lead over their opponent.

After going into the half time with a 14-10 lead, Bengal raiders did well to keep an advantage over the Gujarat team. Jang Kun Lee, Maninder Singh and Deepak Narwal kept the scoreboard moving as Gujarat’s defence lacked the power to hold on Warriors brigade. Gujarat’s only stand out defender was Abozar Mighani while others failed to even open their account. With Deepak leading the charge, Bengal took a lead of 19-15 in the 32nd minute as they edged closer to registering their third win.

However, with the result, Gujarat is so far the only side to stay unbeaten at home in the fifth season of Pro Kabaddi. With next the leg to be played in Lucknow, the Fortunegiants coach said, “I challenge other teams to play like us and stay unbeaten at home.”

This was the fifth instance in this edition where teams have settled for a draw. The current situation of Zone A points table sees Gujarat Fortunegiants on 36 points, in the first place, while Bengal Warriors placed fourth in Zone B with 14 points after five matches.

Gorakhpur hospital tragedy: Govt panel recommends stock audit at BRD medical college,"A total of 72 children have died since August 7. Vishal Srivastav A total of 72 children have died since August 7. Vishal Srivastav

A COMMITTEE set up by the UP government to inquire into reports of shortage of liquid oxygen at Gorakhpur-based BRD Medical College and Hospital, allegedly leading to the deaths of over 60 children, has recommended proper “audit” of the stocks maintained at the paediatric department, prima facie suspecting “financial anomalies”.

The five-member team, comprising district officials and the chief medical officer, is headed by Gorakhpur Additional Commissioner (Administration) Sanjay Singh.

“First of all, we found lack of coordination among doctors, who were looking after administration work as well. No one can claim that they did not have information about the warnings giving by the liquid oxygen supplier, as letters sent by it were marked by the department head to the medical college principal. But he went on leave without finding a solution to the problem, despite knowing the sensitivity of the issue,” Singh told The Indian Express.

“The lack of coordination was also reflected in the fact that Dr Satish Kumar, head of anesthesia — responsible for ensuring uninterrupted supply of liquid oxygen — went on leave without proper permission at a time when the shortage was being faced,” he added.

The committee has allegedly found that while a “log book” of oxygen cylinders was started on August 10, a “stock book” — mentioning how many cylinders are in stock — had overwriting in several places. Following this, it prima facie suspected “financial anomaly” and recommended “audit” of the entire stock.

Further, the report held Satish Kumar, along with at least three accountants, prima facie guilty of not “fulfilling their duties”. It also held Chief Medical Superintendent Rama Shankar Shukla, HoD of Paediatric Department Mahima Mittal and nodal officer of ward 100, Kafeel Ahmed Khan, guilty of lack of coordination.

While the hospital administration has been found guilty of not clearing payment to the liquid oxygen supplier despite having budget for the same, the report concluded that Pushpa Sales Private Limited should not have stopped the oxygen supply considering “the life-saving nature” of its work, said sources.

Moreover, the committee has reportedly found that while Satish Kumar and chief pharmacist G Jaiswal were responsible for maintaining a “stock book” of cylinders, records were not maintained properly.

Moreover, Principal Rajeev Mishra was out of the district headquarters on August 10 and Satish Kumar went to Mumbai on August 11 without providing any prior written information on the day the oxygen shortage was reported. The report has found both officials guilty of leaving the hospital and district headquarters without finding solution to the problem.

Meanwhile, PTI reported that one more child died at the hospital on Thursday, raising the number of deaths to 72 since August 7. The deceased was admitted in the encephalitis ward of the medical college.

"Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon film works in fits and starts","Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast. Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast.

Bareilly Ki Barfi star cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Seema Tripathi

Bareilly Ki Barfi director: Ashwini Iyer Tiwari

Bareilly Ki Barfi rating: 2.5 stars

‘Bareilly ke bazaar mein barfi giri re’. Clearly, the film was made keeping the iconic song in mind, except with an alliterative ‘barfi’ not a ‘jhumka’ in mind.

This Small-Town Rom Com ticks all the boxes going in: perky girl armed with requisite quirky parents, a couple of suitable boys, and great one liners. And it does work in fits and starts, but it flattens equally in between. The thing with dreaming up smart lines, and there are some quite wonderfully flavoursome ones in here, is that sometimes entire scenes get written just to be able to include the punch-lines: this ‘mithai’ has several such sequences, and make the run-time flabby.

One fine day, Bitti Mishra (Sanon) pronounced, quite properly Misra, by the ‘h’ dropping Bareilly-walas, sets her heart on meeting a mysterious someone who seems to know her inside out. Local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana) is smitten. And then arrives a guy who goes by the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) who is the fly in the ointment. Or is he? Will the new entrant surge ahead? Who will win the fair maiden?

Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast: Tripathi, who’s much too young to play the leading lady’s father, does a good job of being Bitti’s papa, who’s more like a pal than a pa. Pahwa scores another ace after Aankhon Dekhi: what a lovely actress she is.

The two actors who play the best friends, one who accompanies Khurrana, and the other who is seen with Sanon, are pitch perfect. They show up the problems that Sanon has with merging into her part: she tries hard to the be the small-town girl who likes a couple of puffs on the side, and who break dances for fun, but the effort shows.

The plot’s contrivances come in the way of Khurrana’s playing of Chirag fully credibly. As does Rajkummar Rao, who blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid ‘chota shehari’ on the one hand, and the loud ‘rangbaaz’ on the other.

Rao sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it. Almost.

Trump to discuss South Asia strategy with top aides,"In this Aug. 14, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump pauses while speaking in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington.

President Donald Trump is set to discuss with his national security team the US’ strategy in South Asia, including developing a new regional policy for resolving the long-running conflict in Afghanistan that may include both India and Pakistan. Trump will meet the team tomorrow at Camp David, a picturesque presidential retreat in Maryland, nearly 100 kms from Washington DC.

US National Security Advisor Lt Gen H R McMaster would be among those attending the meeting, the White House said. “The President along with the Vice President will meet with the National Security Team on Friday at Camp David to discuss the South Asia strategy,” it said.

The South Asia strategy primarily means the policy in Afghanistan, but the Trump administration feels that the war-torn country needs a regional approach to resolve the decades old problem.

In the past few weeks, senior officials of the Trump administration have gone on record to say that the regional approach to Afghanistan means inclusion of both India and Pakistan.

However, the officials so far have remained tight-lipped on what this means for India given that Pakistan has been averse to any Indian role in Afghanistan.

During the Bush administration and the initial years of the Obama administration, Pakistan had successfully managed to keep India out of major strategic conferences on Afghanistan. However, the successive administrations in the US have acknowledged the role of India in the development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. After the US, India is one of the largest donors for developmental projects in Afghanistan.

Hopefully Mark Stoneman will take his opportunity in the first Test: Joe Root,"Mark stoneman will open the batting for england along with Alaistair Cook. Mark stoneman will open the batting for england along with Alaistair Cook.

England captain Joe Root has called upon opener Mark Stoneman to grab his chance and prove his mettle as an opening batsman during the three match Test series against West Indies.

Speaking to sky sports, Root said, “He’s obviously got a huge amount of runs under his belt this year, in particular, and in previous seasons as well. He’s got a well-rounded game, he’s a bit more experienced having played a lot of county cricket and I’m excited to see him go and hopefully take his opportunity.”

He further added, Ideally you want some to come in and set the world alight and their career moves forward from there. But I’d like to think Stoneman will get a very good opportunity and some good game time with England. This is just a great opportunity for Mark to go out and show everyone how good a player he is.”

England has had a troubled time in finding a settled opening combination. Commenting on it, Root said, “Of course you want [the top order] to be settled,” said Root. “You never want to go into a series with guys out of form or under pressure but I think that is one of the challenges of Test cricket. And, as a side, generally, we’ve responded quite well to that in the past.”

Meanwhile, with the day-night Test set to begin from Thursday, Root believes it is a chance for everyone in his team to get an experience.

“I think it is a great opportunity for the rest of the guys to experience a pink-ball Test match for the first time and I’m really excited to get the week going. I think there are different challenges that [the pink ball] brings and at different times of the day than you’d normally expect in Test cricket., Root said and added, “But, ultimately, it is still the same fundamentals of cricket and you’ve just got to make sure that when those difficult periods crop up that we respond well and quickly. I think it’s great that we’re giving [day-night Test cricket] the opportunity to work here, I’m sure it’ll be a very exciting spectacle. It’ll be interesting to see how this week pans out.”

"US, Japan vow to boost defence cooperation with India, South Korea, Australia","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shakes hands with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, Thursday, August 17, 2017, after a news conference at the State Department in Washington.

The US and Japan have agreed to advance their multilateral security and defence cooperation with countries like India, South Korea and Australia, amidst China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region. “We will cooperate to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and other southeast Asian countries,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a news conference here with Defence Secretary James Mattis.

The news conference was also jointly addressed by Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera. “(With) ROK (South Korea), Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries, we will promote more than ever before cooperation in security and defence,” Kono said in Japanese which was translated into English. The four top officials were interacting with reporters after the newly launched US-Japan two plus two dialogue.

During the meeting held yesterday at the headquarters of the State Department, the four leaders among other issues discussed the increasing challenge posed by China in the region and the need to enhance multilateral cooperation with other countries, including India, in the region. “The ministers highlighted ongoing Alliance efforts to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries,” a joint statement issued after the meeting said.

“The ministers underscored the importance of cooperating to promote a rules-based international order, taking note of the United States’ continued commitment to maintain a strong presence in the region and Japan’s initiatives demonstrated by its ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’,” the statement said.

According to the joint statement, the ministers strongly encourage China to take decisive measures to urge North Korea to change its course of action. Expressing continuing concerns about the security environment in the East China Sea, they reaffirmed the importance of working together to safeguard the peace and stability of the East China Sea.

Expressing serious concern about the situation in the South China Sea, they reaffirmed their opposition to unilateral coercive actions by claimants, including the reclamation and militarisation of disputed features, that alter the status quo and increase tensions.

Reiterating the importance of the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes through full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, including arbitration, they emphasised the importance of compliance with the international law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including respect for freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. “The Ministers underlined the significance of continued engagement in the South China Sea, including through respective activities to support freedom of navigation, bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and coordinated capacity building assistance,” the statement said.

Tillerson said they discussed their concern about the security environment in the East China Sea and South China Sea. “The United States and Japan oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands, and we reaffirmed that Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty covers these islands. We also oppose militarisation activity in the South China Sea,” he said.

“Maritime disputes should be settled peacefully and maintain the freedom of navigation in accordance with the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. We maintain our unwavering commitment to the 2015 guidelines for US-Japan defence cooperation, and we have instructed our staff to accelerate their implementation,” he said.

Kono echoed Tillerson’s views, saying, Japan shared its concerns regarding the situation surrounding East and South China Sea. “We reaffirmed that the Senkaku Islands are within the scope of Article 5 of the Japan-US Security Treaty, and that we would oppose any unilateral behaviour attempting to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands,” he said.

“For the peace and stability of East Asia and East China Sea, we will continue to cooperate with the United States. On the South China Sea, we have confirmed that we need to continue to engage ourselves and watch for any acts which would impede freedom of navigation,” Kono said.

“Under this severe security environment, under all situations, the alliance must secure seamless response, and it’s extremely important. And we agreed that we would properly examine ways to strengthen the alliance,” he said.

Real Madrid starts title defense way ahead of Barcelona,"Real Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna. (Source: Reuters) Real Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna. (Source: Reuters)

It’s been a long, long time since Real Madrid felt this good going into the Spanish league season. Madrid displaced Barcelona as the top team in Spain last season by winning the title for the first time in five years. It also successfully defended its Champions League title to complete its first league-European Cup double since 1958.

Add to that this week’s win over a Barcelona team that has been hard hit by the exit of Brazil striker Neymar, and Madrid is bursting with confidence before Sunday’s league opener at Deportivo La Coruna.

Madrid dominated Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate to win the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday, only eight days after dispensing with Manchester United 2-1 in the European Super Cup.

Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, however, is trying to keep his players focused on the long haul toward next spring. “There won’t be any euphoria because we know this will be long,” Zidane said after Madrid’s 2-0 win over Barcelona in the second leg. “This team is hungry and we will try to keep this going. We know that it will not be easy, but we are prepared to accept the challenge.”

Easily lost in the glitter from all the trophies is Zidane’s achievement of crafting a squad that is dangerous no matter who plays. That depth was on full display in the curtain-raising super cups, when Madrid outclassed its rival powerhouses with very little help from Cristiano Ronaldo.

Still regaining his peak fitness, Ronaldo was a second-half substitute against United and in the first leg against Barcelona, when he scored a goal before being sent off.

Marco Asensio, a 21-year-old forward, is also one to watch after his goals from distance against Barcelona. Midfielders Francisco “Isco” Alarcon and Casemiro excelled against United with each scoring, and Madrid has signed young reinforcements Theo Hernandez, Dani Ceballos and Jesus Vallejo to cover the exits of Alvaro Morata, James Rodriguez, and Pepe.

The emergence of Asensio and Isco has even put into question the role of Gareth Bale, who didn’t play Wednesday. “I have a spectacular squad. You don’t notice the changes (to the starting 11),” Zidane said. “We can swap three or four players (in the lineup) and the team doesn’t change. I won’t say we play better, but we still play well, so we are satisfied.”

The extra options will serve Madrid well as it starts the league without Ronaldo, who is suspended for four matches after pushing the referee following his sending off at Camp Nou. As Madrid has gotten stronger, its challengers have gotten weaker.

Barcelona has been severely hampered by the exit of Neymar, who left for Paris Saint-Germain after its Qatari owners paid the record sum of 222 million euros ($262 million) to trigger his release clause.

That has left Lionel Messi without his favorite partner, and the club is struggling to spend its extra cash on players who can shore up a squad that is clearly a step or two behind Madrid. So far, the only post-Neymar signing is Paulinho, a midfielder.

“We have to bounce back soon because the league is starting,” Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said, looking ahead to Sunday’s home match against Real Betis. “We have to focus on the league ahead and keep going forward because that’s all we have.”

Atletico Madrid, which has finished third for three straight years since winning the title in 2014, can’t sign new players until January because it broke FIFA rules regarding youth players.

So the club coached by Diego Simeone is a retread of the one that relied on 33-year-old Fernando Torres and an uninspiring Kevin Gameiro to help Antoine Griezmann get goals.

Besides a new coach in Eduardo Berizzo, Sevilla is facing life after the departure of Ramon “Monchi” Rodriguez, its longtime sports director who took his talent-hunting skills to AS Roma. Forwards Manuel “Nolito” Agudo and homegrown fan favorite Jesus Navas have arrived from Manchester City, but Spain forward Victor “Vitolo” Machin will play at Las Palmas before he joins Atletico in 2018.

Villarreal could be a team to watch. Carlos Bacca has come on loan from AC Milan to replace Roberto Soldado as the team looks to break into the top-four spots and the Champions League berths.

Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao, two Basque Country clubs, should again challenge for fifth- and sixth-place finishes and a Europa League spot, while Valencia hopes to end years of mediocrity under new coach Marcelino Garcia.

Levante and Getafe are back after one season in the second division. They are joined by Girona, a feeder club for Man City that is making its debut in the top division.

Two plus two,"The 2+2 format draws on a framework Japan used for its strategic interactions with the US, France, Russia and Australia. The 2+2 format draws on a framework Japan used for its strategic interactions with the US, France, Russia and Australia.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump have moved to insulate the India-US strategic relationship from feuds over trade by instituting a new level of interaction between the principal actors, the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries. In both countries, diplomats hope the mechanism will place the strategic and security relationship between the two countries on centrestage, allowing common challenges — like the crisis spawned by China’s aggression on its peripheries, or challenges to energy security from instability in West Asia — to be addressed irrespective of differences on trade issues. The mechanism — called a 2+2 format — was discussed and agreed upon by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her counterpart, Rex Tillerson, on Tuesday.

The 2+2 format draws on a framework Japan used for its strategic interactions with the US, France, Russia and Australia. From 2010, India and Japan began direct interactions between their foreign and defence secretaries; this was raised to the level of the respective ministers in 2014. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is believed to have begun discussing the idea with his counterpart, General H.R. McMaster, soon after President Trump took office, in an effort to give depth to India-US strategic ties. There is little doubt that 2+2 will provide a powerful new vehicle to discuss issues. But bureaucracies in both countries need to resist being seduced by the idea that process alone can resolve the issues in the relationship.

There are now over 60 India-US bilateral institutions — but there is also mounting ire in Washington DC over what it sees as New Delhi’s chronic failure to use them to their potential. The causes are manifold: Bureaucratic inertia, legal issues, suspicions of US motives, lack of clarity on what India seeks from the strategic relationship. Perhaps more importantly, the existence of a dialogue mechanism will not itself insulate the strategic relationship from the fallout of simmering rows over intellectual property rights and trade — issues President Trump is likely to pursue — unless political leaders are clear on the ends they seek. Prime Minister Modi has gone some distance in meeting President Trump’s concerns, moving forward rapidly on importing shale oil from the US in an effort to narrow the trade deficit. However, there is a deeper problem: The White House’s lack of a clear vision for Asia, and of the US role in it, will dog the India-US relationship, just as it has the superpower’s ties to its other allies in Asia. This problem is one only determined political leadership can resolve, not yet another mechanism.

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman orders Qatar border be reopened to Mecca pilgrims: Reports,"Muslim pilgrims prepare themselves for Friday prayers in front of the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty) Muslim pilgrims prepare themselves for Friday prayers in front of the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty)

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered that the border with Qatar be reopened to allow pilgrims to carry out their annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, official state media said today. The decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5.

The border decision came after the kingdom’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency. The king has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed “to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,” it said. He even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport “to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses”.

The crown prince emphasised the “historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar”, the statement added.

Qatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims’ safety. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting “terrorists” and of being too close to Iran.

Qatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy. The tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 per cent of them foreigners, ranks as the world’s richest on a per-capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund. It holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.

"Infrastructural incompetence, decades of geographical alienation stymies cricket in Jaffna","The St Patrick’s College ground in Jaffna has the only turf wicket in the entire northern province. (Express Photo by Sandip G) The St Patrick’s College ground in Jaffna has the only turf wicket in the entire northern province. (Express Photo by Sandip G)

In a ramshackle asbestos chamber, stacked with broken boards and rusted chairs, an elderly sentinel of Jaffna’s St Patrick’s College Ground struggles to keep himself awake. His periodic post-lunch naps are intervened by the strident barks of a pack of strays, housed in a crumbling shed that hugs the ground under a hunched palmyra tree. He swishes his wooden stick in thin air and pelts a few craggy stones from his pocket. The dogs splinter astray.

His sleepy eyes then bumble on a skinny cow grazing into the centre of the ground. He nonchalantly walks up to it, pulls it by the rope on the neck and ties it to the pole of a goalpost, before returning to the chamber and washing his eyes with water to be more vigilant of intruders. “Vacation time ana ithu than tholla (in vacation time this is the biggest menace),” he mutters.

Schools in Sri Lanka are shut in August, the longest vacation of their academic year. The otherwise brimming ground is an eerily empty place. Thangavelu dreads the month, for he has to guard the ground from dogs and cows and “poruki pasanga” (rascals guys) who aim to turn the ground into a midnight watering hole. Not long ago, he used to vacation the month at home, but not after the college installed a turf wicket, the only such facility in the northern province, which comprises five districts and spans nearly 9,000 square kilometers.

It was readied by the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, three years ago, to facilitate the growth of cricket in the once strife-torn Jaffna peninsula.

The school, though, has to maintain the surroundings, and recently it got a roofed stand and a small gallery, which are packed during local derbies.

The turf wicket has stirred envy among other local schools, especially affluent ones like St John’s and Jaffna Hindu College, but on it dwells the biggest hope of the northern province producing its first ever international cricketer. At the peak of the war, it would have been blasphemous to even suggest this, but now the uneasiness has abated and sporting dreams have begun to sprout. And it’s all centred on the 22-yard strip of one of the oldest colleges in the country, founded by an Italian missionary. “We nurture it like a baby, because we know how precious it is and how lucky we are to have this facility. So we have to make the best use of it,” says Amaldas Nishanthan, the physical education teacher, who was a household name in his time, though he keeps asserting he played only on matting wickets. As if it’s some kind of slight.

Back in his time, in the mid-90s, when peace was delusional on the peninsula, Nishanthan says nobody knew turf wickets existed. “Only if we could go out of Jaffna could we see the turf wickets, which we couldn’t. It was in the early 2000s, when truce talks were underway and the roads reopened, that I first went out of Jaffna. But then the war was back again and the roads (doors) were shut,” he recollects.

The civil war hardly affected their provincial cricket, but it stalled the ambitions. “Those days we couldn’t even dream of dreaming about playing for Sri Lanka. We would have been branded traitors for sure even if we did, but then we were content that we could play cricket at least among the districts. It was a big relief for us. At least there was some peace and joy in our lives,” he says.

So all his life, Nishanthan, a prolific wicketkeeper-batsman, played his cricket on matting surfaces, with its moody bounce and whimsical disposition. But it made him a fine player square of the wicket. “I could cut, pull, and hook without any inhibitions. Also, keeping on such wickets sharpened my reflexes,” he says, his otherwise inexpressive face suddenly radiating with a puerile joy.

His fame traversed beyond the Elephant Pass and a bunch of visiting Sri Lankan cricket administrators were so impressed that they even chalked out a plan to smuggle him out of Jaffna though the Jaffna-Trincomalee-Colombo cargo route. He laughs wistfully, before admitting self-deprecatingly, that he was not brave enough. “I didn’t have the courage and getting out of Jaffna was risky and complicated,” he says.

He had to evade the eyes of LTTE cadets, the Sri Lankan Navy and the Army. More agonisingly, he had to stay away from his family, which, in those uncertain times, was mentally torturous. “You don’t know what will happen to them, and you don’t know whether you can even come back,” he says.

But Nishanthan and his friends used to impatiently wait for the cargo boats to dock at Trincomalee harbour, which, among other supplies, used to bring cricket goods. “We had to order the goods and pay three times the money. But that was one of the few things we could look forward to in our lives,” he says.

Even if he had managed to sneak into Colombo, there was no guarantee that he would prosper. “The cricketers there were and still are a few notches above us in terms of confidence, support, and the game. Being a good player on matting wicket doesn’t automatically make you a great player on turf,” he points out.

After the ambush of 2009, when the entire LTTE cadre was annihilated through a brutally clinical operation, and peace restored, a few youngsters like wicketkeeper-batsman Rishan Tudor, left-arm spinner G Gokulan and medium pacer Edward Edin did make it to Colombo.

But they found the gulf too huge to bridge and are still playing third-division cricket. “Rishan was a Patrician and is a talented boy, but the competition there’s so immense that climbing up the ladder is really difficult. Let’s face it, we are a few years behind the cricketers from Colombo and Kandy, which is understandable given the hardships we had endured,” Nishanthan sighs.

It’s not just infrastructural incompetence or decades of geographical alienation that has stymied Jaffna cricket – he insists that in the pre-war days, Jaffna was a cricketing powerhouse – but also societal and class disparities. “If you look at the students here, 70 per cent of them are from fishermen background, for whom sending their kids to college itself is a big accomplishment. Even look at the coaches here. We are not paid in lakhs as they do in St Joseph’s or Trinity. They even have specialized coaches. But here we are coaching the kids voluntarily, without getting a penny,” he says.

The biggest fillip for cricket in Jaffna will be if one of their 24 clubs progresses to the A division, but the best they’ve managed to reach is the pre-quarters of the third division. “At this moment, we are looking at not getting demoted to the fourth division,” says Nishanthan.

Like most of them associated with cricket in the vast stretches of the northern province, Nishanthan believes that turf wicket will sooner than later change their cricketing fortunes around. Now, the board has commissioned to build an international stadium as well. “Jaffna no longer wants to be associated with war, but as a cricketing powerhouse, as it once was,” he says. But it has spoiled Thangavelu’s meditational slumber.

***

The paint on the walls of St Patrick’s College is peeling. Like the town, the college too has bore the brunt of war. At the peak of the conflict, the college was a shelter to the victims and a dispensary. There were a few times the college ground was shelled by the Sri Lankan Army in the 80s. So, perhaps they cared less about preserving photographs. The remains of the past glory are just a handful of faded black-and-white photographs. Nishanthan’s index finger runs through the names on an old photograph with men in blazers holding a trophy, before it stops at one particular name. R Naguleswaran, a stocky man with a disarming smile, who played for their rivals Jaffna Central College. “He was one of the great fast bowlers, who couldn’t, unfortunately, play Test cricket,” he says.

A brisk left-arm seamer, who was a popular figure on the Colombo club circuit, Naguleswaran had emigrated to New Zealand, like several others from the northern province, just a little before Sri Lanka was accorded Test status. Thus was assumed that Jaffna could churn out fast bowlers. Former fast bowler and in-charge of talent development in the northern and eastern provinces, Ravindra Pushpakumara credits it to their naturally athletic built. “They are strong and sturdy and so have the ideal physique for fast bowlers. You won’t believe it, they can bowl for hours on end without even drinking water. That’s why we are focusing more on developing fast bowlers from this area,” he says.

He was also stunned by their classical actions. “When I look at these players from the north and east, I simply marvel at them. Some of these players are so naturally gifted. Their actions are so classical that there’s nothing that we have to correct. I only update them on the proper technique,” Pushpakumara says.

So he asked a couple of them whether they had developed their techniques watching television or Youtube videos. They replied with empty stares. “Forget Youtube, most of them don’t have even television sets at home. They say they developed it naturally, and when I pass through these areas and see boys playing cricket, I notice that they have really good actions, and that too without any coaching or academy in those places,” he says.

He calls them “uncut diamonds”. “Now we should groom them, give them exposure and hone their skills. It cannot be done overnight, but the place has great potential and the SLC is looking to tap it,” Pushpakumara says.

It’s in a sense ironic, as the most famous Tamil player to play for Sri Lanka was a spinner. But Nishanthan immediately retorts that Muttiah Muralitharan doesn’t strike an instant chord. “We don’t identify much with him. In fact, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara are more famous,” he says. It’s not a grouse or a protest, but they feel a genuine otherness about him.

Maybe, it’s because Murali’s family settled down in Sri Lanka in the early 20th century, or because he speaks a distinctively different twang, or because he has remained aloof from the Tamil cause. Whatever be, they are keenly awaiting the rise of one of their own heroes, one that would blur the chasm of class and clan, one that would shorten the special distance between Colombo and Jaffna.

"JD(U) parallel meets tomorrow, split indicated","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (PTI/File Photo) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (PTI/File Photo)

Rival JD(U) factions headed by Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav have called parallel meetings in Patna on Saturday indicating that the party may be heading for a split after the disintegration of the Grand Alliance in Bihar. A national executive committee meeting of the JD(U) has been called at its national president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence in Patna on Saturday where the party is expected to formally accept the invitation to join the BJP-led NDA.

Loyalists of Sharad Yadav, who has opposed joining hands with the BJP, are also organising a programme, ‘Jan Adalat’ at S K Memorial hall. The two meetings make it clear that battle lines within the JD(U) are drawn and the party may be heading for a vertical split. JD(U) principal secretary general K C Tyagi has, however, maintained that there is no split and that Yadav “has left voluntarily”.

Tyagi told PTI on Friday that the national executive meeting at the One Anne Marg residence of the chief minister is the party’s official programme.

The party was originally set to hold its national executive in Delhi on July 23-24 last. But the date was changed to August 19 and the venue was shifted to Patna. Asked about the agenda of the national executive meeting, Tyagi said it would put its seal of approval on the party’s Bihar unit decision to break away from the Grand Alliance and form a government with BJP “in the interests of the state”. Kumar had made it clear that he had walked out of the Grand Alliance of the JD(U), RJD and Congress as per the wish of the party’s Bihar unit.

The JD(U) is registered with the Election Commission as a regional party of Bihar, he had said. “The national executive would also give its consent to the invitation of BJP President Amit Shah to the JD(U) to join the NDA fold,” Tyagi said.

Shah had extended the invitation when Kumar had met him in Delhi recently. Some other amendments in the party constitution would also be taken up, he said, but refused to divulge details.

Asked about “Jan Adalat” which would also be attended by Yadav, Tyagi said it is not an official programme of the party. Bihar JD(U) chief spokesman Sanjay Singh said “we have nothing to do with the Jan Adalat programme.”

A poster war has erupted here with the rival groups publicising their respective programmes. The posters by rebel JD(U) leaders led by ousted party parlimentary board chief Sharad Yadav make clear their stand against Kumar’s decision to sever ties with the Grand Alliance partners — RJD and Congress

“Jan Adalat ka Faisla … Mahagatbandhan Jaari hain (Jan Adalat’s decision … The Grand Alliance is continuing)” the posters say. They carry photographs of Sharad Yadav, JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar Ansari and former state minister Ramai Ram, who was suspended by Bihar JD(U) chief Basistha Narayan Singh.

Sharpening the attack on Nitish Kumar, Ansari asserted in Delhi that those opposed to the Bihar chief minister represented the “real” JD(U), and added “Nitish represents BJP Janata Dal”. He refused to acknowledge a “split” in the party and said there is “sharp resentment” among JD(U) workers on the removal of Sharad Yadav as the leader of party MPs in the Rajya Sabha for questioning Nitish Kumar’s decision to form an alliance with the BJP.

Ansari said all the leaders of the party including Sharad Yadav would discuss the goings-on in the JD(U) at the convention here tomorrow and later visit the flood affected areas of Bihar. Ansari told PTI that their meeting is being held to honour people’s mandate given to Mahagatbandhan in 2015. He said he along with Sharad Yadav would arrive in Patna for the programme tomorrow morning.

“I and Sharadjee had thought of attending the national executive meeting and give our opinion against dumping of the Grand Alliance and joining hands with BJP. “But they (Nitish Kumar group) could not wait even till August 19 (tomorrow) and suspended me and removed Sharad jee from the post of parliamentary party chief, which is undemocratic,” Ansari said.

Another Sharad Yadav loyalist Vijay Verma, who was among 21 JD(U) leaders suspended recently, said, “Our programme is to strengthen secular forces in the country.” The rebel JD(U) programme follows a mega meeting of anti-BJP parties held yesterday in the national capital, which they said, was to save the “composite culture” of the country.

The party’s former national general secretary Arun Kumar Srivastava, who was expelled after the JD(U) legislator in Gujarat voted against the NDA candidate in the recent vice-presidential polls, said in Delhi that the rebels could approach the Election Commission to claim the party’s name and symbol in case of a split.

“Although I do not think Nitish will claim the party symbol because he has no love for the party or its symbol, but we will definitely approach the EC in case there is need,” he said. Srivastava also claimed that all the state party units, except those in Bihar and Jharkhand, were supporting Sharad Yadav and those opposed to Nitish Kumar.

“We have received support letters from the presidents of 14 state units who are opposed to the JD(U) alliance with BJP. They expressed their willingness to attend the Patna convention but may not be able to do so since it is being held at short notice,” he said.

He accused Nitish Kumar of not honouring the “democratic norms” in removing party leaders without seeking explanation. “I was not served any notice or asked for any explanation. The same happened with Sharad Yadav and Ali Anwar and 21 other leaders who were removed in Bihar,” he claimed.

Srivastava also attacked Tyagi for siding with Kumar and his decision to go with the BJP, saying he was doing so for the “lust of power”.
