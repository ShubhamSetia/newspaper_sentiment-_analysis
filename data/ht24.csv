Lalbaugcha Raja: Looks of Mumbai’s favourite Ganpati from 2012 to 2017,"The most visited Ganesh mandal of Mumbai, Lalbaugcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal revealed the first look of the idol on Monday.

Here are the five looks of the idol over the past five years

This year, the Ganesha idol has been sculpted to resemble the Korma avatar — the second avatar of Lord Vishnu.

The idol rests a tortoise throne against the backdrop designed Nitin Chandrakant Desai, a famous art director and production designer from Bollywood, of a Gajraj Mahal.

‘End of combustion engine-powered car’: Volvo to go all electric from 2019,"Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo’s plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

“This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” Volvo Cars chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully or partially electric.

“These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,” Volvo said.

“This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.”

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division.

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made."

Rafael Nadal back as World No.1 for first time since July 2014,"Rafael Nadal was confirmed as the world number one for the first time in three years in the latest ATP rankings released on Monday.

The Spaniard, who learned he was going to reclaim the ATP summit a week ago, last topped the men’s charts in July 2014.

The 31-year-old Spaniard, who won his 15th Grand Slam title this year at Roland Garros, deposes Britain’s Andy Murray, who withdrew from the tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati with a hip injury.

Nadal, who has spent 141 weeks in the top spot, has struggled with knee injuries since first becoming No. 1 in August 2008 after a Cincinnati semi-final run. He has admitted doubting he could ever regain the number one spot after so many years.

Nadal, knocked out in the Cincinnati quarter-finals last week by Australian Nick Kyrgios, had slipped to as low as 13th in the ATP rankings midway through 2015.

Kyrgios’s progress to Sunday’s Cincinnati final earned himn a five-rung rise to 18th with the man who beat him, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, breaking into the top 10 in 9th."

"Chinese automaker SAIC announces India entry, will start making cars in 2019","SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced plans to enter India and start manufacturing cars by 2019, becoming the first Chinese automaker to venture in what will be the world’s third biggest auto market by 2020.

SAIC, formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start making cars at its fully-owned manufacturing facility by 2019. SAIC is still negotiating to take over the General Motors’ Halol factory which closed operations on April 28 this year.

In India, SAIC has already registered its local subsidiary, MG Motors India. The company has roped in former GM India executives to lead its India operations -- Rajeev Chhaba will be president and managing director while P Balendran will be the executive director.

The largest automobile company in China stands 46th in the Fortune Global 500 list, with annual revenue of over $100 billion. The state-owned automaker has joint ventures in China with Detroit-headquartered GM and Germany’s Volkswagen, with brands such as MG, Roewe and Maxus under its belt.

Outside China, SAIC is present in several global markets including UK, USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Middle East, South East Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. It even has an ‘Overseas Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley, California.

What models will SAIC bring to India under the MG badge remains a mystery. Founded in 1924, the Morris Garage has seen several change of hands before China’s Nanjing Automobile Group acquired it in 2005. It came under the SAIC umbrella after SAIC merged with Nanjing in 2008.

“The introduction of the iconic British Sports Car Brand ‘MG’ in India is an important part of SAIC Motor’s global strategy. Our aim is to provide best-in-class vehicles, integrating sophisticated British design and quality, breakthrough product features and a pleasing ownership experience,” the company said in a statement.

“As a new-age auto company focused on innovation and technology, the company offers various solutions and technological capabilities required in the development of ‘new energy vehicles’, to cater to the changing needs of global customers and the overall ecosystem,” the statement added."

Meet the doctor who treated Gorakhpur’s first Japanese Encephalitis case in 1978,"Dr RN Singh was a 28-year-old senior resident in the department of paediatrics at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College when the hospital got its first case of what was later diagnosed as Japanese Encephalitis.

That was in 1978. Since then, the mosquito-borne viral infection has caused annual outbreaks in the region, killing hundreds of children each year.

“An 8-year-old boy was brought to the emergency early in the morning with a high fever that was about 104 degrees Fahrenheit, convulsions, and incoherent behaviour. He went into a coma six to eight hours later and died the next day. No one knew of what,” recalls Dr Singh. “Soon, the hospital was getting around 50 cases a year.”

Japanese encephalitis and the deadlier Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) became the national buzzwords after 30 children died between August 9 and 11 in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur’s largest government hospital, amid allegations that a private company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders cut supply over a payment dispute.

The state’s Bharatiya Janata Party government admitted the shortage but dismissed allegations that an interruption in oxygen supplementation, which is crucial for critical care patients, caused the deaths. It said the vector-borne disease and other complications were responsible. However, opposition parties blamed government apathy for the tragedy.

The first JE case was reported in the North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu in 1955 and the infection stayed confined to southern India till 1973 when it was recorded from Burdwan and Bankura districts of West Bengal. In 1978, suspected outbreaks of JE were reported from 18 states and 24 states and Union Territories.

“Gorakhpur did not have the testing facilities needed and a diagnosis was made on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. When cases started growing, samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which confirmed it as encephalitis caused by Japanese B virus,” the 68-year-old doctor said.

There is no cure for encephalitis and symptoms are treated to manage the disease. The death rate is a high 30%, which means 30 of the 100 people who develop the symptoms die of it. Neurological disabilities in JE survivors often affect limb movements, mental ability, hearing and speech.

Records at BRD’s physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) show it attended to 7525 cases in 2016-17 and 5750 in 2015-16. This year, the figure has already crossed the 4000-mark even as the peak season has set in for JE and AES.

After completing his residency, Dr Singh moved out of BRD and started a private practice in Gorakhpur and works to raise awareness about hygiene and early signs of encephalitis in the seven districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh— Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Basti, Deoria, Sant Kabir Nagar, and Sidharth Nagar. Of these, the worst affected are Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, and Maharajganj.

After Gorakhpur’s worst outbreak in 2005, India began vaccinating all children against JE from the next year. Vaccination, however, did not bring down the numbers, so India sought help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.

“NIV established a branch in Gorakhpur in 2007 and after extensive testing, concluded in 2007 that non-JE cases were also in circulation,” said Dr Singh.

Doctors began using the blanket term AES in 2008 for non-JE cases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemical, and toxins.

Like much of eastern UP, Gorakhpur is a JE-prone area and chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants a research centre in the area. But experts believe previous studies were good enough to reduce the number of deaths.

“Until we clearly identify the cause for these cases in Gorakhpur, outbreaks cannot be stopped,” said Dr Singh."

Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

FC Goa rope in Spanish winger Manuel Lanzarote for 2017-18 Indian Super League,"FC Goa confirmed the signing of Spanish winger Manuel Lanzarote for the fourth season of the Hero Indian Super League (ISL) on Thursday.

The winger, who was last plying his trade for Real Zaragoza in the second division of Spain, becomes Goa’s sixth foreign recruit.

A product of the La Masia, Lanzarote largely operates from the right wing but can also play in a more central attacking midfield position and on the wide left.

Join us welcoming our new signee Manuel Lanzarote, another foreign addition to the FC Goa squad in the upcoming #HeroISL season 4 #ForcaGoa pic.twitter.com/6gA5vvPEmJ — FC Goa (@FCGoaOfficial) August 23, 2017

With over 35 goals in the top two divisions of Spanish football, Lanzarote brings a wealth of experience with him and is expected to play a vital role in Goa’s charge for the title.

Having spent the major part of his career in Spain with the likes of Zaragoza, Espanyol, Deportivo Alaves and Eibar among others, this will be Lanzarote’s second foray outside Spain having previously turned out for Asteras Tripolis in Greece where he was a part of their Europa League campaign.

Having beaten several ISL clubs in the race to his signature, the Goan club will be hopeful Lanzarote can reproduce his form from the previous season where he scored six goals and assisted a further eight in Zaragoza’s campaign.

With Lanzarote’s signature, FC Goa’s reinforcement of foreigners is now up to six having signed the likes of Bruno Pinheiro, Ahmed Jahouh, Ferran Corominas, Manuel Arana and Sergio Juste previously."
Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

Screaming woman after Annabelle was scary? Watch people’s reaction to The Exorcist in 1973,"Four days ago, a video of a woman screaming and punching herself after watching Annabelle: Creation went viral. People got spooked on watching her retch and punch herself on the floor of a mall in Brazil.

As scary as Annabelle: Creation may have been, this isn’t the first time a horror film has received such a reaction from people.

The Exorcist changed the game for horror movies when it opened to record-breaking numbers back in 1973.

In a pre-Spielberg and Star Wars era, director William Friedkin’s adaptation of William Peter Blatty’s novel became a true cultural phenomenon, earning $440 million in 1973 money (more than $2 billion in adjusted currency).

YouTube users, historycomestolife and Behind The Exorcist unearthed a treasure in the form of videos from the very first screenings of the film in 2015. Prepare yourself for some pea-soup puking because the videos are a treat.

They’re supremely edited with a brilliant newsreel vibe. They transport you to an era familiar to many only through the movies, an era that’s just witnessed massive change through the Vietnam War and the freewheeling hippie culture, an era on the cusp of the new Hollywood movement.

It feels like you’re in one of those classic 70’s flicks, many of which were directed by William Friedkin, as audiences wait in queues, braving the elements, only to find that yet another screening has been sold out.

We can sense the anticipation in the crowd as they wait to finally experience what everyone’s been talking about. Remember, this was a time before spoilers could be posted on Twitter. It almost makes you wish you’d experienced some of today’s biggest movies armed with only a trailer and an innocent sense of wonder at the magic that could potentially happen in the dark environs of a movie theatre.

Once the audiences have finally seen the movie, we get to actually witness what all the fuss was about. We, as a modern audience, have been almost completely desensitized to gore and violence. But not these folks. We see them emerge from the theatre visibly shaken, some having left mid-way. Some appear to be dizzy, some just rattled at what they’ve seen; a few actually fainted. An usher assures us he was prepared, giving us a detailed plan he’s come up with to deal with fainters. He had smelling salts and little pellets on hand for just an occasion. ‘I hold it under their nose and they come to’, he says, with great importance.

A priest appears, lamenting that he is extremely depressed by it all, as others complain about racing hearts breathlessly. We see a man dismiss the film with great bravado as his partner lies, catatonic, with her head buried in her hands on a couch. Another man refuses to admit he was scared, but for the life of him, can’t understand why he fainted.What makes this story all the more enjoyable is the knowledge that most of these people left before seeing the iconic head-rotation scene (the infamous spider-crawl, interestingly, was not a part of the original theatrical cut and was included later).

The short documentary ends with an interview of Friedkin and Blatty, conducted by a priest as they debate whether the film deserves to be called a masterpiece.The Exorcist is perhaps the most influential horror film in the history of cinema. It starred Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair. These videos are a welcome reminder of just how amazing the film was, even if it doesn’t really hold up on the scares department: it’s still The Exorcist. We wouldn’t be where we are today without it.

Sri Lanka government to set up crisis panel to arrest decline in cricket fortunes,"The Sri Lanka government, alarmed by the national cricket team’s rapid decline in recent times, is setting up a crisis panel to address the concerns plaguing the former world champions.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said today he is to set up a special four-member panel consisting of senior officials who would convene a seminar within the next fortnight to look into the poor performance.

Sri Lanka’s national team is having a bad run since 2014, with the retirement of greats such as Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan.

They have lost their number one ranking in T20 while sliding badly in the Test and ODI tables.

This panel would involve former players, captains, former selectors, coaches, international experts, provincial cricket organisations and media.

They would discuss the poor showing by the national team and look to identify the problem areas, Jayasekera told reporters.

Since 2014, Sri Lanka lost home series twice to India, including the recent 0-3 Test whitewash in addition to defeats against Pakistan, Zimbabwe in the ODIs and the first-ever Test loss to Bangladesh.

Most recently, a section of the crowd unleashed its anger on the players after the team’s nine-wicket thrashing by India in the first ODI, chanting ‘no to politics, give us our cricket back’.

The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) management has come under fire for interference in team selections."
Book excerpt: We will have lost close to 50% of all species by 2050,"We are living in the future. When I was a child and I used to read about environmental destruction and warnings about what we were doing to our planet, the endgame was always projected well into the future. In the 1980s, dates like 2023, 2030 and so on sounded like very faraway times, times that would take a long time in coming. It felt like we had time in which to right wrongs and fix things. Today, however, as we stand in 2017, 2030 is only as far down the line as 2000 is behind us. Which means the time is going to come and come soon.

It is an indisputable fact that right now we are in the middle of the sixth great mass extinction. The sixth wave of species dieoffs in half a billion years. The rate of dieoff right now, though, is the worst that the world has seen since the disappearance of dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. What makes it worse is that this time this wave of extinction is on us. We did this. Extinction is a natural process in nature. Natural selection makes extinction possible. It is how the system works. However, extinction rates, if natural, are usually at the rate of one to five species per year. Today, we are losing species at the rate of 1,000 to 10,000 times that natural rate per year. Scientific estimates say that we will have lost close to 50 per cent of all species by the year 2050. We stand to lose one-fifth of the world’s species by 2025. These are dates that are not so far off.

Ecosystems thrive only because of biodiversity. When species die off, they tend to create a knock-on effect, taking with them other species that are dependent on them, thereby multiplying the rate of loss. This dieoff also allows certain other species to proliferate, causing further damage down the line.

The author with a jaguar at the Jukani Predator Park, South Africa. (Jurg Olsen)

What’s worse is that we are not even aware as yet of all the species on the planet. Scientists estimate that so far we have discovered about 1.2 million species; this includes not just mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, amphibians and aquatic species but also plant species. At present, it is believed that we have only discovered about 10 per cent of the species in the oceans. A new study by Canada’s Dalhousie University estimates that there are about 8.7 million species on earth. This means we have not even found 86 per cent of the world’s species and yet, we are losing them at an alarming rate. There have been disputes over this number but no one disputes the fact that we have only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to knowing about all the species on our planet. It is also an undisputed fact that each year, scientists discover about 15,000 new species.

The main reason for this devastating loss is anthropogenic activity, leading to habitat loss.

In India alone, according to the latest data acquired by a group of environmentalists from the Ministry of Environment and Forests through an RTI, about 333 acres of forest land are lost every day. Most of the land is diverted for industrial and development projects. As of September 2011, 47 species of animals were marked critically endangered as listed by the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and 49 species have been listed as endangered. Hundreds more are listed as threatened and as vulnerable. Many of the animals on the endangered and critically endangered lists like our big cats and elephants and sharks are vital keystone and apex species of our various ecosystems and their loss will wipe out even that which is not considered especially threatened.

It is estimated that about 21.2 per cent of India is covered by forests. These are figures released by the Ministry for Environment and Forests and Climate Change. Conservationists argue against this figure by stating that the figures include plantations and orchards and groves of eucalyptus, poplars, teak and other plantation species which have questionable conservation values. As of now, less than 5 per cent of these forests are protected. These are the dense rich forests with adequate biodiversity that contain most of India’s animal and plant species. It is an unavoidable truth that forests that lie outside the ambit of protected areas are being slowly degraded and that important wilderness areas like scrub jungles, grasslands and wetlands are often overlooked as biodiversity hotspots as they do not fall under the conventional classification of forests. Right now, the Environment Ministry has asked states to identify what they call ‘degraded forests’ and give up 40 per cent of them to private management. This narrow view that only tree cover makes a forest has been the biggest detriment to India’s wild habitats. Also, the tree cover that is planted is usually monoculture of non-indigenous fast-growing species that does not help biodiversity.

And in our budget in 2015, we cut the allocations for environment and wildlife down by nearly a quarter to Rs 1,681 crores. Project Tiger has had its budget cut by 16 per cent. All these cuts while threats from climate change are looming large and the country has already received a warning of what is to come with the bad combination of unchecked progress, lack of environment awareness and unpredictable climates both with the Uttarakhand disaster and the floods in Kashmir. Floods in the North East and Assam has displaced close to 1.5 million people and the disaster is still ongoing. There is no disputing these facts – dams on the upstream rivers and unchecked constructions on flood plains and aquifers and illegal sand mining of river banks and deforestation destabilising river banks, all these have contributed to this disaster. Every year, cyclones ravage our coasts and the allocated budget for coastal management is Rs 100 cores. We have 7,000 kilometres of coastline in India threatened by development and industry and a burgeoning population facing down an inclement sea. Already every year, during and after the monsoons and storm season, thousands of people lose their homes and become displaced with nowhere to go.

And in the middle of these challenges, the government, instead of working on finding solutions, is more interested in extracting greater amounts of coal out of the ground, taking over forest lands for development and making no concessions to cut carbon emissions. Hundreds of more dams are being planned in the North East and the Himalayas while being aware that these are seismically sensitive zones.

How Sri Lanka coach was bullied by cricket officials ahead of 2nd ODI vs India,"Sri Lankan cricket, in crisis with the national team plunging from one low on the field to another in the ongoing India tour, scrambled on Wednesday to limit the public relations disaster that followed defeat against Virat Kohli’s side in the first One-day International at Dambulla at the weekend.

Sri Lankan cricket team’s interim coach, Nic Pothas had blasted the current set up following the nine-wicket defeat at Dambulla saying “too many cooks” were responsible for the current plight of the national team, which was also routed 3-0 in the Test series.

However, Sri Lanka Cricket took the drastic step on Wednesday of asking South African Pothas to issue a statement at the press conference ahead of the second ODI to be played at the Pallekele International Stadium on Thursday.

Pothas this time said everything was fine with the team set-up and the processes put in place would pull Sri Lanka out of the rut. He even blamed the media for putting a “spin” of his previous statement and that he had no issues with the Sri Lankan cricket board.

His comments were in contrast to that on Sunday when he said the players suffered because there were too many people meddling in selection and decision-making. Stalwarts of the 1996 World Cup triumph, Sanath Jayasuriya (chief selector) and Asanka Gurusinha (cricket manager), play influential roles.

“We will start off with a statement from the coach, and then a statement from the captain before we going into the Q & A,” announced Vrai Raymond, SLC’s media head. “We would like to limit it to tomorrow’s match and nothing else.”

“India, England too struggled”

With ODI skipper, Upul Tharanga, seated beside him, Pothas said: “We are in good shape at the moment; we have had a couple of training sessions. The boys are in very good spirits. As I mentioned before, we are very, very focused on the processes and procedures which will stand us in good stead in the future. That future will take time as we have stated before.

“We certainly can’t wave any magic wands around. We are in a position at the moment where England, India, Australia they have all found themselves in. We certainly have learnt from them and spoken to them. We are very, very confident how we are going to work.

“As for tomorrow, we just come on and keep on fighting. I’m very happy with everything that is going on within that four walls in that change room.

“And just to clarify things because you guys love a little spin on a good story, I’m very, very happy with the situation with the Board, which has been hugely supportive of everything that I do and the players do. Certainly I have no issues there.”"
"In 2017, over 3,000 Chandigarh women made distress calls","More than 3,000 city women called at the emergency helpline number 100 and 1091 in past seven months, seeking help in incidents of harassment, stalking, domestic violence and other cases of crime against of women.

According to figures provided by the police, 1,030 women contacted the Police Control Room (PCR) while 2,001 calls were received by women helpline (1091) till July 31. In 2016, PCR reported 1,362 such complaints and women helpline got 3,389.

Harassment common

Harassment is the most common complain which were received by the PCR. This year, out of 700 spots (cases in which police is sent) registered with the PCR, 325 spots were of harassment. A similar trend was reported last year, in which 550 spots out of 800 were of similar nature.

The number of complaints of attempt to rape cases has shown a comparative dip this year. As many as 12 complaints of attempt to rape were reported last year as compared to five such cases till July 31, 2017 .

‘Daily, we receive at least 16 calls from women. They are either college girls, complaining of harassment, stalking, cyber-bullying, or are house wives, complaining of domestic violence,” said a woman police officer at the PCR.

PCR answers 3,000 calls a day

Police Control Room, located at the fifth floor of the Police head quarters, Sector 9 is a beehive of activities where phones do not stop ringing even for a minute. It receives over 3,000 calls in a day and over 300 spots. The number increases to 4,000 during the festival seasons.

In 2016, the Police Control Room received over 1 lakh spots. The calls received were 10 times more.

The most common calls received at the PCR are related to scuffles followed by accidents, noise pollution, women safety, traffic related issues and others.

In 2016, the PCR received over 1 lakh spots, out of which 37,000 (2017: 22,400) were about quarrels, 17,000 (2017: 10,300) were about accidents, 5000 (2017: 2700) related to noise pollution. Around 7,000 calls related to traffic issues in two years (crosshead) (If needed please delete)

The PCR has received 4000 calls in 2016 and 2900 calls this year, so far about people complaining of wrong parking.

Feedback mechanism

One person has been assigned the duty to get feedback from people who had called 100 number. “Daily 5-6 people show their displeasure from the police , so we forward that complaint to the concerned police station,” he said."
"Trump’s speech signals a strategy for South Asia, not just for Afghanistan","It took US President Donald Trump months to finally decide on his policy for Afghanistan, America’s longest war. Trump’s reluctance to immediately acquiesce to his military’s demands did result, though, in the most careful study of various Afghanistan options undertaken by any US administration – and one that also holds out the promise of transforming South Asia’s dynamics for the better.

President Trump did well in his speech to justify continued US engagement in Afghanistan, and key to that was the open-ended commitment of troops and the decision not to specify troop numbers. The US military and their civilian counterparts have never had the time horizon to effectively implement measures that could have strengthened the Afghan state or weakened terrorist organisations that continue to maintain region-wide support networks. Afghan security forces have fought bravely but lack adequate air power, leadership, retention rates and coalition support to stem the tide of a resurgent Taliban, which now controls more ground than at any point since 2001. The new, open-ended commitment will also boost the morale of the Afghan security forces, who are engaged in more than two dozen battles against the Taliban across the country.

Just as importantly, by approaching the Afghan strategy as a South Asian one, Washington is recognising again that this is a regional challenge. For the US to have withdrawn from Afghanistan would have prompted the collapse of the state and most likely resulted in greater factional violence. India, Pakistan, Iran and others would have been forced to increase support to their chosen sides in the conflict, exacerbating regional tensions and perhaps setting the scene for a disastrous showdown in the region. Pakistan and its 120 nuclear warheads would have become more vulnerable. Already Iran, Russia and China have been looking to exert greater influence in Afghanistan given Washington’s silence (perceived as absence) thus far.

President Trump’s decision to specifically mention India in his speech reflects New Delhi’s deep ties to Afghanistan. India remains Afghanistan’s most important regional partner, contributing to the construction of key dams, roads, power infrastructure and even the Afghan parliament building; committing $200mm in small development projects; and providing food aid, educational scholarships and other in-kind support. Its Afghanistan-friendly tariffs have transformed India into one of Afghanistan’s primary export markets.

At the same time, his mention of Pakistan lays much of the blame on Afghanistan’s eastern neighbour. The Afghans and international partners cannot prevail unless the Taliban’s support networks, training camps and safe havens in Pakistan are dealt with. But Washington now needs to match its words with deeds. Through specific publicly and privately communicated conditions – and through delivering on promised consequences – Washington should this time aim to change Pakistan’s behaviour rather than just its public statements. At the same time, it will have to communicate to Pakistan why, and how, playing a positive role in Afghanistan will not be a threat to Pakistan’s own national interest.

Taken together, this renewed commitment to Afghanistan and increased engagement of India and Pakistan could have the side benefit – but an enormous one -- of fostering improved relations across the region. If Afghanistan can be used as a cause for all three countries to rally around, there is a real possibility that that cooperation could ease broader tensions between them and potentially result in closer ties.

There are of course other key elements to Trump’s strategy. The floundering and deeply unpopular National Unity Government in Afghanistan needs to deal with corruption, broaden its base and earn its legitimacy, as ultimately it relies for its survival on the support of the Afghan people. Trump was right to demand that the Afghans need to do much of the heavy lifting and that US support will not come in the form of a blank cheque. He was also right to not insist on peace talks with the Taliban; their intransigence and continued terrorist attacks reflect their unwillingness to talk. Only a strong government in Kabul coupled with gains in the battlefield will prompt them to seriously consider a settlement.

As announced on Monday, the ultimate goal of US strategy will continue to be the prevention of terrorist groups from using Afghan territory for launching or planning attacks against the US. However, as the President mentioned, this cannot happen in isolation. There are many moving parts to this reset involving the Afghan government, the US and Nato allies. Just as importantly, for the greater good of the region, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan should work together in unison for Afghanistan’s future.

Hyundai Motor to launch electric vehicle with 500 km range after 2021,"Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday it will launch a long-range electric vehicle with a driving range of 500 km (311 miles) per charge after 2021, seeking to address investor concerns that it is lagging rivals in the green car race.

The automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp, which together rank fifth in global vehicle sales, also said they are planning 31 eco-friendly models by 2020, up from a previously flagged 28.

The new additions include three plug-in hybrid vehicles, which come on top of eight battery-powered cars and two fuel-cell vehicles.

Battery-powered cars offered by the likes of Tesla are gaining traction faster than fuel cell vehicles backed by Hyundai and Toyota Motor Corp.

Last year, Hyundai launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle’s per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and GM.

The automaker said will introduce an electric version of its Kona small sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a driving range of 390 km in the first half of next year.

It also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.

Hyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 800 km per charge under European standards, nearly double the 415 km for its current Tucson fuel cell SUV.

The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by US and European markets.

A fuel cell electric bus is slated to be unveiled late this year, while a sedan-type fuel cell car is also planned."
A decade of soaring Delhi University cutoffs,"If you scored less than 70% in Class 12, this year you have close to 26 options across Delhi University colleges. Only subjects offered — Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu.

A decade ago, you had at least 120 — the options, slight more diverse, with subject choices such as History and Political Science as well.

As senior secondary board examinations across the country keep seeing rising scores due to moderation, Delhi University cutoffs keep increasing to accommodate only a limited number of students on the top.

While the Commerce courses have historically been in the 85+ bracket, the rise of Humanities has emerged only in the recent years. Today, courses like History and Political Science require as many marks as one would need for popular courses like Economics.

This year, over 60% of Delhi University cutoffs for the general category have crossed the 90% mark. In 2008, this figure was merely at 8%.

Additional Research: Manas SharmaNote: Data was collated from the Delhi University website and HT archives. All cutoffs are from the first list and indicate the minimum score required in the general category. There is no data for several courses such as B.A. (P) in 2013 due to the introduction of FYUP. All popular courses have been included except for English and Journalism because those had an entrance test earlier. The data does not include St. Stephen's College and Jesus and Mary College."

MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

"Microsoft: 500M Windows 10 devices, half of 2018 goal","Microsoft says a half billion devices are now running Windows 10, its latest operating system.

That’s up from 400 million disclosed last September, but far short of a goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won’t hit 1 billion in time . Getting halfway has taken nearly two years.

Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after a disastrous Windows 8 launch and heavy competition from phone systems such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Getting more devices on Windows 10 will help encourage companies to make more apps and services for it.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed the figure Wednesday at a Microsoft conference in Seattle.

"Nitish ‘destroying’ Srijan scam evidence, alleges Lalu; says PM for Bihar poll in 2019","Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad on Wednesday accused chief minister Nitish Kumar of ‘destroying evidence’ in the multi-crore Srijan scam, by having his ‘favourite’ officer, who also ‘happens to be of his caste’, to lead the economic offences unit (EOU) probe into one of the biggest financial frauds.

“Can an officer, who has participated in programmes of Srijan in the capacity of senior SP of Bhagalpur, ensure an impartial inquiry into the scam?” asked Prasad, wondering as to why the EOU could not lodge any FIR in the case even a fortnight after the inquiry was launched.

The RJD chief was particularly upset over the decision to send EOU IG JS Gangwar to probe the case, even though he had participated in a number of programmes of the non-governmental organisation, Srijan, when he was SSP of Bhagalpur. Prasad, however, did not name the officer.

Srijan has been found to have hundreds of crores of rupees of government money into its accpunts over many years, fraudulently.

The RJD leader asked the CM as to why action was not initiated against the guilty even when the matter was brought to the light in 2013 by the EOU. “Why the district magistrate of Bhagalpur, who lodged the FIR against Srijan, was transferred hurriedly? And what happened to the DM’s report about the scam? Why did the state government try to hush up the financial scam, even as the CAG in its 2008 report had busted in,” asked Prasad.

Slamming the chief minister for propagating ‘falsehood’ about the RJD’s bid to break the JD(U), Prasad alleged that Kumar had been in the habit of telling lies. “He (Kumar) had once said he would prefer being ruined (mitti mein mil jayenge) than to join hands with the BJP. But now, he has fallen at the BJP’s feat,” said Prasad.

The RJD chief said he had asked the participants of his ‘Desh Bachao, Bhajapa Bachao’ rally, in Patna, on August 27, to come with one fistful of soil for the CM.

On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bihar to oversee flood situation, Prasad said the PM was coming here to discuss the BJP’s plan of preponing the state elections and hold it along with Lok Sabha polls, due in 2019. “Modi is coming here to divert the people’s attention from the RJD rally. What is meaning of his visit, when flood is on receding trend,” asked the RJD leader.

Regarding the participation of leaders of other parties in the RJD rally, Prasad claimed that Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad and CP Joshi would represent the party in the programme, while BSP chief Mayavati had deputed Satish Mishra to attend it.

“JD(U) Rajya Sabha member Sharad Yadav and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee are among those slated to address the rally,” said the RJD chief."

Eunice de Souza (1940-2017): No Tears in the Eye of the Storm,"Eunice de Souza (1940-2017) never had the slightest patience with the claims of a normality imposed by consensus or authority. Not one to be trapped in a ghetto, whether ethnic, academic or political, she early embraced the rapture of all that was strange and liberating. In her poem ‘Return’, she revisits the moment when she first heard the French Jesuit and translator Guy Deleury, then resident at the Christa Prema Seva Ashram, read the Marathi saint-poet Tukaram’s abhangas:

Tuka, forgive my familiarity.

I have loved your pithy verses

ever since that French priest

everyone thought mad

recited them, and told us

of his journey with your people.

…

You made life hard for your wife

and I’m not sure I approve of that.

Nor did you heed her last request:

Come back soon.

Deleury, with his lifelong devotion to Tukaram and to India’s Bhakti literature of ecstasy and protest, was an emancipatory part of de Souza’s growing up in Poona, where she was born in 1940. Demonstrating her refusal to conform to what she experienced as the stifling pieties and norms of her Goan Catholic birth community, she sought out unusual, even eccentric figures like Deleury (who later renounced his priestly calling and entered secular life) and the Santiniketan-trained Goan émigré artist Angelo da Fonseca, whose radiant Indianisation of Christian iconography had prompted orthodox opinion to cast him into exterior darkness. Such presences, and the pathways they opened up, nourished de Souza’s imagination.

At the same time, as a young poet and academic, de Souza articulated the difficulties confronted by a woman making her way in the India of the 1960s and 1970s, a postcolonial society in which feudalism and patriarchy continued to dominate public life and the accepted perception of gender destiny. As a student in the Midwest at the beginning of the 1960s, de Souza would surely have caught the thrum of dissidence that would soon challenge the American ascendancy in the name of race, gender and sexual choice during the civil rights movements. Although she returned to India in 1963, these revolutions in thought and practice inspired her at a distance. While the label ‘confessional’ is a reductive and inadequate one, de Souza’s encounter with the work of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Adrienne Rich offered her models of poetry that opened up forms of public expression for women, forms that allowed for the naming and saying of personal experiences that had no place in a patriarchal framework.

Eunice de Souza with former chief minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah at the Goa Art & Literature Festival, 2012. ((Siddesh Mayenkar/Herald Review))

De Souza’s feminism was mapped along a spectrum from the sardonic to the ferocious. Some of her targets were more fortunate than others. Tukaram, loved for his startling and often irreverent poetry of mystical transport, is gently rebuked for his indifference to his wife’s struggles. But in the precisely titled ‘Autobiographical’, de Souza appears to pay the patriarchy back in its own coin before recording the insight that structural violence replicates itself in an internalised counter-violence of the individual that is every bit as corrosive and depleting:

I thought the whole world

was trying to rip me up

cut me down go through me

with a razor blade

then I discovered

a cliché: that’s what I wanted

to do to the world.

In the later ‘Songs of Survival’, she registers a move towards a more stoic, ironic stance, not resignation so much as wisdom:

Practice grave courtesy:

there are no tears in the

eye of the storm.

Survive to know you can.

There is little to be said

for suffering.

It has been tempting for many readers to interpret de Souza’s poetry as the unfolding chronicle of an embattled self constantly crafting idioms of belonging in a hostile world. While this account has its own relevance, a survey of her expanded practice reveals the opposite of self-absorption. Her approach to the world was versatile and founded on a restless curiosity. Throughout her career, de Souza was active as a literary critic, editor, researcher, and columnist. She wrote art criticism for some years, and retained a lively interest in the visual arts. She wrote books for children and compiled benchmark anthologies such as These My Words: The Penguin Book of Indian Poetry, a collaboration with her lifelong friend and colleague Melanie Silgardo.

To mourn de Souza is also to mourn a period and a milieu in Bombay’s cultural life when the arts had not become narrowly professionalised and mutually separated, and when compelling intellectual and artistic synergies exploded across the scene. Writers and painters, architects and filmmakers, activists and advertising professionals met, formed friendships and collegialities, often collaborated, or inspired one another’s enterprises. Poets like Nissim Ezekiel transited between academia and the visual arts. Poets like Arun Kolatkar and Dilip Chitre straddled the worlds of literature and advertising. Poets like Adil Jussawalla were active in academia, journalism and publishing. These cultural experimenters and their contemporaries were responsive to theatre and music, often working together with colleagues to develop work beyond the page. Many of them were engaged in translation, as a bridge between languages and language-universes separated by historical circumstances. They were committed to keeping the transmission lines of literature open, whether through little magazines or small presses, as the splendid recent research of scholars like Laetitia Zecchini and Anjali Nerlekar has shown.

While the Clearing House publishing collective has, correctly, received retrospective acclaim for its role in this history, the 1960s and 1970s were animated by numerous, often intersecting, mutually replenishing reading circles and publishing platforms of varying longevity. Among these were the circle around Nissim Ezekiel at the PEN, the salons that Kamala Das convened, imprints such as Pras Prakashan, and successors to Clearing House such as Newground and Praxis, which published de Souza’s early collections of poetry. The critical, vigorously recalcitrant, self-renewing energies of this background continued to pulse through Eunice de Souza’s work until the very end. Wintry as its wisdom sounds, her last book of poems, Learn from the Almond Leaf, published last year, offers us unquiet, incandescent meditations like ‘A Smattering of Rain’:

A smattering of rain,

Earth lets off steam.

A hawk falls.

A volcano upchucks.

Watch it!

Earth’s heart is still

smouldering.

"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."
Qatar says ‘no delays’ on 2022 FIFA World Cup despite political and economic crisis,"Doha, Aug 20, 2017 (AFP) - Qatar’s 2022 World Cup preparations have been inconvenienced but not delayed by the political and economic boycott by its neighbours, the country’s most senior tournament organiser insisted Sunday.

Hassan Al-Thawadi, Secretary General the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, said alternative suppliers outside those countries involved in the ongoing dispute have been found for tournament-related construction projects.

“The impact has been minimal,” Thawadi told Doha-based broadcaster Al-Jazeera English in an interview to be aired later on Sunday.

“In terms of stadium progress or stadium construction and infrastructure requirements for the World Cup, progress is being made as well.”

He added that the crisis has “caused an inconvenience”.

Asked outright if projects had been delayed, Thawadi responded: “Projects are on schedule. No delays have occurred.”

Qatar has been isolated since June 5 when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with the World Cup host -- accusing it of backing extremism and fostering ties with Iran -- triggering the biggest political crisis in the Gulf for several years.

Doha denies the claims.

Qatar initially gave priority to Gulf suppliers for the vast construction projects -- the country is spending $500m a week on World Cup projects -- accompanying the controversial tournament.

Since the conflict began some have questioned whether the gas-rich emirate can subsequently meet deadlines to build or renovate the eight stadiums currently earmarked for 2022.

But Doha has said it swiftly replaced Saudi and UAE companies with Chinese and Malaysian contractors, among others, since June 5.

Qatar is soon expected to unveil its latest designs for further stadiums.

Since winning the 2022 bid seven years ago, Qatar has been dogged by controversy over allegations of corruption to secure the tournament and the abuse of workers building stadiums, claims which it denies."
Virat Kohli’s mantra: Create aggressive environment in Indian cricket,"The Indian cricket team has so far done the athletic equivalent of running against the clock on this Sri Lanka tour. With the hosts in disarray, the visitors have set and accomplished their own targets.

Virat Kohli has led India in just 31 ODIs -- 14 of them since taking over from MS Dhoni in January. These are early days, but a good opportunity to try out a few things.

The Indian skipper has urged players not to look at the opposition in Sri Lanka but instead play with intensity. With this ODI series being the first step towards the 2019 World Cup, all players are eager to grab the chances they get.

READ | ‘Ravichandran Ashwin very much in frame for 2019 Cricket World Cup’

In the first ODI in Dambulla on Sunday, which India won by nine wickets, Virat Kohli set some of the plans in motion.

Choosing to bowl on a good pitch, he asked Hardik Pandya, and not Jasprit Bumrah, to share the new ball with Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

The young all-rounder, who made an impact in Tests, took a while to settle down, and bowled only six overs. But the skipper believes he could provide the X-factor going forward.

Kohli has also taken the big decision to keep out Ajinkya Rahane and bring KL Rahul at No 4 as both openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are in fine nick. If either fail, it will be interesting to see if he drafts in Rahane as opener or moves Rahul up.

Asked about his ODI captaincy on the eve of the series, he said: “It’s very basic, simple. One-day cricket, T20 cricket, anything, you have to be positive in your mindset. With the bat, you have to look to consolidate every situation, you have to stay one step ahead of the opposition.

“Even as a bowling unit, you need to look for wickets all the time. (With) ODI cricket there’s no guarantee. You can’t come back into the game… Sometimes, sides are better than you because they also have eleven quality players.

“Not change your mindset, always be aggressive, pick up wickets and try to save every run possible. That kind of environment, if created, rubs off on everyone and everyone gets into that zone of ‘you have the ball in hand you’re going for wickets first’.

“The mindset, I feel has to be optimistic and positive. Taking wickets is the only way you can control runs in one-day cricket. If you give 30 in 10 overs and don’t take wickets, in the last 10 overs that’s going to be covered up.”"
"India vs Sri Lanka: MS Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar Kumar clinch thriller at Pallekele","Sri Lanka spinner Akila Dananjaya triggered a stunning batting collapse before India recovered to win the second ODI at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.

The diminutive spinner wrecked the innings, capturing six wickets in the space of 20 deliveries to leave India, chasing a revised target of 231 off 47 over after a rain delay, in disarray.

India were reduced to 131 for seven after Dananjaya’s triple strike in an over before Mahendra Singh Dhoni (45 no) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (53 no) put on a 100-run eighth wicket partnership to take the team to a tense three-wicket win for a 2-0 series lead.

Dananjaya, who bowls a mix of off-spin, straighter ones, leg-breaks and googlies in an island famous for its unorthodox bowlers, stole the thunder, flummoxing the Indian batsmen mainly with his googly. He finished with a career-best 6/54.

India reached 231 for 7 in 44.2 overs.

Opener Rohit Sharma (54) hit his fastest ODI half-century off 43 balls and with Shikhar Dhawan (49) had raised 109 in reply to Sri Lanka’s 236/8 when Dananjaya, who came on in the 12th over, struck.

Dananjaya first trapped Rohit Sharma with a leg-break. He claimed five of his first six wickets bowled or leg before. Sri Lankan fans, dismayed by their team’s poor run, erupted in joy as the diminutive spinner took off after each strike chased by delirious teammates.

The Indian collapse began after skipper Virat Kohli, deciding to give later batsmen useful batting time, sent KL Rahul at No 3. But the experiment turned into a test against an unknown kind.

Rohit Sharma was sent his way after a failed review, indicating he was done in by a leg-break. Shikhar Dhawan was gone next over, 17th of the innings, after his uppish sweep off left-arm spinner Milinda Siriwardana was caught brilliantly by Angelo Mathews at square leg.

Dananjaya broke the back of the Indian batting in nine deliveries, after claiming three in the 18th over.

He first bowled Kedar Jadhav (1) with a googly. Two balls later, he stunned skipper Virat Kohli (4) with another pefect googly that went between bat and pad to hit the stumps.

India, who had faced little challenge all tour, showed some panic. And two balls later, KL Rahul too was bowled off a googly. It was like how Indian batsmen were caught out by Ajantha Mendis almost a decade ago.

Hardik Pandiya was stumped next, also beaten by a googly, while Axar Patel was trapped by a straighter one. India were 131 for seven off 21.4 overs.

Dhoni, who must have faced Dananjaya in the Chennai Super Kings nets, picked him better. And once he was off the attack after bowling eight overs, Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar settled down to take India past 200.

With both batsmen set, and Danajaya looking tired coming on to bowl his last two overs, the battle was settled.

BUMRAH SHOW

India seemed to script a similar win to the nine-wicket effort in Dambulla when pacer Jasprit Bumrah claimed 4/43 and leg-spinner Yuzhvendra Chahal two for 43 after Virat Kohli won his fifth toss in a row, electing to bowl.

Sri Lanka’s set openers Niroshan Dickwella (31) and Dhanushka Gunathilaka (19) fell to Bumrah and Chahal respectively to undermine their batting. They owed the total to Milinda Siriwardana, who top-scored with 58 (58 b, 2x4, 1x6). He was one of the three changes made in the side, Dananjaya and pacer Dushmantha Chameera being the others."
Okja movie review: The first great film of 2017 has arrived. Protect it fiercely. 5 stars,"Okja

Director - Bong Joon-ho

Cast - Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins

Rating - 5/5

If getting booed at the Cannes Film Festival is considered a badge of honour, it is a badge Okja must wear with pride.

It joins a list of films – a list that will probably have you performing an almost comical double-take in a moment – that for various bizarre reasons, found themselves at the receiving end of the famously snooty French crowd’s ire.

In ’76, it was Martin Scorsese’s bleak and brutal Taxi Driver. In ’94, it was Quentin Tarantino’s cultural watershed Pulp Fiction. And in 2011, it was Terrence Malick’s masterpiece, The Tree of Life. Each of these classics was heckled at their Cannes screenings. And each of these films, despite the heckling, won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.

In 2017, the honour (the booing, but sadly not the Palme) went to Okja, the new film by cult South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho – although for reasons we’ve never heard before. Despite ending with one of the most unexpectedly forceful tonal shifts in recent memory – the film goes from being a magical, Miyazaki-esque fable, to a horrifying skewering of mankind in the space of 30 minutes – the most controversial moment in Okja’s Cannes premiere came before it even began. When the Netflix logo ‘duh-dum-ed’ its way onto the screen, the old-school crowd let its disapproval (and fear of the future) be known. Critic David Ehrlich, tweeting from inside the Palais, described it as a ‘prison riot environment.’

It’s natural, as spoiled, needy human beings, for us to want better, never satisfied with what we have. Similarly, it is natural, while the glorious Okja unfolds before your eyes, to wonder just how different it would be on a big screen. Would it be better? Would it be worse? Would the lush Korean landscapes be more breathtaking? Or would the cracks in the CGI be more visible?

Tilda Swinton as Lucy Mirando in OKJA

We will never know. And that is OK. Because despite making the cardinal sin of not being made available to your local multiplex, Okja does what most event movies and summer blockbusters, proudly shot in IMAX, can’t. It cares about its characters, its tone, its craft, and it has enough confidence in you, the audience, to stick with it, even when it becomes too challenging, and even when the mirror it holds up to your face reveals all the blemishes you’ve been trying to hide.

Its story begins several years ago, in a colourful prologue. Tilda Swinton plays the CEO of a powerful multi-national corporation, who, with great fanfare, announces the discovery of a new pig-like creature that her company will breed, and then ship off to 26 far-flung corners of the world, to live with local farmers.

10 years later, in a remote mountain-top farm in South Korea, one of the creatures, now grown up, bounds across the gorgeous countryside, a young girl by its side. She is Mija, the granddaughter of one of the farmers chosen to care for the animal, and she has named it, also a girl, Okja. This is their world. It is all they have. And it is all they need.

Wordlessly, with the aid of some truly wonderful creature design and visual effects, Bong conveys the essence of his film these opening scenes. It is a story about nature and nurture. It is a story about being an innocent child trapped in a harsh world run by adults who’ve been ruined by it, by greed, and by success.

But above all else, it is a story about the evil of mankind, and the depths to which we are capable of sinking. Much like his previous movie, the monumentally underrated Snowpiercer (another film in which he gave Tilda Swinton a memorably despicable character to play), Okja, too is a science fiction story, just as nihilistic, just as furious at our hypocrisy, and just as unforgettable.

OKJA

Like Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, it addresses real-life horrors by replacing images seared into our minds with fantasy, with animals, and with humour.

And fantasy is what Mija needs, when one day, a sweaty, moustachioed, obnoxious American hikes up to her farm. He is Dr Johnny Wilcox, employee of the Tilda Swinton’s MNC, played by a screechingly over-the-top Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes bearing terrible news. In one fell swoop, he destroys Mija’s world. He has come to take Okja away from her.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox in Okja.

Mija’s grandfather, a poor farmer, has already made the deal. It’ll keep food on their bellies. Perhaps it’ll pay for her education too. He’s only coming through the promise he made to her dead parents. He’s taking care of their daughter.

But Mija isn’t the sort of girl to take injustice lying down. She isn’t the sort of girl to resign herself to her fate – or to let Okja fall prey to hers. She packs a bag, breaks open her piggy bank, and journeys across the world to New York, where she plans to break into the headquarters of the Mirando Corporation, and rescue Okja.

Along the way, she is joined by members of the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), played by Paul Dano, Lilly Collins and Steven Yeun, who, despite having their own twisted agenda, are the closest the film comes to having decent people (besides Mija, of course).

OKJA

In a fair world, Okja would have the power to make even the most belligerent meat eaters consider vegetarianism. It would make us question the truths we ignorantly accept. It would make us seek answers, challenge the consumerist culture we so blindly embrace. It would inspire change. But – and Okja would be the first to remind us of this – the world is hardly a fair place.

As an animal lover, I wouldn’t wish the very particular emotional jolt this movie delivers on my worst enemy. Be warned: There is very little hope here. There is only bleakness. But there’s no turning away from Okja. We must spread word about it. We must champion it. Because it is the first great film of 2017.

After slamming “too many cooks” for spoiling Sri Lankan cricket team in the wake of Indian cricket team’s crushing win in the first ODI on Sunday, interim head coach Nic Pothas was forced to issue statement saying all is fine with the process in pla... read more"
"THE CLASS OF 2018: When parents are short on time and money, kids struggle in school","""Every time a parent asks how the student is doing, they do better,"" says Sanu. ""As SMC members, we have a direct channel with their teachers, too. So kids know that we are not only reliant on their words to know how they are performing. I can easily ask their teachers."" Both Sanu and Devi agreed that getting to know teachers cultivates in their children a certain sort of productive ""fear"".

As the education levels of Chandrashekhar's children has surpassed his own, he says he has become less involved in their lives.

Where Sanu and Devi are assertive, Chandrashekhar is diffident. ""My kids are more educated than me now,"" he says. ""How do I help them out at home? All I do is ask them once in a while how they are doing at school, if they have done their homework. That is all.""

Yet Chandrashekhar's son, Arvind, who is in Class 9 at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, says he benefits from personal attention from his father. ""When my father asks me about school, it makes me feel like he cares. It matters what I do and how I perform in school. I think I work extra hard on the days he asks.""

Saransh Vaswani, the co founder of Saajha, a not for profit organisation that works to enable parents to participate in the learning of their children and the School Management Committees, confirms that frequent interactions between parents and students are crucial — no matter how educated the parents are.

""It's okay if you are not literate,"" he says. ""You could interact with your child while you are cooking, talk to them about shapes and colours. We have even given parents and students simple worksheets to fill out together. Simple things like, match the 'ba' with 'batak'.""

But like Chandrashekhar, his wife, Vimala Devi, and his other child, Jyoti, 21, also work long hours at intensive jobs, leaving them with only so much time and energy to interact with the Nikki and Arvind afterward. Vimala Devi and Jyoti each work at a garment factory in Okhla. Vimala Devi makes Rs. 6,000 a month; Jyoti makes Rs. 7,000. They work from 8am until 8pm most days, leaving Nikki to do household chores in addition to their schoolwork.

""I come back late from work. I don't even have time to ask about her studies sometimes,"" says Vimala Devi of Nikki.

Vimala Devi passed through only eighth grade; Chandrashekhar didn't make it past Class 5. Jyoti, who makes a strong effort to help her siblings, had to quit school during Class 8.

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty. She now plays the role of a surrogate parent to her siblings.

The end of a dream

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty.

""I always wanted to study and become 'something', 'someone',"" she recollects. ""From the seventh grade, I knew I wanted to become a doctor. My mom used to fall ill often, you see? So I wanted to treat her.""

This dream ended in 2008 when her father fell ill with multiple masses in his kidneys. She was in seventh grade. The family had to leave their small village in Uttar Pradesh for Delhi so that her father could seek treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

""When we moved to Delhi, we soon realised that we could not afford the expenses if I did not work too,"" says Jyoti. She joined her mother at a factory making, she says, ""chamkeeli things"", shiny trinkets that were decorated with small mirrors and sequins.

""I remember having to beg her boss to give me a job as well,"" says Jyoti. ""I was not 14 yet, so it was illegal to employ me. Saab finally relented and allowed me to work there, helping with some of the handiwork, for around Rs. 1,200 per month. They used to make me hide in boxes or send me out to play at the time of inspections.""

Though the new job meant that Jyoti could support her parents and siblings, it also meant that she would never become a doctor.

""Now I try to live out my dreams by playing a doctor at home when somebody falls ill,"" Jyoti says. ""Even when neighbours fall ill, I talk to the doctors about it and then prescribe the medicines they suggest.""

Though many parents realize that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns.

The financial straits of Chandrashekhar's family is typical of other families in the pahadi school. The average household income is about Rs.10,000 to Rs. 20,000 a month, according to Sonu Nijhawan, the vice principal.

Teachers say they regularly see how the academic futures of their students are thwarted by the poverty of their families.

""One instance that I will never forget is that of Madhu,"" says Neelam Sanjeeta Minj, the teacher who is in charge of the school's management committee. ""One of our bright students, though she had only secured a 68% in her tenth grade. Her family was originally from a village in Rajasthan, and her father worked as a halwai here in Delhi. She had to discontinue her studies and go back to her village because her father was not earning enough to sustain a family here in Delhi. I still remember her crying.""

Much though many parents realise that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns. For poorer families, it often must be sacrificed.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" Jyoti says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study.""

Wondering about the future

""Hum toh padh nahin paye, humare bache to padhe (We were not able to study, but we would like our kids to study)."" This belief, according to Minj, is the driving force behind many success stories of kids whose ""stubborn"" parents insisted they get an education.

Jyoti is largely uneducated herself, works a difficult job, and comes home exhausted. Still, she has intuited what Minj learned from experience, and is determined, as a kind of surrogate parent, to provide her siblings with the unflagging attention and support that they need.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" she says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study... I sometimes yell at them when I see them squander away the opportunity given to them by goofing around. You are allowed to play, of course, but you need to study.""

Nikki dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If she succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances.

Nikki has noticed her sister's efforts. ""'Padhle (study) Nikki, padhle.' This is something you will hear often in this house,"" she says. She dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If Nikki succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances. A senior secondary school teacher in Delhi government schools can make as much as Rs. 55,000 a month.

Nikki's teachers say that she is receiving high marks, but getting that job at a government school wouldn't be easy: she'd have to complete an MA and BEd in Hindi and pass an additional set of tests even to be considered.

Jyoti has devoted herself to the difficult task of supporting the education of her siblings. But she is also acutely aware of how different Nikki's future might be different from her own. The eldest child wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn't dropped out of school.

""My siblings, especially the youngest brother, call me uneducated at times,"" Jyoti says. ""It is usually when I insist he go finish his homework or schoolwork. But when he calls me 'unpadh', I get angry, upset, all at once. I sometimes take it out on my parents. I ask them why they let their other kids study, but did not send me to school. I know it was not a choice they were happy making. It was something they were forced to do. But sometimes, I ask anyway."""
Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

"Breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women every year by 2020","Lack of early diagnosis of breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women a year by 2020, says a study, one of whose researchers is of Indian origin.

One of the most commonly diagnosed type of cancers among women in India, breast cancer claimed 70,218 lives in 2012, the study published in the Journal of Business Research showed. It also revealed that the average age of death from the disease has shifted from 50 years to 30 years.

The magnitude of the problem is enormous and has major policy implications for the Indian government, said Vijay Pereira, Associate Dean (Research) at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. Pereira said there were complex challenges at national, state and community levels.

“What is clear is that healthcare at state-level must transform to deliver quality care and awareness,” Pereira said. The researchers found lack of awareness about self-examination and cultural barriers played a major role. Women sought medical care extremely late. Women do not get access to health services and are reluctant to consult male doctors, neglecting their health due to family obligations. They are over-dependent on other family members. All of these cause delay in diagnosis, the researchers said.

Thus, educating Indian men about the significance of early diagnosis for breast cancer, could be the key to halt the disease which is turning into an epidemic, the researchers suggested. “India is still a patriarchal society. Although women are now in responsible jobs and earning for their families, it’s the men who are the head of the household,” said Judith Fletcher-Brown, from the University of Portsmouth in England.

Even educated professional women do not discuss private matters about their bodies with their husbands, fathers or brothers. So it’s essential to direct health messages towards men, Fletcher-Brown said.

Rapid economic development and greater urbanisation are also responsible for the rise in breast cancer rates, the researchers noted. Besides, women tend to have children at a later age and breast feeding is less, which increases their chances of developing the disease. Working women in urban India often have a more western diet leading to obesity. That also increases the risk. The study said community health nurses had the greatest impact in raising awareness of early breast cancer symptoms. In addition, schools and media were also found to be good channels through which awareness could be raised in young women.

WWE’s ‘developmental’ brand NXT proves future is now in SummerSlam 2017,"The end of NXT Takeover: Brooklyn on Sunday was symbolic for the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in many ways. Drew McIntyre defeated Bobby Roode to become the new NXT champion.

McIntyre was then attacked by the trio of Adam Cole, Kyle O’Reilly and Bobby Fish to close the show.

The aforementioned wrestlers all come from different backgrounds and have different styles of fighting but the common factor between them is that they have all joined the WWE in the last one year.

On top of that, all were established superstars in the independent scene before coming to the company.

This has been the trend for WWE in the last couple of years. From the moment they decided to make NXT like a third brand, there has been an influx of veterans from other promotions.

From former New Japan Pro Wrestling’s IWGP champion Shinshuke Nakamura to Ring of Honor and Impact Wrestling legend Samoa Joe, all the big names have proved their mettle in the ‘developmental’ division of the WWE.

This arrangement has been quite beneficial to both the brand and the wrestlers. With the influx of such talent, NXT became a must-watch show for wrestling fans. It also gave the wrestlers who were new to the company guaranteed screen time.

“My experience at NXT was quite stellar. Being part of such a revolutionary atmosphere helps you grow as a wrestler and it helped me adjust to the WWE style of wrestling,” Samoa Joe told HT.

READ | Samoa Joe says NXT stint helped him adjust to WWE’s style of wrestling

The last five NXT champions - Drew McIntyre, Bobby Roode, Shinshuke Nakamura, Samoa Joe and Finn Balor - were all well-known in their own right when they came to WWE. That itself shows how influential their role has been in taking the NXT brand to the next level.

The youngsters in the division have also benefited a lot from these veterans and the result was evident in the WWE Summerslam card; it featured NXT alumni in almost all of the matches.

‘Third brand, not developmental’

When asked about his experience in NXT, this is what former New Japan Pro Wrestling sensation Finn Balor told HT. “When I joined NXT, many people criticized them for not putting me a former NJPW champion in their so-called lower brand.

“But, it is actually a third brand for the company and personally, I believe NXT helped me to improve my game by a huge margin before my main roster debut.”

NXT founder Paul “Triple H” Levesque believes that it has been a two-way street as the company has benefited from the presence of the big indie-wrestling superstars. Similarly, the wrestlers have also taken valuable lessons from NXT that helped their careers in the long run.

“They’ve got a lot of experience and been a lot of places, but no one has taught them how to do television; no one has taught them camera angles or the subtleties and even from the storytelling standpoint of what we do bell to bell,” Levesque told USA Today in an interview.

“We shoot a television show with a backdrop that happens to be the WWE Universe, a WWE ring and the competitors work in that ring, but it’s still a television show.

“Nobody is doing the things that what we’re doing in terms of the difference in the product. No matter where you come from, you have to learn that and have that learning curve,” he added."
"Chipmaker Nvidia, Volvo, AutoLiv team up to develop self-driving vehicles by 2021","Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Monday announced it was partnering with Volvo Cars and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv to develop self-driving car technology for vehicles due to hit the market by 2021.

Volvo is owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd .

The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving.

Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain” of the autonomous vehicle.

The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG’s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.

In a call with reporters, Nvidia’s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.

The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia’s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called “Level 3” driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.

Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its “Drive Me” autonomous pilot program.

Volvo’s production vehicles built on Nvidia’s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021."
THE CLASS OF 2018: Why doesn't this co-ed school have any girl students?,"The Government Co-education Secondary School in Naya Bazaar, is 'co-ed' only in name. In the seven years since the school moved into its new building, a girl is yet to seek admission.

Co-education schools are a rarity in Delhi's government school system, accounting for a mere 17 per cent of the city's 1,009 schools in 2015. Most of the remaining schools are run in two shifts, where girls study in the morning and boys in the afternoon.

Educationists are increasingly convinced of the importance of boys and girls studying together from a young age; particularly in a city like Delhi where violence against women is common, and most young men and women live in gender-segregated spaces.

""Any project where homogeneity is brought about artificially can never prepare students for challenges they will face in society,"" said Minati Panda, chairperson of Zakir Husain Center for Educational Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

So why don't girls study at the Naya Bazaar school?

The history of this school building offers an insight into not just the constraints of Delhi's school system, but a perspective on how girls and young women are pushed out of public spaces almost by default.

The building at Naya Bazaar began as a government girls school. But in 2004, the building was closed for repairs and the students and staff were shifted to the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Pul Bangash.

In 2009, a co-ed school in the Bara Hindu Rao neighbourhood had to be moved to make way for flyover.

""I am not sure what happened to the girl students in Bara Hindu Rao, but when I came here in 2012, the school already had only boys as students,"" said Gauri Shankar, the principal at Naya Bazaar.

The gender balance, Shankar said is further skewed by the fact that three of Naya Bazaar's feeder schools are boys school at the primary level. ""We are ready to give admission to girls but most of them go to Pul Bangash school as this school is in the middle of market area.""

Now, no parent wants their girls to go to a school full of boys.

""I didn't know if Rahul's school was co-ed,"" said Pawan Gautam, whose son studies at the school, ""There are no girls in his school, so I didn't want to send my daughters there.""

Only 17% of Delhi's 1009 are co-educational by default, rather than design.

Why so many single-sex schools?

Most of Delhi's schools are single sex by default rather than design. The primary reason, officials from the department of education said, is this allows the department to run two schools from the same building.

""The population of Delhi has increased many-fold, and we have to create opportunities for these students,"" said Saumya Gupta, director education. ""Girls go the morning shift as you can't ask parents to send girls in the evening, and boys come in the evening.""

Officials said many parents prefer to send their daughters to a girls' school.

""Most of our schools are decades old and maybe at that time locals demanded their daughters to be sent to a girls school,"" said an official, who did not wish to be named. ""Such local conditions still exist in certain areas although we need to break these stereotypes.""

Yet, graduates from these schools wish for a more liberal education.

Amit Kumar, who studied at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Sangam Vihar, said he struggled to adjust at a co-ed college.

""I had almost negligible interaction with girls,"" he said. ""When I moved to college, it was a different world where boys and girls studied in the same classroom.""

""It was difficult to adjust and interact with the girls. Maybe if I was from a co-ed school it would have been easier to adjust.""

Experts agree.

""It is desirable to have co-education so that students can learn to engage with the opposite sex in a natural way while they are growing up,"" said Poonam Batra, a professor at the Delhi University's education department.

A 2014 study published in the journal 'Sex Roles', found that teachers in single-sex school tended to rationalise segregated schools on the basis that girls and boys learn differently, thereby perpetuating gender stereotypes.

The Department of Education insists that change is around the corner.

""We are opening 16 new schools in this academic session and all are co-ed,"" said Gupta, the education director.

But for now, Naya Bazar, the co-ed school that never had any girls, is being turned into a boys school, perpetuating a cycle that everyone in the department says they want to break out of."

PREVIEW

Sri Lanka are in total chaos. Their inability to score runs and take wickets have gone from bad to worse. The Sri Lankans lost the Test series 3-0 and were expected to match India in the limited overs version. But the heavy defeat in the first ODI in Dambulla exposed more than just poor performance in the hosts.

The Lankans are in turmoil. Their coach Nic Pothas has revealed that players are confused because “there are too many cooks” in the dressing room. Former skipper Mahela Jayawardene has said that the players have been gripped by the “fear of losing.” So the odds are heavily stacked against the home team

It’s time the Lankans redeemed themselves. Sri Lanka could seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 and for that the 1996 world champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies. The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30."
Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.

Sri Lanka cricket hurting from fear of failure: Mahela Jayawardene,"Mahela Jayawardene, former Sri Lanka captain, feels the fear of failure is impeding the growth of the Sri Lankan cricket team, which is currently being outplayed by India in an ongoing series.

Sri Lanka’s heavy loss to India in the three-match Test series came after the island nation lost the five-match ODI series against minnows Zimbabwe 2-3.

“I feel the team’s confidence is low. The fear of failure factor has come out. They don’t look confident, they don’t look hungry enough in the middle. They need to address that and find solutions very quickly,” Jayawardene told Cricinfo.

Talking about the whitewash against India, Jayawardene said the team failed in all departments.

“I am sure the guys would be very disappointed with their performance in the Test series. It was a great challenge for them to test themselves against the number one team.

“They didn’t handle certain situations well. First innings batting too let them down when there were no demon in the wickets. They also never looked like getting 20 wickets,” said the former Sri Lankan captain.

Jayawardene, however, was all praise for India captain Virat Kohli, who guided his team to an eighth consecutive Test series win.

“Look he is a pro active captain. He is very aggressive. He has a brilliant record to start with, though most of the games were played din India, you still have to win matches.

“He has led the team from the front so the rest of the boys are following on and off the field. The Test for them now will be playing away from home.

“They have created a good nucleus of players who are taking responsibility. There is good competition for batting and bowling positions,” he said.

The Sri Lanka great was all praise for Hardik Pandya too. “He is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side.

“You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.”

His value is no less as a fast bowler, said Jayawardene. “He has given India the combination they were craving for. To have five bowlers with three quicks and two spinners. It lends a nice balance to the side,” he added."

Abandoned bunkers of 1962 Indo-China war attract tourists to Nelong Valley,"Far from the latest Sino-India standoff in the eastern border, Uttarakhand’s Nelong Valley along the border with China continues to attract discerning travellers to its picturesque Ladakh-type landscape and abandoned bunkers of the 1962 Chinese aggression.

Perched at around 11,000 feet close to the China border, the valley lies in the Gangotri National Park area in Uttarkashi district - around 315 km from Dehradun.

Once a buzzing hotspot for the Indo-Tibet trade, the valley was closed for civilians and tribals residing in villages were shifted out from there at the time of the 1962 Sino-India war.

Though the battle did not play out in this region, bunkers were erected in the valley from the security point of view, local experts say.

The valley then remained out of bounds for civilians for over five decades post the 1962 war, before a part of it was ultimately reopened by the Uttarakhand government for tourists in 2015.

“No longer in use, these bunkers in the open-for-civilians-area of the valley are now attracting tourists...visitors feel very excited to set foot in the abandoned bunkers and to get a feel of how the soldiers would have survived during the harsh, climatic conditions,” said Tilak Soni, an Uttarkashi-based adventure and tourism expert who strove for the reopening of the valley.

Vinod Panwar, who visited the Valley recently, said: “The entire valley is like a thrilling surprise package, tucked in the Himalayas…but I especially enjoyed peeking inside an old bunker dotted along the route, getting the feel of a soldier’s life.”

Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava said over 464 tourists have visited the valley since April this year, which is “double the number from the last year”.

Almost 90% of the tourists applied for the special permit (which is required for visiting the valley) online through a single window clearance system introduced by the district administration in April this year.

Underlining the valley’s numerous attractions, including the bunkers and an intricate wooden bridge that was used by locals for Indo-Tibet trade prior to the war, Srivastava said, “We are planning to develop the entire region from heritage tourism point of view and to offer a whole range of interpretation about different attractions of the Valley to further enhance tourists’ experience.”"
Partition-1947 movie review: If it wasn’t Lord Mountbatten then who divided India?,"Partition 1947

Cast: Hugh Bonneville, Gillian Anderson, Manish Dayal, Huma Qureshi, Michael Gambon

Director: Gurinder Chadha

Rating: 2.5/5

History is written by the victors.

In the 340-room opulent Delhi house lives master of the country’s fate Lord Mountbatten, who has no clue about what’s going inside it. Seemingly a misfit for the job, he has arrived in India to finalise its partition into two states, one for Hindus and Sikhs and the other for Muslims.

Riots have already broken and thousands have been killed in Punjab and Bengal province, and thus Viceroy Mountbatten wants to get over with the physical division of the border as soon as possible. Little does he know that he is just a pawn in a much bigger scheme of things orchestrated by Winston Churchill years ago! In fact, somebody in the film says this in as many words, ‘Churchill had a vision.’

Visionary or not, Churchill, of course, plays an important part in Gurinder Chadha’s film, which heavily borrows from a couple of books including Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins’ Freedom At Midnight.

There are spoilers ahead.

The idea is to develop a theory around a war document of 1945, which brings out Churchill and thus England’s overall aggressive policy towards South Asia. As per Viceroy’s House, titled Partition 1947 in Hindi, the great Indian dissection was a tactic to restrict the Russian influence in the mineral oil zone. It would have given our old, tyrant masters a firm chance to control Jinnah’s Pakistan and thus its neighbour Afghanistan. Apparently, it was much more difficult to lead Jawaharlal Nehru and his futuristic policies in the same way.

All this is known to the audience way before Louis Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville, Robert Crawley in TV series Downton Abbey), who despite being the King’s relative knows nothing about the imperial policies. His anger and grief after realising how he has been played soon transform into a volatile remorse, which makes him more human towards the Indians and the local culture.

When Michael Gambon’s Lord Ismay tells him that he and nobody else is the chief architect of India’s division because the arrangement is called the Mountbatten plan then, for a moment, you might take his side. After all, he is just a poor war veteran, who, along with Lady Edwina Mountbatten (Gillian Anderson), is running an outreach programme in the Indian capital for poor, sufferers and people who eat with their hands.

In short, his blissful ignorance of a conspiracy of such high magnitude is the director’s ploy to shift the rage towards the players sitting in England rather than those who are getting the partition executed on the ground in India. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry when Cyril Radcliffe, the engineer of the Radcliffe line between India and Pakistan, says how this is his maiden India tour.

Feasibility aside, this points a finger towards the local leadership’s cluelessness towards the proceedings. How did Gandhi and Nehru miss it when Jinnah got it long before them? Then there is a conversation where Jinnah tells Mountbatten how they both wanted this to happen for their own interests.

But before that, Chadha exposes Jinnah’s high-handedness and his lust for a separate country.

The stories from the interiors of the Viceroy’s House come crawling out via some Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims working for Lord Mountbatten. Two of them are Jeet Kumar (Manish Dayal) and Aaliya (Huma Qureshi). Their history goes all the way to Lahore where Jeet helped Aaliya’s freedom fighter father(Om Puri in one of his last roles) in the prison. This partition is also a question mark on their future, safety and belief in a common culture in times of fanaticism.

At best a highlighted sidetrack, they never take the centre-stage as the pain of one of the biggest migrations in the history of mankind engulfs us all. From Lahore to Delhi, the ochre sky is filled with shrieks and stories of inhumanity except for Lord Mountbatten, who as per the film is still passionate about the safety and wellbeing of the Indians. What a wrong choice to carry out the divisive English plans!

You’ll also meet Gandhi ji (Neeraj Kabi) who forces Mountbatten to taste his curd made of goat’s milk, or some Cambridge-educated gentlemen who are no less refined than the English lords. A couple of AR Rahman tunes enhance the mood here and there, but fail to contribute anything significant to Chadha’s version of the Indian partition.

In 106 minutes, Gurinder Chadha ably paints the anxiety and painful relocation of millions on the both sides of the border. Her handling or rather handing out a clean chit to England’s last Viceroy to India seems over-simplification of the historic episode though.

McDonald’s to start cutting antibiotic use in its global chicken supply in 2018,"McDonald’s Corp on Wednesday said that it would begin curbing the use of the high value human antibiotics in its global chicken supply in 2018, as the fast-food giant joins a broad effort to battle dangerous superbugs.

McDonald’s, in a policy statement, said it is working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens.

McDonald’s is requiring suppliers of chicken meat to begin phasing out the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization as “highest priority critically important antimicrobials” (HPCIA) to human medicine.

Public health and consumer groups applauded the move, which is not as strict as the company’s policy for the United States, where already for a year suppliers have provided the chain with chickens raised without antibiotics deemed important to human health.

In January 2018, HPCIAs will be gone from McDonald’s chickens in Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe. Only in Europe the company will make an exception for Colistin, a last resort antibiotic.

By the end of 2019, suppliers in Australia and Russia will stop using HPCIAs and European suppliers plan to remove Colistin.

Suppliers in all other markets will comply by January 2027.

“Our goal is to have this policy implemented before this date,” McDonald’s said in its posted antibiotic policy update.

McDonald’s told a group of consumer and environmental organizations on Aug. 17 that 74% of its global chicken sales will conform to this policy as of January 2018, Consumers Union, the policy division of Consumer Reports, said in a statement.

Consumers Union also said the company told the group that it hopes to have a timeline soon for reducing medically important antibiotics from its beef supply.

McDonald’s declined comment on sales figures and its plans for beef.

More than 70% of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.

“If fully implemented, (the plans) could be a total game changer that could transform the marketplace given the company’s massive buying power,” Jean Halloran, Consumers Union’s director of food policy initiatives, said in a statement."

"Why no one remembers Delhi’s Gudiya, raped and left with bottle inside her","A five-year-old gang-rape victim was found with candles and plastic bottles in her body in April 2013. Four years later, she is still fighting a lonely battle to bring her perpetrators to justice.

The minor, who came to be known as Gudiya, was held captive by a neighbour who raped and brutalised her. Coming on the heels of the infamous December 16 gang-rape of a paramedical student, the incident evoked widespread outrage.

Political leaders such as Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, the then health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, senior BJP leader Vijay Goel, made a beeline for seeing the child battling for her life at AIIMS.

From the archives: Delhi minor rape victim’s condition improving, say doctors

“Initially, we got support from everywhere. But after six months, we were left alone. We have been running from pillar to post to get justice. No compensation was paid and no job was offered despite promises. Somehow, we managed to get Gudiya admitted in a Gurgaon school with the help of a journalist when the government did not help,” said Gudiya’s father.

Delhi Commission for Women chairperson, Swati Jaihind, promised to look into the case on being asked about what was being done for Gudiya. “”This is reflective of how the system is working and how a rape survivor has to suffer. We need to build an effective rehabilitation policy for survivors where the state supports the survivor in leading her life,” Jaihind said.

Delhi minor rape: unfolding of events

The family complained that despite four years having passed since the incident, the case is still on trial at Karkardooma court and one accused was set free after being in a correction home for some time as he was a juvenile.

“We have challenged the court judgment declaring one of the accused as juvenile. The investigating officer is to be examined. The case initially got all the attention. People were standing with us but now we are pursuing the matter alone except some help from Kailash Satyarthi’s organisation,” said Gudiya’s paternal uncle.

To strengthen their fight, Gudiya’s family has joined hands with relatives of child sexual abuse victims from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab, Bihar, and Delhi to support Nobel peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s countrywide march — Bharat Yatra. The move aims to create awareness about child rape, sexual harassment, and trafficking.

The yatra, which starts on September 11 from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, will pass through 22 states and cover 15,000 kilometres in about 35 days. It also plans to engage about one crore people and sensitise law enforcement agencies handling such cases.

Satyarthi said his yatra is war against child sexual abuse and trafficking in the country. “I refuse to accept that the innocence, smiles and freedom of our children can keep getting stripped and raped. These are not ordinary crimes. This is a moral epidemic haunting our nation,” he said."
"Virat Kohli open to transition talk with Sri Lanka, but only after series","He is open to the idea of discussing Sri Lanka cricket team’s transitional issues with their coach Nic Pothas, but Indian cricket team skipper Virat Kohli will only do it once he is done with the ongoing limited-overs series.

Virat Kohli was asked about Pothas’ comment that they would interact with the Indian team management to overcome the transition period difficulties their team is facing currently.

“We haven’t had any discussions yet. Those things may happen after the competitive zone is over and done with the series. I think that will happen after September 6 if it has to happen from their end,” Kohli said at the pre-match press conference here today.

The hosts’ team bus was subject of angry reaction from fans at Dambulla after the heavy defeat in the first ODI.

Kohli spoke about how India managed the transition phase after many of their own greats retired.

“...But look it is difficult for any team going through transition. One thing that we decided to do as a team was take more responsibility and ownership of what we do on the field when playing for the country. We just needed to change our mindset.”

Mental preparation was key to standing upto challenges, according to the captain.

“It didn’t matter if we were playing against a side that has played 60 Tests each – if we are mentally more prepared than them then we are in a better position to win. So we decided to put our heads in that zone where experience didn’t matter much for us.

“It was the fight and competitiveness we were willing to show and the desire to fight for longer periods that helped us get through that phase quicker than what others might have faced,” said the skipper.

Kohli said extreme reactions from fans are beyond the players’ control and they would rather focus on the task at hand only.

“I’m not someone who will sit here after not performing and request the fans to be patient with us or (tell them) ‘please don’t react in a bad way’. That’s a very personal choice.

“If I, as a fan, am watching a game and I see a team not being able to do well I would feel compassion. I would not burn effigies or smash faces, put on mannequins and what not. I would show compassion because you can understand at a human level that everyone’s trying hard out there and no one wants to go out there to lose or fail.”

The Indian captain added, “I think people find the ease and convenience, and the pleasure in pulling other people down which I personally don’t believe in.

“I’m sure it’s tough for the players to see such things. But you can’t really control what’s happening from another person, you can only control what you can do on the park and the mindset that you can be in,” he added.

Last but not the least, the topic of Lasith Malinga also came up as he is seen by many as a fading star in this young and inexperienced Sri Lankan line-up.

Asked about Malinga, Kohli said, “Obviously, age is always a factor in sport. I cannot speak for Lasith but everyone wants to keep up with their peak fitness and manage their bodies well through the course of their career. When you look at his bowling action and the kind of success he has had for such a long period of time is actually remarkable.

“With the dynamics of his bowling, it’s not very natural. What he has been able to achieve for Sri Lanka has been outstanding. That’s why they have been such a dangerous side over the last few years in limited overs format,” said Kohli.

The skipper felt Malinga could still get back into his groove.

“Even when he played Test cricket, he made an impact. It’s very easy to say that he is not bowling as well anymore but it could just be a phase. Once he starts hitting those yorkers again, those slower balls again, and picks up wickets on a regular basis then these talks can be otherwise also.

“I can’t talk about his body, only he would know. But as long as we play him we obviously respect his skills and what he can bring to the table and how he can turn the game around.

“We always play him like that, we have always played him like that and we’ll continue to play him like that till he plays for Sri Lanka,” Kohli signed off."

"Congress’s Kisan Sammelan to test its unity, poll readiness for 2018","Congress’s Kisan Sammelan (farmers’ convention) in Lahaar of Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district, close to Gwalior, will signal its readiness for the 2018 assembly polls and also whether the party’s ‘Dabra’ spirit can be revived.

The ‘Dabra’ spirit is the holy grail for Congress unity. In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.

The parallels are obvious. The ‘show’ at Laahar will be Madhavrao’s son, Jyotiraditya’s, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.

The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.

Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singh’s constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.

Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, “Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.”

Loud and Visible

The preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.

Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.

Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindia’s rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.

Tapping into Farmers’ Anger

With the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers’ crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.

There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.

State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers’ issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. “It started with Scindiaji’s satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.”

After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singh’s constituency.

BJP puts up brave front

The BJP too realises the Congress’s game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers’ anger through a slew of measures — visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.

The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.

BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.

“They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers,” he said."
A week of upsets at Wimbledon may signal the end of an era,"Rafael Nadal’s dreams of a third Wimbledon title were shattered on Monday when he lost in the fourth round to 26th-ranked Gilles Muller. Then, on Wednesday, two more former champions and tournament favourites – Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – went down to lower ranked players (Sam Querrey and Thomas Berdych, respectively). Murray and Djokovic were both thwarted by injuries, and Nadal, famous for his seemingly endless reserve of stamina, succumbed in the 28th game of the fifth set. Taken together, the three upsets – each one against a former champion now in his 30’s – may signal the coming of an end of an era in men’s tennis. To be sure, three upsets do not make a trend. And Roger Federer, the oldest of the Big 4, may yet manage to win his record eighth Wimbledon on Sunday. But a trove of data, compiled by sports statistician Jeff Sackman, also suggests that the previous decade of men’s tennis – characterized by a handful of top players’ domination of the field – may be very different from the years to come.

Upsets in Grand Slams In 2003, a 21-year-old Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title. The intervening years have been marked by near total dominance in the men’s field, with four players – Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray – winning 48 of the 56 Grand Slam tournaments. If it has been one of the greatest eras of men’s tennis, it has also been one of its most predictable. Since Federer first became Wimbledon champion, upsets have become increasingly rare in the men’s field. If we define an upset as a match in which the winner’s rank was at least 10 lower than the loser’s, we find that the frequency of Grand Slam upsets dropped from about 26% in 2003 to about 21% in 2016. Every year since 1991, upsets on the men’s side were more common on the women’s side. But in 2008, men’s upsets finally became less common than women’s, and have remained so ever since.

Federer wins his first Wimbledon 2009

Del Potro wins US Open 2014-15

Wawrinka wins Aus, French and US Open Men Women Year Upsets %

While it is possible that the trend will continue into the future, it is at least as likely that the coming years will see a regression to the mean. That is particularly true because the men who have dominated tennis for the last several years are getting too old to keep winning all the time.

Tennis is old The Big 4 have been dominating men's tennis for more than 10 years now. The youngest of the four is Novak Djokovic, who turned 30 in May. The oldest, Roger Federer, will be 36 in August. They are not only the best players on the tour right now, but also among the oldest. And it’s not just the Big 4 – the top 50 players are on an average older than they've been in the past 30 years. Women, too, are getting older. And as the top players have aged, younger players have had to wait longer to make it into the top ranks.

Riding the horse of life to death: Vijay Nambisan (1963-2017),"In the early 1990s in Bombay, poetry, or prose for that matter, was not about getting prizes. Or even being recognized in a bookshop or a restaurant. It was a defiant and dangerous personal vocation. Something like the helpless inner voice that urges a prospective Christ to climb his cross as a matter of course, and drive the first nail with his free hand.

Poetry was a romantic, seemingly interminable act of self sacrifice. First it required a measure of self abuse. Then with luck words came. And they would sound real. For better or worse, that has changed . Writing is a career now. A performance. A mime of the self. A frantic if studied method to hang on to what may not be there anytime now: an award, a fellowship, a flung nickel, an air ticket. And it involves one of the most tiring tasks an intelligent human can embark on: self promotion.

Vijay Nambisan was capable of neither. In one of Vijay’s prose works, Language as Ethic, he argues from the heart—and shores up those arguments from his phenomenal intellect — that at the core of communication is not even words and images, but integrity. Devoid of it, language assumes a political and manipulative nature. On the surface of it, the premise sounds like the plea of an honest man to all to be good. But it explains, typical of Vijay’s work, as in a flash, why a whole culture is incapable of facing up to truth at just about every level. And a people’s proneness to collective delusions.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry. Dom Moraes, Arun Kolatkar, Adil Jussawalla, Nissim Ezekiel, Eunice De Souza, Jeet Thayyil to name a few. In my perception, at that time, among the senior poets Dom was closer to youngsters like us than the others. Dom was particularly encouraging of Jeet, Vijay, and me, regular visitors to Dom’s residence in Sargent House, Allana Road, Colaba.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations – like writer-poet Dom Moraes (left) and publisher David Davidar– who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry.

Dom had written, perhaps excessively kind, introductions and blurbs for the three of us, and recommended us to David Davidar, who published the now landmark Penguin Gemini series. As far as I can recall — and there is not much I am able to forget — most of us were on some mood altering substance or the other most of the time, and had a certain contempt for what Vijay described as the Corporate Poet. And he did not mean just poet. He was against suits, boots, hats. And an equal measure of contempt for time; why else would we all try so desperately to fast-forward our clocks?

One of the accidental meeting points of the younger lot of poets was the Debonair magazine, whose office then was in Worli, housed in an unpretentious building. It would be always hot inside. And then there would be areas where it was wintry. The air conditioning was uneven. At the time, Anil Dharker was running it, and, like a classic literary editor, he was open to new writers. The poetry editor for a while, if I recall correctly, was Imtiaz Dharker.

When Dharker quit, Adil Jussawalla took over. It was at this time that I first met Vijay. I had gone there, mid-morning, to follow up on an article; Vijay was in Adil’s cabin. He saw me and came out, grinning like he had met a cousin long lost. We went down to the bar round the corner and had a few. Sometime in the twilight hours, we parted, and all I could take away from that meeting was that I was supposed to meet him the next morning, at his paying guest room, close by.

I went, nursing the by now familiar hangover, and knocked on the door. Vijay opened it, but his face had undergone drastic restructuring. The night before he had fallen flat down the stairs on his chin, and was lighter for three or four teeth. There was blood on the stairs. I went back, in search of phantoms similar to Vijay. But could not find too many — even over the years.

I mention these details of the inner workings in the literary alleys of Bombay of that rather unchronicled decade because Vijay stuck to that life, took several more falls. Lost more than his teeth.

The others moved on or tried to move from that unforgiving, transgressive life, in which words had to be bought with a little bit of life in exchange, an unsustainable trade.

Vijay bought into solitude, sometimes hating it, sometimes, choice-less, loving it. It gave him, I imagine, a martyr’s identity. He was the knight of poetry, and he was going to ride the horse of life to death. The smarter among his friends veered away from that track.

Through it all, Vijay wrote. Not much, but a little that said a lot. For him it was hard to separate a way of living from a way of writing. To create, he had to destroy. And his own body seemed the closest at hand.

He knew what he was doing. And, to me, it felt like a kind of vengeance. I was not sure vengeance against what. Most likely against himself. Between suicide and murder, he would choose the first. He knew his ways of life hurt people who loved him the most; his family; his very caring wife, Dr Kaveri Nambisan, a fine novelist herself. A few times, he went off alcohol; but he unerringly came back to, as he puts in a different contest, in Reminders of Gain : The call of the arrow/Summons the bow//

There are the usual articles doing the rounds that Vijay was a recluse. That word is a much-prostituted one in literary descriptions because it is used as if reclusion is a kind of extreme glamour of the eccentric. But then this is a place where the press described him as “the first all India poetry champion in 1988.”

The truth was that Vijay was dysfunctional. The only place he could be himself and find a transcendental value was in the world of words. He was close to a few people. That kept shifting. For a while, or so I think, he was quite my comrade in arms; in alms, too. The early years in Bombay for instance. Then we drifted. In his later phase, he was perhaps close to Jeet.

In between, I moved to Pune to head the Times of India’s edition there. Vijay and Kaveri had taken up a house in Lonavla, where he said the “clouds passed through his head, if he opened the window.” I never did make it to Lonavla.

In the car from office to my house once, Vijay said, “You have become a different man.” All the while I wondered how to tuck him in bed, given his slightly accusatory mood. This was around the time he had done a rare, cadenced translation of selected portions of Poonthanam’s Jnana Paana, (Song of Wisdom).

Poonthanam was a great 16th century Bhakti poet who more or less wrote the rules of the Malayalam language and literature. He was a devotee of Krishna, especially after the accidental death of his infant child. Poothanam’s rival in Krishna bhakti was Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, a rather superior — he was one of India’s first astronomers, and he was a great mathematician and linguist as well — brahmin who wrote, Narayaneeyam in Sanskrit. Poothanam’s work made literature accessible to the Malayalee non-brahmin. One of the great questions in Malayalam literature has been: Which work is better? Or which works better?

When Vijay said he was going to translate these ancient poets to English, I remember asking him, who’s going to read it. Vijay asked for some salt. Because he sweated a lot, he would mix salt in alcohol. It was all quite scientific at one level. I got him salt. He blew some smoke in my direction and grinned his famous grin. He didn’t care. That’s what he meant. The market did not enter into the world of his words. His integrity was a voice that he could ever rely on to impel him to triumphs and disasters.

Later, he said the translation was no easy job. Though Vijay, like quite a few IIT-ians, had a photographic memory, he was not fluent in reading or writing Malayalam, even though he asserted his provenance and ethnicity wherever possible.

What he did was to ask his father — who, when I met him once at his home in Bangalore, seemed both proud and worried about his prodigal son — for literal translations and then trans-created it beautifully into rhythmic wisdom.

Consider the opening lines of his work: “O yesterday the things we did not know would come!/And O the things we do not know will come today!/Now we behold those soon pass away!/ We are not told how long they’ll stay with us”.

There is a touch of Hamlet here: “There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come — the readiness is all.”

At the time when the book came out, it was mostly criticized for his self-confessed ignorance of the vernacular, and his own agnosticism. To my mind, it was a spectacular act of literary courage, though not easy to distinguish from self indulgence, and dare.

Through it all Vijay drank. Went into detox. Came out. Wrote. Smoked. He smoked, I had often thought, as an antidote to alcohol. It was a break from what he was doing to his liver. For this, he had to destroy his throat and lungs. Either way, he would pay a price.

He paid it. Because the rest of the world of his 90s had changed. They had become gentrified. All the more reason he had to stay the course. He was the last man standing. What he thought of the change he said a few years ago in Outlook: “Eighteen of the happiest months in my life were spent in rural Bihar. It may sound like reverse snobbery, but I can’t help that. My wife and I were honoured members of the community, no one tried or wanted to shoot us, and the nuns looked after us like friends. What more could we want? A Learjet?”

This was the stay that went into the writing of his funny and insightful work: Bihar is in the Eye of the Beholder. It explained, as perhaps only a poet could, the intricate workings of a place that failed to work. And still survived like a trick that explained the tawdry magic of India. This book too was commissioned by David Davidar of Penguin, with whom Vijay had a productive relationship.

That’s saying a lot. Vijay’s ties changed with the tides of his mind. People betrayed him, by just not calling him up. In his mind, and I believe he is right, he was one of the few genuine artistes who deserved recognition, but would do nothing outside the covers of his books, to wangle it.

His latest collection, which was released last year, First Infinities, has some remarkable poems. It was perhaps justly brought out by an alternative publishing house, Hemant Diwate’s Poetrywala. Some of the poems suffer from a certain vulnerability to fall into the rhymes and rhythms, which take the poet away from the place he intended to end up in when he set out. But more often than not, the music ends in notes you did not think resided in them. It’s only the fine permutation of the words that makes possible a beauty which was not there till Vijay thought it up:

Snow

Crisp in the winter’s morning,

Softly all through the night,

What is this without warning,

Falling and white?

I have never seen snow

But I can imagine it quite –

Not how it tastes, but I know

It falls and is white.

One morning I’ll open the door

To bring in the morning’s milk,

And all around there’ll be snow –

Fallen and still.

How I’ll roll in the stuff!

How I’ll tumble and spin!

Until the neighbours cry, Enough!

And send me back in.

These are times when people die to live. Vijay lived to die. And write. I am glad I walked part of the way with him. He was the light. And he burnt furiously while he was there.

UK to ban sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040,"Britain on Wednesday it will outlaw the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040 in a bid to cut air pollution but environmental groups said the proposals did not go far enough.

Environment minister Michael Gove announced the move as part of the government’s keenly-awaited 3 billion pounds (USD 3.9 billion, 3.4 billion euro) air pollution plan, which will demand that councils propose measures by March next year to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.

The ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as vans follows a similar proposal by the French government, and will also include hybrid vehicles that have an electric motor and a petrol or diesel engine.

“The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to ensure that by 2050 there would be no diesel or petrol vehicles on the road and today we’re confirming that should mean no new diesel or petrol vehicles by 2040,” Gove told BBC Radio 4.

Britain’s High Court demanded that the government produce plans to tackle illegal NO2 pollution, largely caused by diesel emissions, and a draft report was published in May, but the full report was delayed by last month’s snap general election.

The government will provide local councils with 255 million pounds to bring NO2 levels to legal levels, with possible solutions including the removal of speed humps, reprogramming traffic lights and changing road layouts.

Campaigners want cities to impose entry fees on diesel drivers, but councils will only be allowed to do so if no other measures are available, with ministers wary of “punishing” drivers of cars who bought their vehicles in good faith, according to media reports.

“Diesel drivers are not to blame and, to help them switch to cleaner vehicles, the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme, one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans,” a government spokesman said.

Gove added that he did not believe “that it is necessary to bring in charging.”

Campaign group ClientEarth warned that health issues “caused by exposure to illegal air pollution are happening now, so we need urgent action.”

Fellow campaigners Greenpeace also warned that the plans did not do enough to combat the immediate issue of NO2 pollution in cities

“While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” said Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK.

“Providing a long term vision is not enough, (Michael) Gove still needs protect our health right now from toxic fumes polluting our streets.”

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that the move could cost jobs.

“Currently demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles is growing but still at a very low level as consumer have concern over affordability, range and charging points,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

“Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, we could undermine the UK’s successful automotive sector if we don’t allow enough time for the industry to adjust.”

Air pollution contributes to the death of more than 40,000 people per year in Britain, according to official figures, with nitrogen dioxide a particular problem.

Norway, which is aiming to end the use of all cars running on fossil fuels by 2025, offers generous tax breaks for electric vehicles as well as free parking and the use of bus lanes."
Akila Dananjaya bamboozles India in Pallekele ODI but doesn’t have last laugh,"Akila Dananjaya added his name to Sri Lanka’s list of unorthodox bowlers with a stunning display that left Indian batsmen reeling in the second One-day International at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.

The 23-year-old captured six wickets in 20 deliveries to leave India, one moment cruising to another easy win, hurtling towards defeat. He eventually finished with six fo 54 as India fought back to win by three wickets.

Dananjaya was drafted into the side as one of three changes by a Sri Lankan team management desperate to arrest the slide in India’s current tour, and responded brilliantly. Interestingly, he got married on Wednesday and joined the team late in the night.

The bowler dishes out a variety of off-break, leg-break and googly, and the Indian batsmen were done in mainly by his well-controlled googly. India, 103 for none chasing 231 in 47 overs, were reduced to 131 for seven at one stage.

Rohit Sharma (lbw) was beaten by a leg-break while Kedar Jadhav (bowled), Virat Kohli (bowled) and KL Rahul (bowled) were all cleaned by by googlies in a sensational 18th over of the innings.

Dananjaya completed his maiden ODI five-wicket haul when he had all-rounder Hardik Pandya stumped for a duck, also off a googly as the batsman tried to get to the pitch of the ball.

The versatile bowler was a controversial pick for Sri Lanka’s 2012 World Cup, after being recommended by skipper Mahela Jayawardene despite not having played any professional cricket. However, he was subsequently ignored, which explains his playing only three ODIs in all until Thursday.

India crushed the hosts by nine wickets in the first game at Dambulla on Sunday and an opposition in disarray gives Virat Kohli and the team management another opportunity to fine-tune performances with the 2019 World Cup the target.

India will be particularly high on confidence returning to a venue where they clinched the final Test in three days to achieve their first-ever Test series sweep away from home. Besides, they also won the only ODI they played in Pallekele, which is just off Kandy.

WORLD CUP BERTH

Sri Lanka, who have barely competed against India on this tour and lost the Test series 0-3, are under pressure on three fronts. They have to win two matches in the five-game series if they are to pip West Indies and claim the eighth direct spot for the World Cup by the September 30 deadline.

Virat Kohli’s aim before the series was to give players opportunities and test others in specific roles. Among batsmen, Rohit Sharma will look to make amends for his early run out in Dambulla while in-form KL Rahul, who didn’t get to bat in that game, will be eager to get a hit.

The skipper hit an unbeaten 82 while opener Shikhar Dhawan struck 132 not out.

All-rounder Hardik Pandya is very much a work in progress as an ODI pace bowler and could continue to open the bowling. India will need all the pacers to be fit and ready to go in the next few months. And even Shardul Thakur would hope to get a game in the series.

Sri Lanka ODI skipper Upul Tharanga was hopeful his team will somehow find a way out and hinted there could be some changes in the line-up. Sri Lankan batsmen were guilty of playing rash shots, leaving their under-cooked bowling unit with just 216 to defend.

“As a team I have faith in the players… We were in a good position at one stage in the first ODI but unfortunately we collapsed.”

Tharanga acknowledged a direct World Cup spot was in danger. “As a team, we go to each match to win. We are not thinking too far. Thursday’s contest is vital for us because we lost the first. To qualify for the 2019 World Cup, we have to win two matches and all the players are aware of it.”

“There are occasions where the decision we take don’t work out as planned and sometimes we don’t have luck on our side. If you look at the past results, we have been in good positions in the first 20-25 overs and from there onwards only we have lost grip, and batsmen have played irresponsible shots. To get to a big total, we need the top four to fire.”

In 2013, Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) elections, saw only 10 student organisations pitted against each other. This year, the number has risen to 21 student bodies, all of which are in the fray for the elections scheduled for September.

Council president of PU in 2013, Chandan Rana, said, “In the last four years, PU has witnessed a lot of change when it comes to political and non-political organisations. Earlier, parties contested on individual capacity, but when the parties started entering into alliances, smaller groups divided and started forming separate parties.”

“Another reason could be that most parties want to have a political affiliation because they all end up making alliances with bigger parties during elections,” added the senior leader from NSUI.

Besides the main organisations that have inhabited the campus since the 1990s, including National Students Union of India (NSUI), Students Organization of India (SOI), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Panjab University Students Union (PUSU) and Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU), there are 16 others that were launched in later years.

The organisations which have emerged in the last four years include Himachal Pradesh Students Union (HPSU), Himachal Pradesh Students Association (HPSA), All India Students Association (AISA), National Students Organisation of India (NSO), National Youth Association (NYA), Gandhi Group Students Union (GGSU), Pal Pehelwan Students Organisation (PPSO), Panjab University Helping Hands (PUHH) and Panjab Students Union (Lalkar).

Vikas from PUHH, said, “We launched our organisation last year, keeping in mind that we have to work only for students and not necessarily to win elections. It is the only organisation in which all the workers are currently students of PU. This organisation was an initiative of seven PU students.”

Two new student parties were launched this year, including PUSU for Students (PFS) and Independent Students Association (ISA).

Karan Randhawa, president of the newly launched organisation, ISA, echoed his opinion. “I never wanted to be part of the organisations, which acted like seasonal frogs since I worked throughout the year for students. I wanted to continue that, so I decided to form another group. Victory in elections is not the target; our work and dedication matters.”"
"The Big Sick movie review: Kumail Nanjiani, Anupam Kher star in the must-see rom-com of 2017","That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.

It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine, you’re not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer.

At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who audiences might know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.

Kumail is a struggling stand-up comedian who pays the rent for his awful Chicago apartment by driving for Uber. When he’s not on the stage, or in the car, he’s at home with his family in the suburbs. They’re Pakistani and Muslim and have all had arranged marriages and expect Kumail to do the same. He’s managed to live a bit of a double life for a while - dating who he wants while also holding up the pretense of being a good Pakistani son. But everything changes when he meets Emily, the white grad student who he falls for and then loses when she realizes that he’s been hiding her from his family.

To be fair, they would literally disown him if he chose Emily over the scores of Pakistani ladies that “just drop by” their family dinners like clockwork, headshot and bio in hand. So Emily and Kumail break up. They have to. It’s a standard rom-com beat and obstacle. But then something happens: Kumail gets the call that Emily has been hospitalized, and the movie pivots into something entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre.

Suddenly he’s the one making the call to put her in a medically induced coma while also informing her parents, Terry and Beth (Ray Romano and Holly Hunter) of their daughter’s health turn. Beth is none too happy to have her daughter’s ex-boyfriend lurking around during their family crisis, either. Hunter plays Beth, at first, with that scary and all too recognizable indifference of a mother who doesn’t care to humour the man who hurt her daughter. But, like everything, that evolves.

One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.

If there is anything to pick on, it’s that we never get to know Emily as well as Kumail. It’s not her fault, she’s in a coma for most of the film, and we get a fair amount of colour at the beginning, but her arc leaves a bit to be desired.

Michael Showalter’s direction isn’t flashy or stylish, either. His camera is there in service of the story and the characters and it doesn’t get in the way.

Some stories are too good to be true, and some true stories are too good for the movies. Luckily for us, The Big Sick is neither.
