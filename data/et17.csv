Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
"GST: IGST collection from imports rises about 60% in just one month of GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The collection of Integrated Goods and Services Tax from imports crossed Rs 20,000 crore in July — the first month of the roll out of the new indirect tax regime, pointing towards a major jump in revenues. Total customs revenues in July 2017 stood at Rs 26,500 crore as against Rs 16,625 crore collected in July 2016.Collections have been quite robust,” a government official said. However, the official said IGST collections have also received a boost from the fact that there is a component of state GST as well in the tax.Besides, the government has done away with a number of countervailing duty (CVD) exemptions and not extended them under the GST regime that were available in the previous tax regime, such as that on some electronic products.The rise in customs revenues on imports should take care of any decline in GST collections because of any production-related disruption after the rollout of the new regime.Overall GST trends would be available only in August when the final tax collection numbers for July are collated.There is apprehensions that revenues may take a hit because of sluggish sales across the country in the first month of GST. Central Board of Excise and Customs would carry out a detailed analysis of the initial trends when the final numbers become available.India rolled out GST, which replaces 17 central and state taxes such as central excise duty, service tax , value added tax and 23 cesses, from July 1.IGST collections are first revenue trends on the new tax as also indication of the largely smooth rollout. IGST become payable from June 30 midnight on all goods entering the country, barring the exempted ones.IGST on imports replaces countervailing duty and is levied in lieu of state GST and Central GST, but over and above basic customs duty . IGST is equal to the sum of Central GST and State GST levied on any product in the country. GST has subsumed countervailing duty, which was levied in lieu of central excise duty, and special additional duty on imports."
"States take over Rs 2 lakh crore debt of power discoms under UDAY scheme, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: States participating in the government’s Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) scheme have taken over the targeted debt of Rs. 2.09 lakh crore of their distribution firms, the power ministry said in a statement.The states have taken over the debt under the borrowing exemption from the Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management (FRBM) Act given in UDAY for the previous two financial years.“The process of states taking over the targeted debts and issuing them as state development loans ( SDL ) bonds has now been completed. As of now, the participating DISCOMs have to issue bonds worth approximately Rs 37,000 crore,” the statement said. It added since the rest of the debt with discoms is mostly in the nature of capital expenditure debt it is not required to be taken over by the states.Participating DISCOMs have achieved net savings of approximately Rs. 15,000 crore till March, 2017 under the scheme. ”In the participating states, the Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realized (ARR) gaps has come down by almost 14 paise per unit and the AT&C losses have reduced by almost 1 percent in financial years 2016-17,”the statement said.As per the provisions of the UDAY Scheme, which has completed one year, the states would start taking over losses of DISCOMs in a graded manner from now on, starting with taking over 5 percent of the losses of 2016-17 from the current financial year."
"EESL to procure 10,000 electric vehicles to replace government’s fleet, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Energy Efficiency Services Limited ( EESL ), a joint venture company of the ministry of power , has floated a tender to procure 10,000 electric sedan cars along with 4,000 electric vehicle chargers for replacing government vehicles.The ministry of new and renewable energy will be the nodal agency for the procurement of electric vehicles under the government’s faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles in India (FAME) scheme.“At the moment, the plan is for replacing government vehicles with e-vehicles and it will be open to any government agency. We could begin the process by November. Each car is estimated to cost around Rs 12 lakh while a charger would cost around Rs 2 lakh each,” Saurabh Kumar , Managing Director, EESL told ETEnergyworld.The government has estimated an expenditure of around Rs. 1,200 crore for the vehicles and Rs. 80 crore for the chargers.The tender, issued on Tuesday, seeks procurement of 3,000 AC (alternate current) or slow charger's and 1,000 DC (Direct Current) fast charger's compatible with Bharat AC-001 and DC-001 charger specifications.The tender is part of the government's plan to promote electric vehicles. The move is also set to give a boost to the government’s ambitious plans of moving to electric vehicles for all by 2030."
"Slash IUC, licence and spectrum fees","The telecom regulator’s proposal to bring down the Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) promises to both increase bad blood in the telecom sector and worsen its finances. The government must intervene to protect the consumer and the sector’s viability. IUC is the charge that an operator, in whose network a call originates, pays the operator in whose network the call terminates, for the service of receiving the call from the originating network and carrying it on to the called party. As compared to the old 2G days, the network usage per call is lower now when calls are converted into discrete packets that are sent over the network interspersed with packets of other calls and assorted data. This is the rationale for trimming IUC.

However, the cost of the network has gone up because of higher spectrum costs. A lower IUC would lower the cost of a call for the consumer, who, ultimately, bears the cost of the call. However, it would lower revenue for telcos. Now, for large networks such as Bharti and Vodafone, what one pays the other as IUC gets more or less offset by what it receives from it as IUC, since they have roughly the same number of subscribers.

Smaller networks pay out more as IUC to larger networks than what they receive as IUC. Apart from the decline in network usage due to packetisation of calls, two factors favour lower IUC. One, voice accounts for an ever-declining share of telecom revenue globally and net IUC receipts form a tiny fraction of this dwindling part of the business. Two, high IUC is anti-competitive, favouring incumbents against new entrants.

Telecom finances in the country have turned parlous with the aggressive entry of Reliance Jio and the government’s insistence on high spectrum fees, extracted by auctioning tiny chunks of spectrum. To prevent telco loans from adding to the banks’ growing mountain of bad debt, the government must intervene. It can lower the steep revenue shares it collects as licence and spectrum usage fees, still pegged at the high rates set when spectrum was allotted along with the licence without separate upfront payment."
"solar products: GST implementation may hit solar capacity addition in 2018: Report, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India has already installed more solar capacity in the first six months of 2017 than in the entire 2016, according to a report by Mercom Capital Group , which tracks the Indian solar sector.Around 4,800 MW has already been commissioned in calendar year 2017, against 4,038 MW in 2016. The report expected an addition of 10,500 MW through the year, which will be another record, almost twice the 5,525 MW added in financial year 2016-17. But 2018 is likely to be a different story because of confusion over applicability of the goods and services tax ( GST ) on solar products , the report warned.“We have reduced the 2018 forecast by approximately 15% due to uncertainty surrounding GST rates, which has resulted in a slowdown in tenders and auctions.”Initially, the government had maintained that all solar components would invite 5% GST, as reported by ET in its July 4 edition. Later, however, it clarified that only solar modules would be taxed at 5%; the other components would face 18% or 28%.“Government agencies have created an environment of chaos and uncertainty surrounding these rates. It has brought auction and PPA signing activities to a standstill as nobody wants to move forward without knowing what the GST rates are going to be,” Mercom added.The ministry of new and renewable energy is urging the finance ministry to stick to the earlier 5% for all solar equipment, but a decision has yet to be announced.The sharp fall in solar tariffs at the last auctions held in May this year has also become a dampener, according to the report. “States are postponing tenders and auctions as they angle for the lowest possible tariff, especially after the recent winning bid of Rs 2.44 per kwH in the Bhadla Solar Park auction.States are renegotiating power purchase agreements and want to re-tender to get closer to the lowest possible tariff.” Mercom said around 1,000 MW of tenders were cancelled in April-June. The report said the sharp fall in prices of Chinese solar cells and modules has brought down the cost of solar installation to Rs 4 crore per MW. It used to be over Rs 6 crore per MW even a year ago."
Here’s Why That Friendly Smiley You Use In Your Email Maybe Doing You More Harm Than Good,"Think you’re being nice or friendly by adding a smiley to the end or between your emails? Software developers may agree with you and give the full go ahead by equipping you with a barrage of conversational tools, but a recent study claims you may want to consider stopping using smileys or similar emoticons in formal emails.

wokv.com

A recent study, however, called “The Dark Side of a Smiley” claims that smiley face may come across as rather benign and might be causing more harm than a good.

Using a smiley face emoji or similar emoticons in work-related emails may not create a positive impression and could actually portray low competence, reveals the study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.

thebalance.com

""Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence. In formal business emails, a smiley is not a smile,"" said Ella Glikson, a post doctorate fellow at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Israel.

Researchers conducted a series of experiments with a total of 549 participants from 29 different countries.

In one experiment, participants were asked to read a work-related e-mail from an unknown person and then evaluate both the competence and warmth of that person.

All the participants received similar messages. Some included smileys while others did not.

Researchers found that in contrast to face-to-face smiles, which increase both competence and warmth, the smileys in an email had no effect on the perception of warmth, and in fact had a negative effect on the perception of competence.

""The study also found that when the participants were asked to respond to emails on formal matters, their answers were more detailed and they included more content-related information when the e-mail did not include a smiley,"" Glikson said.

""We found that the perceptions of low competence if a smiley is included in turn undermined information sharing,"" she said.

In another experiment, the use of a smiley was compared to a smiling or neutral photograph. The findings show that in the case of a photograph, a smiling sender was perceived as more competent and friendly than a neutral one.

However, when an e-mail on formal work-related matters included a smiley, the sender was perceived as less competent. The smiley did not influence the evaluation of the sender's friendliness, researchers said.

The team also found that when the gender of the e-mail writer was unknown, recipients were more likely to assume that a woman sent the email if it included a smiley.

However, this attribution did not influence the evaluation of competence or friendliness.

""People tend to assume that a smiley is a virtual smile, but the findings show that in the case of the workplace, at least as far as initial 'encounters' are concerned, this is incorrect,"" Glikson said.

""For now, at least, a smiley can only replace a smile when you already know the other person. In initial interactions, it is better to avoid using smileys, regardless of age or gender,"" she added.

Zubair Ahmed, the Quetta Bears batsman, succumbed to the nasty blow he sustained after being hit on the head by a bouncer. The incident occurred during a club match at Mardan District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, on Monday (August 14). Ahmed, who has played four games for Quetta, reportedly didn't have his helmet on when he was struck on the head.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took to Twitter to convey their condolence and also urged every cricketer to wear the protective gear at all times while at the crease.

Tragic death of Zubair Ahmed is another reminder that safety gear i.e. helmet must be worn at all times. Our sympathies with Zubair's family pic.twitter.com/ZNmWDYaT5w — PCB Official (@TheRealPCB) August 16, 2017

Earlier in the week, Australia opener, David Warner, was struck on the neck during a three-day intra-squad game against a Steve Smith-led unit. The southpaw Warner was reportedly jolted by the hit to his neck, but was quickly back on his feet. Smith checked on his national-side deputy before the latter walked off the field. Warner had been dismissed for four in the first innings and had batted 14 balls in the second, before missing his attempted hook shot off Josh Hazlewood and getting hit - cutting short his bid to get some game time before he gets on the flight to Bangladesh. Later, the Australian think-tank decided to rest him on the final day of the practice game as a precautionary measure.

The world of cricket came to a standstill following the untimely demise of Australia cricketer Phil Hughes, who failed to recover from the head injury copped in a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales in November, 2014. Ever since, calls for enhanced protective gear, and safety at all times, have increased.

"Rajasthan govt signs JV agreement with HPCL for Barmer refinery, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Jaipur: The Rajasthan government today signed a joint venture agreement with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) for the upcoming mega petroleum refinery in Barmer at a cost of Rs 43,129 crore.

Under the agreement, HPCL will hold 74 per cent stake in the joint venture, HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd, while the state government will hold the rest 26 per cent.

The agreement was signed in presence of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje by the Secretary, Mines and Petroleum, Aparna Arora and HPCL's Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy.

Raje expressed satisfaction at the progress of the establishment of the refinery and said that all necessary approvals for Rajasthan refinery will be acquired in the prescribed timeframe.

She further said it is the state government's endeavour to get the work started immediately after ground breaking ceremony.

The CM said that as a result of the re-negotiation with HPCL, a significant savings of Rs 40,000 crore have been ensured in the project cost.

She said that under the new conditions, the state will now get 12 per cent return on investment (investment income) than the 2 per cent fixed in the previous agreement.

Raje said that Barmer refinery will be the country's first refinery project to manufacture petro-products of BS-6 standard and will be an environmental friendly project.

She instructed the officials to make local youths job ready for the refinery and related industries through ITI and skill development centres.

She asked officials to explore the possibilities of establishing a petroleum institute in West Rajasthan.

Raje said the project, being set up to prepare petroleum and various types of petro-chemical products from Rajasthan crude oil, will not only strengthen the economy of Barmer but the entire Western Rajasthan.

She said that Western Rajasthan would emerge as the hub of petroleum subsidiaries, which would generate direct and indirect employment opportunities.

During the signing ceremony, Water Resources Minister Ram Pratap and Minister of State for Minerals and Petroleum Surendra Pal Singh, Chief Secretary Ashok Jain, HPCL CMD MK Surana and Additional Chief Secretary of the State Mines and Petroleum NC Goyal and other senior officials were present."

Teenagers in danger: Blue Whale challenge exposes many socio-psychological vulnerabilities,"Technology is a mixed blessing. For children it can mean enriching new avenues of education as well as better entertainment. But the gadgetry that’s such a defining part of their life today also brings with it constantly morphing dangers, which are very difficult for parents to track 24×7. The Blue Whale Challenge, which has been linked to teenage deaths from Russia to America, is a peril that’s come to attention in India over the last month. The structure of this ‘game’ is that over 50 days the victim is given around 50 self-harm tasks, designed to culminate in suicide.

India’s IT ministry has now directed top internet platforms like Google and Facebook to remove all links to the online game. This is necessary, but will not go far enough to correct the social predicament that underlies why some children may participate in such deadly online games. For one, there will remain corners of the internet where such dangers will still lurk. Two, many young people were being pushed to suicide even before the existence of such games, for reasons society does not really understand, and it is easy to blame such games as the proximate cause when actual causation is much more nebulous. In that sense the urban legends circulating in Delhi and environs about someone chopping off women’s hair are a close analogy. They become ways of naming the state of collective insecurity and free-floating anxiety that we inhabit.

Pressure on young people today is enormous: they are confronted by a dysfunctional education system, support of joint families is gone, parents are overstretched by stresses of modern life. Among the solutions have to be better education as well as better parenting: Talk to the children, have a meaningful engagement with their life and, yes, pay attention to what they are up to online."
"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."

"Govt capex to rise 25 per cent to Rs 3.9 lakh crore by 2019-20, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government's capital expenditure will rise by 25 per cent to Rs 3.9 lakh crore by 2019-20, with defence outlay alone jumping 22 per cent, according to the Mid-Year Review tabled in Parliament today.

It has budgeted for Rs 3,09,801 crore as capital expenditure during the current fiscal which will rise to Rs 3,41,000 crore in the next one, and to Rs 3,90,000 crore in 2019-20, it said.

Defence, which accounts for about 30 per cent of the government's capital outlay, will see the spending rise from Rs 91,580 crore in the current fiscal to Rs 1,01,137 crore in the next one and Rs 1,11,706 crore in 2019-20.

Together with revenue expenditure, government's total spending is projected to rise from Rs 21.46 lakh crore in 2017-18 to Rs 23.4 lakh crore in the next financial year and Rs 25.95 lakh crore in 2019-20.

While outgo on fertiliser subsidy is projected to be flat at Rs 70,000 crore between the current fiscal and 2019-20, the food subsidy bill will rise to Rs 1.75 lakh crore in 2018-19 and Rs 2 lakh crore in the following fiscal. Food subsidy bill in current fiscal is pegged at Rs 1.45 lakh crore.

Petroleum subsidy would drop to Rs 18,000 crore in 2018- 19 from Rs 25,000 crore in current fiscal and to Rs 10,000 crore in 2019-20.

Petrol and diesel prices have been decontrolled and subsidy outgo on petrol is restricted to LPG and kerosene.

""In continuation of the efforts of the government to rationalise subsidises, the Government has decided to increase the cost of LPG cylinders by Rs 4 per month. The ultimate aim of the Government is to eliminate the subsidy on LPG cylinders by end March 2018,"" the review said.

After successful implementation of paying subsidies directly into bank accounts of LPG users, the government is now focused on reducing kerosene subsidies.

Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 this year as also the increased surveillance post demonetisation would expand the tax base from in next two fiscal years, the review said.

The tax-GDP ratio will increase by 30 basis points in 2018-19 and 2019-20. ""The tax-GDP ratios are projected to be 11.6 per cent in 2018-19 and 11.9 per cent in 2019-20,"" it said.

While the revenue deficit target of 2 per cent of GDP will be met in current fiscal, the deficit would be 1.9 per cent in the next. ""However the elimination of effective revenue deficit will have to be re-calibrated,"" it said.

The review projected aggregate revenue expenditure in Defence, excluding pensions, to grow by about 10.4 per cent in 2018-19 and 8.5 per cent in 2019-20. ""This pushes the defence revenue expenditure to Rs 201,511 crore and Rs 218,629 crore in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively,"" it said."

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release — to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour’s standards. Somehow ‘comfort zone’ has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life’s journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‘until a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.’ Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‘I’,the soil into which it is buried is God — the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected — into us.■

Blue Whale Strikes Again! Two Kerala Families Say Their Sons Committed Suicide After Playing The Game,"The deadly online challenge game, which is spreading like wildfire appears to have claimed more victim in India than what is already been reported. With the news about the deadly game making headlines now more and more people have come forward expressing doubts about the deaths of their family members.

Two new suspected cases of Blue Whale deaths have now surfaced from Kerala.

In the first case, the family of Manoj C Manu, a teenager from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram who committed suicide last month has now approached police claiming that they doubt the role of the game in his death.

In their complaint, the family said Manoj who was a class XI student had downloaded the game nine months ago and had been addicted to it since.

His mother Anu told a Malayalam news channel that she had talked him out of it. But with the recent reports of the Blue Whale challenge, she said Manoj's behaviour was similar to those killed themselves playing the dare game.

She claimed that Manoj, who never used to go out alone had visited a beach by himself, jumped into a river despite not knowing how to swim and even used to visit a cemetery.

Manoj was found hanging at his home on July 26.

Police who had earlier registered a case of unnatural death said they will look into the possibility, but expressed doubts as Manoj had hung himself, whereas, in all the other reported cases of deaths or attempts to kill themselves, the gamers had jumped off buildings.

Another similar case has surfaced from Kannur, where an IIT student named Sawant killed himself last month.

According to Swanta's mother her son used to spent the whole night playing the game on his phone and frequently used to venture out from home at night only to return in the morning.

After he began hurting himself and inscribing letters on his body using a compass, Swant's family who thought he had mental issues had taken him for counselling.

He committed suicide last month by hanging himself.

While the links to the two deaths and the challenge game is yet to be established, this is not the first such report from Kerala. After it was reported that two teenagers ventured into a beach in Alappuzha under suspicious circumstances, the Kerala government had urged the central government to ban the game.

The Central government has already directed internet companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to remove links to the game from their services.

So far, there is one confirmed case of Blue Whale death in India, a 14-year-old Mumbai boy who killed himself playing the game.

There have been a number of reports attempted suicides from many parts of the country since.

The Blue Whale is a challenge based game developed by some Russian programmers. It is said to be involving daily challenges for the gamers from daring to risky. Some of them include watching horror movies alone to hurting themselves.

In the 50th level, it is said that the participants are challenged to attempt suicide. In all the stages, the participant is asked to make a video of the challenge.

The administrator whom the player is in contact is said to emotionally blackmail the player to complete the challenge."

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now © Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."

The Economic Times,"Why bitcoins are headed for a rough ride The notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, whose 160 percent surge this year has captivated everyone from Wall Street bankers to Chinese grandmothers, could be headed for one of its most turbulent stretches yet. Blame the bitcoin civil war. After two years of largely behind-the-scenes bickering, rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 billion market.

"3D printing: Researchers develop new method to 3D print living tissues, Health News, ET HealthWorld","London: In a step towards helping repair damaged body parts, scientists in Britain have developed a new method to 3D-print laboratory-grown cells to form living structures.In the study published in the journal Scientific Reports , the researchers demonstrated how a range of human and animal cells can be printed into high-resolution tissue constructs.The approach could revolutionise regenerative medicine, enabling the production of complex tissues and cartilage that would potentially support, repair or augment diseased and damaged areas of the body.""The ability to 3D print with adult stem cells and still have them differentiate was remarkable, and really shows the potential of this new methodology to impact regenerative medicine globally,"" said Adam Perriman from the University of Bristol Interest in 3D printing living tissues has grown in recent years, but, developing an effective way to use the technology has been difficult, particularly since accurately controlling the position of cells in 3D is hard to do.They often move within printed structures and the soft scaffolding printed to support the cells can collapse on itself. As a result, it remains a challenge to print high-resolution living tissues.But, led by Professor Hagan Bayley of the University of Oxford , the team devised a way to produce tissues in self-contained cells that support the structures to keep their shape.The cells were contained within protective nanolitre droplets wrapped in a lipid coating that could be assembled, layer-by-layer, into living structures.Producing printed tissues in this way improves the survival rate of the individual cells, and allowed the team to improve on current techniques by building each tissue one drop at a time to a more favourable resolution.To be useful, artificial tissues need to be able to mimic the behaviours and functions of the human body.The method enables the fabrication of patterned cellular constructs, which, once fully grown, mimic or potentially enhance natural tissues, the researchers said.""We were aiming to fabricate three-dimensional living tissues that could display the basic behaviours and physiology found in natural organisms,"" lead author Alexander Graham from Oxford Synthetic Biology said.""To date, there are limited examples of printed tissues, which have the complex cellular architecture of native tissues. Hence, we focused on designing a high-resolution cell printing platform, from relatively inexpensive components, that could be used to reproducibly produce artificial tissues with appropriate complexity from a range of cells including stem cells,"" Graham added."
"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‘ International Diabetes Update ’ 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."
Internet Turns A Popular Scene From ‘Main Hoon Na’ Into Hilarious Memes & Everyone’s Going Nuts,"Social media is a funny place and we all have to admit that whenever we feel low or bored, we just scroll through our social media profiles, and laugh at the innumerable memes that keep doing the rounds.

Rohit intends a ""behind the scene"" role as India's new ODI deputy

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:28 PM

Rohit Sharma, the India ODI team's newly-appointed vice-captain, said he was honoured to be named the deputy to Virat Kohli for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. He also added that the role will be a little bit more backstage compared to what he does with the Mumbai Indians, where he is the captain.

""It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain,"" Rohit said after the team's optional practice session in Pallekele on Wednesday (August 16). ""Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. Being the vice-captain now feels really, really good. It's a kind of honour that whenever the opportunity comes - the first One-Dayer, when we come [play] on August 20 - there will be some sort of role that I will need to play, and I am looking forward to it. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. Yes, it will be a good opportunity for me to get on to the field.

""It's a different ball game completely. IPL and when you come and play international cricket, it is completely different. But again, the excitement and the energy level is the same. So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role. But yes, I will be very excited to step on to the field as the vice-captain of the Indian team.""

Rohit was one of the three players who turned up for the optional practice session, alongside KL Rahul and Axar Patel. The opener was seen playing a number of sweeps and reverse-sweeps against the net bowlers. Rohit hinted that the shots were part of a plan to counter Lasith Malinga.

""Everyday is a learning day, today I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse-sweeps when someone like Malinga comes and bowls to you. It is something that the game demands these days. You got to be innovative and you got to play different kind of shots to get maximum results. You keep learning every day and I keep trying these things and learn about things I can do and things I cannot do. Every addition to your armoury is good and I am trying to see what I can add to my armoury. What better place than coming here and doing it; that's what training sessions are all about. Come here, improve your skills, and try and get better as a player,"" he added.

Speaking about India's opponents, Sri Lanka, Rohit said they were a dangerous side, as evidenced by their victory over India in the Champions Trophy, but added that India would look to stick to their strengths.

""I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series, but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in One-Day cricket, they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years. We got to stick to our strength.

""We have been playing good cricket. West Indies was good, Champions Trophy was good except for one day - but that can happen - but in the past two years, we have played some consistent cricket in the ODI format. As far as I am concerned, we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That's what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths,"" he said.

Housing for all by 2022 faces 'slum challenge',"Delhi/NCR

With the government sanctioning only 52,666 houses for the slum dwellers against the requirement of at least one crore houses under the in-situ scheme, the Centre's ambitious target to ensure ""decent"" dwelling units to all by 2022 seems to be on a slippery wicket.

Under the in-situ development sub-scheme of PM Awas Yojna (PMAY-Urban), slum dwellers will get houses at the same location to ensure their livelihood is not disturbed. Though private investment is the key to such projects, the private sector has not come forward till now.

The number of houses sanctioned for slum dwellers is just 2.2% of the total houses approved under PMAY, which includes interest subsidy initiative. The housing and urban affairs ministry recently submitted the details in Parliament.

The Centre has set the target of two crore houses for the houseless in the next five years. According to official estimate, urban areas faced nearly 1.9 crore housing shortage in 2012. Reports also suggest there were little over one crore slum households across the country. Without ensuring slum dwellers are shifted to pucca houses, housing for all won't be a reality.

The ministry said it has been urging states to do the needful and a meeting for a discussion will soon be convened.

""Of the total number of affordable houses approved for construction in urban areas of about 24 lakhs so far, over 20% were for the benefit of slum dwellers. These include in-situ slum redevelopment for the benefit of about 53,000 slum dwellers and another four lakh slum dwellers having been sanctioned houses under other components of PMAY (Urban) like beneficiary led construction and affordable housing in partnership,"" a ministry spokesperson said.

He added the issues concerning in-situ development are the attitude of slum dwellers themselves.

"There are many projects in India to sequence human genomes: Brenda J Andrews, Health News, ET HealthWorld",", Professor and Director,, Canada, talks to ETHealthworld about the growth of functional genomics and their collaboration with India. Edited excerpts:The difference between genomics and functional genomics is that “genomics” is the science of determining a genome sequence. We can determine genome sequences now in any organism in a very short period of time for little money. Functional genomics is the science of trying to understand the information and that requires us to manipulate it in some way to see what the consequences are of perturbing certain genes and certain sequences in the genome. There is no technology of doing that in all systems. Doing a focussed experiment is a major challenge which will require huge investments by labs around the world, to try to really understand what each gene in the human genome is doing and how the genomes work together to make the cells function the way they do. We need to understand how these genes basically are wired together in order to make a certain outcome. We are getting there in some of the projects that are ongoing in our centre which involve trying to perturb genes by themselves or in combination of trying to figure out what happens to the cells. I hope over the next few years a lot of current methods will be developed such as genome engineering methods that have come out in the last few years. Those can be further developed so that we can do functional genomics experiment much faster and interpret them better.The Donnelly Centre was established about 10 years ago with the idea of setting up centre for biology and the idea was to make rapid progress in functional genomics. Mainly we need to put scientists with different expertise together in the same place. We are at the University of Toronto, it has a great computer science department, a great chemistry department, big faculty of medicine but those people never use to talk to each other. So we thought to put them together in the same space and then new science will emerge. The building opened in 2006, our scientists in the building were from applied sciences in engineering, people that were experts in stem cell engineering, other people from the chemistry department and a lot of computer scientists cause you need a lot of computer scientists to interpret genome information. In the last 10 years we also requited new people into the building which filled the gaps in our expertise and now we have many ongoing projects that involve collaborations between at least 5-6 different scientists in the centre and their trainees. So we consider that our bigger success that is our project has started because of who we are and where we are together, in the same building and that probably wouldn’t have happened if we were scattered across other buildings.The partnering with India that is ongoing at the moment was set up largely by Sachdev Sidhu who is a professor in the Donnelly Centre. He was recruited to the centre from genetics in the United States where he developed platforms for doing a technical platform called Phage Display and this allowed him to engineer proteins. So these are the building blocks or protein that were encoded by the DNA to engineer proteins to do basically what he wanted them to do and the specialty is antibodies which are one of the largest growing drug sectors in the world. So they have setup this platform at the Donnelly centre and has been collaborating to try to think about how we might together make new antibodies that are largely oncology targets together.It is hard to predict because five years ago if you asked me how I see the future I would have been completely wrong. The reasons are two: DNA sequencing got a lot cheaper and we have got better methods for genome engineering. So the CRISPR Cas9 system can now be used to precisely engineer the human genome and that wasn’t available 5 years ago. It is hard to predict if you can’t even imagine what techniques might come so that makes it a challenging but also a very exciting time in biomedicine. I certainly think that we might have huge amounts of genome sequencing information. I know that there are many projects here in India to sequence human genomes. There are projects like that around the world and I think we will get way better in understanding it; our computational methods will get better so I think the flow of information 5 years from now will be much smoother and much valuable."
"petrol pumps: Petrol pump racket: Accused visited 25 nations to study tricks to rig machines, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: The man at the centre of the investigations into tampering of fuel dispensers made several trips aboard to study technology and methods for rigging machines at petrol pumps , cops have learned.Prakash Nulkar, 56, who previously worked at a manufacturer of fuel dispensers, visited 25 countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa between 1998 and 2017. He finally decided to import components such as microchips from China and altered them to suit local specifications, said an officer with the Thane Crime Branch The chips were inserted into fuel dispensing units, which then pumped less fuel than what customers paid for. The method helped dishonest petrol station owners skim hundreds of litres of fuel every day.“Nulkar was the biggest supplier of tampered machines and parts to petrol stations across the country. He revealed many details during interrogation,” said the officer, who has been part of the probe from the start.On June 16, the Thane Crime Branch inspected a petrol station in Manpada and found that its dispensing units had been altered to secretly pump less fuel. Several petrol stations were subsequently raided in Mumbai, Thane district and other parts of the state and more instances of cheating came to light.Nulkar was arrested from Hubli Karnataka , on July 11. He apparently wanted to set up an operations control centre in China. Investigators are reviewing his international transactions and trying to identify suspects located outside India.One of his main associates in the country was Vivek Shetye, a 47-yearold software engineer from Dombivali. He was arrested earlier. The Crime Branch officer said multiple teams tracked Nulkar’s movements for close to a month before finally nabbing him.In all, he made 40 trips abroad. Singapore, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Madagascar, Bahrain, Myanmar, Malaysia are among the countries he visited. “Nulkar conducted a detailed study before starting the racket. All his foreign trips and the people he met there are under scrutiny. This could be just the tip of the iceberg,” said deputy police commissioner (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe.So far, evidence of tampering has been found at 125 petrol pumps across the state."

Bonds Of Friendship: Taipei Universiade is Taiwan’s red carpet for the world,"From August 19 to 30, Taiwan’s capital Taipei will host more than 7,700 student athletes from 153 countries for the 2017 Summer Universiade. The latter is the premier international multi-sport event for University athletes who consider it to be a stepping stone to participation in the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Olympics. The Taipei Universiade will see the young athletes vie for laurels in 21 sports at 38 different venues. In fact, this Universiade will be the largest international sporting event in Taiwan – a big feat for this island nation of 23 million people.

But what’s even more important for Taiwan is that the Universiade is an opportunity for it to broaden its international engagements and build ties of friendship. As is well known, Taiwan has official diplomatic ties with a handful of small countries. Saddled by the historical baggage of the Chinese civil war that forced the Kuomintang to flee to Taiwan and transplant the Republic of China there, the Taiwanese today continue to navigate complicated narratives of identity and state. Add to this the fact that an overwhelming majority of countries in the world recognise only one China, which being the People’s Republic of China, and it’s easy to see why Taiwan has had to find creative ways to keep its diplomatic and strategic depth intact.

And one of the ways in which Taiwan has done that – and continues to do so – is to become a giver. It has tried its best to share its successes with the rest of the world, be it through outbound investments, manufacturing and research collaboration, or medical aid and technical assistance. Of course, all of this hasn’t been easy with China constantly pressuring Taiwan to toe its line of eventual re-unification. However, the reality is that Taiwan today is very different from China. The former has evolved into a robust multi-party democracy, while the latter has become a Communist powerhouse. Plus, the new generation in Taiwan has no real attachment with China. And having grown up in a free-thinking, democratic atmosphere, it is hard to see Taiwanese youth even consider re-unification with the mainland.

Nonetheless, Taiwan’s challenges remain as it continues to be constrained from taking part in the comity of nations as a normal country. And it’s here that Taiwan’s well-wishers need to help it. After all, Taiwan is a unique success story – a manufacturing dynamo, a beacon of democracy and a leader in cutting-edge innovation and research – that needs to be nurtured further. All Taiwan asks for is friendship and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is focussed on building long-lasting relationships rather than cost-benefit economic activities that usually determine foreign policy. Taiwan is thinking about everyone’s future and solutions to global challenges – it simply can’t afford to be selfish.

This is precisely why the Taipei Universiade is so important for Taiwan. By welcoming young people from across the world to Taiwanese shores, Taiwan wants to build ever-lasting friendships. Indian athletes too will be participating at this Universiade. It is hoped that they, along with athletes from other nations, will become bridges for their respective countries to Taiwan – the heart of Asia."

James Alex Fields Jr, the driver, was denied bond on Monday .Trump met top law enforcement officials at the White House to discuss the issue.Critics said Trump waited too long to address the violence, and slammed him for stating when he did that “many sides“ were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white-supremacist marchers.Merck's Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump or criticise him directly in a statement posted on the drug company's Twitter account, but the rebuke was implicit. “America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy , which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,“ he said.Trump immediately hit back, but made no reference to Frazier's comments on values, instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!“ Trump said in a Twitter post.In his comments on Saturday, Trump denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.“Authorities said Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of antiracism activists confronting neo-Nazis and KKK sympathisers, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides in the Virginia town.Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to defend the president in TV interviews on Monday in which he stressed the administration was taking a robust approach to investigations.The attack on counterprotesters “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism,“ Sessions said."

"Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals & Gautam Gambhir pledge to spread awareness for organ donation, Health News, ET HealthWorld","12th August 2017, New Delhi: Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals and Ace Cricketer Gautam Gambhir came together on the occasion of World Organ Donation Day to encourage people to take a pledge for donating organs to save countless lives. This public awareness initiative aims to bring together information and awareness on the issue of organ donation. Gift A Life ” is a unique initiative of the Apollo Institute of Transplants to encourage people to pledge their organs and save countless lives in the process. This can be done by simply signing up on the web site – www.giftalife.org.Gautam Gambhir also encouraged people to pledge for their organ donation, as the same can save many lives. The gathering also witnessed presence of organ recipients who were given a new lease of life through cadaver organ donations. Dr Anupam Sibal , Group Medical Director and Senior Paediatric Gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospitals Group said “We are thankful to Gautam Gambhir for supporting us in this Noble cause. Each year, thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant. There is a shortage of organs, and the gap between the number of organs donated and the number of people waiting for a transplant is getting larger. One of the major reasons is lack of awareness about Organ Donation in India at large where majority of population is still shackled with myths and religious beliefs regarding Organ Donation in India, hence there is an urgent need of address this issue and create sound awareness on organ donation in India.All the staff of Indraprastha Apollo Hospital also took pledge to donate organs along with Gautam Gambhir. They also urged everyone to make the decision to donate their organ. Gautam Gambhir also appealed to the media to create awareness about organ donation and saving precious lives.Every year almost 5 lakh people die in India due to non-availability of organs. Nearly 1.5 lakh people are in dire need of kidney but only 3 thousand of them receive one. Vital organs such as the heart, pancreas, liver, kidneys and lungs can be transplanted to those whose organs are failing. A single donor can save eight lives by donating the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas and small bowel."
"Over threefold jump in India’s solar capacity in past two years: Piyush Goyal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: India’s total installed solar power generation capacity grew over threefold to 13,652 Megawatt (MW) over the past two fiscal years, power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal said today.“The cumulative solar energy capacity installed as on 31 July 2017 is 13,652 MW while the same at the end of 2014-15 was 3,743.97 MW,” Goyal said in a written reply in Lok Sabha. “The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have crossed the solar installed capacity of 1 GW, as on 31 July, 2017,” Goyal wrote.The Minister also stated the government has revised the National Solar Mission target of Grid Connected Solar Power projects from 20,000 MW by 2022 to 100,000 MW by 2022. This is sought to be achieved through rooftop solar projects (40,000 MW) and ground-mounted solar projects (60,000 MW), he said.The renewable energy ministry has announced various initiatives in a bid to promote solar energy including Solar Park Scheme for setting up over 50 Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects targeting over 40,000 MW projects and scheme for setting up 1,000 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects by Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) with Viability Gap Funding (VGF), among others.Goyal also pointed out that there was no specific ‘Solar Energy Policy’ being formulated in a written reply to another question. The centre has set an ambitious target of setting up 175 GW renewable power installed capacity by the end of 2022. This includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass power and 5 GW from small hydro power."
Increasing gulf in quality defines current health of Asian giants,"Sri Lanka will have to improve massively in order to challenge India later this year. © AFP

Purely as a game, I sometimes try to do the old six word review of things. I attempted it for the series against Sri Lanka and came up with: Sri Lanka abysmal, India intimidating. It told me everything about the series and I had a word left! The home team was that bad.

Admittedly, India began overwhelming favourites but teams have visited the lovely island as favourites before and discovered opposition they sometimes hadn't anticipated. There were always, certainly in the last fifteen years, players who could take the game away from you. There were tough players, others with an air of mystery around them, some who played exotic shots and bowled at unique angles. This time there were none. It is not good for cricket because Sri Lanka has given us some very fine talents who inevitably resided within modest personalities.

It is easy therefore to belittle India's performance but that wouldn't be fair. You play the opposition you are provided and if there is a gulf between the two teams in ability, you make sure that is reflected in the scorecards. And sure it was. Each time, India racked up a lead in excess of 300, the margins of victory were the kind you would expect if a heavyweight boxer entered the ring with a middleweight. To that extent, India did what they could and while playing an opponent who hardly throws a punch back can lead to bad habits, India dominated like the better side is meant to.

Shikhar Dhawan made the most of the opportunity as did Cheteshwar Pujara. One punched with a smile, the other made incisions with narrowed eyes. And all the batsmen partook of the feast on offer. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up 17 wickets and scored runs fluently and until a headmasterly approach to the game took out Ravindra Jadeja, he had fun too. And if Hardik Pandya had been asked to choose a debut series, he couldn't have picked a better one. There is something about him and I hope it stays that way as fame envelops him. If you like fame too much it isn't your best companion as doubtlessly he will be told by wise heads. Kuldeep Yadav impressed too and the fact that batsmen don't seem to pick him means captains will always be tempted to pick him. India will have some tough choices to make in the days ahead.

If you are a cricket lover, it is difficult not to be carried away by the manner in which the ball leaves Mohammed Shami's hands and makes its journey to the batsman. The seam is upright and proud and the ball reaches the bat at a nippy pace. Shami probably bowled too little and admitted in an interview that he was the support bowler in these conditions. That may be understating things but I do hope he thinks he is Ashwin when the side tours more seam-friendly lands.

But for all that, the most dramatic performance for me came from a quiet man whose deeds even modern scoreboards haven't found ways to reflect. Wriddhiman Saha's wicket-keeping in the second Test was the performance of the series for me.

Sri Lanka come to India this winter and I hope they have more to offer. Karunaratne, Mendis, Mathews and Chandimal are far better players than they let themselves be at most times but it is the bowling they need to sort. Sandakan must play everytime but how do they replace Herath? I wish they can cajole a few more months out of fingers that have twirled so long because otherwise their batsmen will always have a mountain of runs in front of them.

The one-dayers will be more competitive but I'm afraid Test cricket needs to come to grips with the crisis that confronts it. Nobody came to watch and when one team looks like a juggernaut and the other a meek figure waiting to be run over, it doesn't bode well.

"Plant-based vaccines could help eradicate polio virus, Health News, ET HealthWorld","A = VLPs in vitreous ice. B = Reconstruction of poliovirus. C = VLP showing empty internal surface. D and E = Resolutions of poliovirus

London: In a breakthrough, scientists have used plants to produce a new vaccine against the polio virus , a finding which can pave the way for global eradication of the disease.The novel vaccine was produced with a method that uses virus-like particles (VLPs) -- non-pathogenic mimics of the polio virus which are grown in plants.Genes that carry information to produce VLPs are infiltrated into the plant tissues. The host plant then reproduces large quantities of them using its own protein expression mechanisms.""This is an incredible collaboration involving plant science, animal virology and structural biology. The question for us now is how to scale it up -- we don't want to stop at a lab technique,"" said George Lomonossoff, Professor from the John Innes Centre -- a UK-based independent research organisation.VLPs look like viruses but are non-infectious. They have been biologically engineered so they do not contain the nucleic acid that allows viruses to replicate.This means that they mimic the behaviour of the virus, stimulating the immune system to respond without causing an infection of poliomyelitis, the researchers said.Laboratory tests demonstrated that the polio virus mimics provided animals with immunity from the disease paving the way for human vaccines to be produced by plants on a major scale with the input of pharmaceutical industry collaborators.Polio virus destroys motor neurons in the central nervous system causing paralysis or even death.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative led by the World Health Organisation has resulted in 99 per cent fewer cases in the past 30 years. However, the current vaccines require the production of huge quantities of live polio virus, which increases the risk of accidental re-introductions.The successful development of VLPs not only holds promise for the production of vaccines for polio but it could also become a frontline diagnostic resource in producing vaccines against other viral outbreaks, the researchers said."

But, prolonged denial to consume edible items with no feel from within is a sign to be getting cautious off. Not even force feeding would help them gain their will from within."
"Unleashing the potential of technology in intelligent vaccine management, Health News, ET HealthWorld","ByCEO, Hilleman Laboratories , MSD Wellcome TrustIndia has come a long way since its ‘Tryst with Destiny’ 70 years ago. This especially holds true if we look at the extraordinary evolution of our healthcare environment. Today, India is known globally as the “Pharmacy of the World”. We not only create medicines for 1.3 billion Indians, we also export them in large quantities to other underdeveloped as well as developed nations of the world. India’s expertise at producing globally acclaimed medicines including vaccines has earned us the pride of being a nation which has the largest capacity for WHO prequalified vaccine manufacturing in the world.For a nation to make such remarkable progress as ours, multiple reasons come into play. One very pertinent reason is the political will of the country, as rightly put by Dr Samlee Plianbangchang Regional Director, WHO , in his advice on strengthening public health for human development. A clear example of this is our commitment to ‘Mission Indradhanush’, which aims to realise 90% basic vaccination coverage in our population by 2018. What’s more, in the BRICS Health Ministers' Meeting of 2017, the Indian Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, ç, reinstated India’s growing commitment towards healthcare. He assured that the country’s National Health Policy is completely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals targets, with major focus on improving the country's vaccine programmes and drug security. This shows India’s absolute resolve in meeting its Millennium Development Goal (MDG).However, as with any success story, there are gaps. For a country that provides 37% (1) of the total WHO pre-qualified vaccines, India is far from achieving complete coverage in immunization within its own population. According to WHO, India has only succeeded in achieving 65% coverage in basic immunization while countries with similar or lower per capita GDP are far ahead. For instance, Brazil stands at 90% and Mexico at 88% . This is quite disappointing given that India accounts for approximately one-fourth of global deaths from vaccine preventable diseases (VPD). Besides, supply of indigenously produced, low-cost vaccines is plentiful. What makes it further distressing is the fact that even countries with low resource settings, for instance Bangladesh, have been able to achieve near full immunization coverage. Thus, it is not good news for India. Today, India has ten million under-immunized children , and a frightening 1 of every 3rd child in the country is not fully immunized under our National Immunization Program. This must change.One of the most formidable challenges that exists in the country’s healthcare system is the inefficiencies in vaccine management, mostly in logistics and temperature monitoring systems (2). Ironically our universal immunization program (UIP), which is among the world’s biggest, is largely facilitated by indigenously developed vaccines, an admirable feat. In addition, almost all the globally recommended policies for vaccine management are adopted in India, including the use of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs), the shake-test, the multi-dose vial policy (MDVP), the use of diluents and the monitoring of vaccine wastage rates. But the country’s vast population, geographical expanse combined with poor living conditions have vastly impeded the vaccine delivery system, leading to huge vaccine wastage and inadequate immunization coverage.It takes meticulous planning, strong logistics and cross-functional innovation to transport a vaccine from its manufacturing site to administration in the field. At the heart of a robust delivery system is cold chain infrastructure . Cold chains help preserve vaccines at prescribed temperatures and maintain product-specific environmental parameters including air quality levels. They are the primary source for transporting and storing vaccines, more so in tropical climate of developing countries like India. A breakdown of the cold chain system results in wastage of vaccines due to exposure to environmental conditions. Administering expired vaccines can do more harm than good and must be avoided at all costs. Thus, lack of sustained cold chain management can prove detrimental towards achieving immunization coverage .A study by the National Cold Chain & Vaccine Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC) shows that in India there is a 25% shortage in overall cold chain capacity (National Cold Chain Assessment, 2014). There exists a glaring 200-300% scarcity in walk-in coolers (WIC) and walk-in freezers (WIF) (1) This is extremely worrying as India aims to introduce more vaccines within its UIP which is likely to further burden our crumbling systems.What the country needs at this hour is an efficient mechanism to optimise vaccine outreach and delivery. First, we need to build on our existing capacity including our technical staff by increasing their ability to handle complex vaccine environment and familiarize them with best practices in supply chain management. Second, vaccines under all conditions, need to be carefully temperature managed so that they don’t lose their potency. Third, we need efficient collection of reliable data for informed decision-making in planning for vaccine distribution, in improving supply chains, and in introducing newer vaccines in the future.Globally, and in India, newer technologies are being explored to minimise vaccine wastage. A case that needs special mention is the development of heat stable vaccines. Once fully developed, these vaccines will greatly relieve the need for cold chain, easing the logistical problems that we face today and bringing down costs (7). This also means it will be much easier to store, transport and administer vaccines across multiple geographies. Consequently, these next-generation heat stable vaccines can be delivered to the most remote corners of India, ensuring wider immunization coverage. Another great example of the use of newer technologies is the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN). In 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare partnered with UNDP to design and implement an Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network which allows healthcare workers to better understand the vaccine preservation machinery. The eVIN innovation is already making an impact in our UIP and early results suggest a promising start.In short, these are exciting times for healthcare in India. The world of vaccines is showing more promise than ever. Technology and Innovation have made healthcare sustainability a real possibility of near future. And with the will to conquer and the technology in our grasp, I am confident that India will continue to surge ahead in bridging the gap of vaccine access and coverage among the most deserving of our people."

Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:44 AM

Irrespective of how much I may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. © AFP

Given all the drama that surrounded the selection of the coach before they left for the tour of Sri Lanka late in July, a 3-0 series sweep like this one, wrapped up in just under eleven days, has once again brought the smiles back in the Indian camp. Ravi Shastri, back in a very familiar setting that he had helped put in place during his previous stint, is understandably elated. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Shastri talks about the road map ahead, his chemistry with the cricketers and his role going forward. Excerpts...

This was a first: A series sweep away from home. It should instil a good deal of aggression and positivity.

When was the last time that Sri Lanka were beaten like this at home? I'd like to wait and see how some other teams will cope against this same Sri Lankan team in the near future. But then, this is not about Sri Lanka, this is about the Indian team and the manner in which they've stamped their authority here. India's lowest score in this series (487) was still a 100-odd runs more than the best that Sri Lanka could manage throughout the three Tests. So, that should sum-up the total dominance, with the bat and ball.

What are the takeaways for the team after a performance like this?

Even if this team ends up losing a game, as long as they can walk out of the field with their heads held high, knowing that they gave their best, there's no problem whatsoever. A disciplined approach is what counts. For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik [Pandya] and one in the third game from [Mohammad] Shami, we've not faltered. How many catches did we drop throughout this series? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid. It's the effort that counts and in that, if we have to look at the bigger picture, we're taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.

The bowling unit has been coming together splendidly...

Bharath Arun has known these youngsters for such a long time now. Look at Kuldeep [Yadav], for instance. He's been tracking Kuldeep's growth from the Under-16 days. It's the same with some of the others he's worked with for a while now. So, in that sense, there's a sense of familiarity that's also helping. We've always seen Kuldeep as a guy with great potential but let's not go on harping about it. One step at a time. Not just the Test team, even [in] the ODIs, now that we have the likes of Jasprit [Bumrah] and Axar [Patel] coming in, they've all worked with Arun and I am keen to see things moving forward from here.

Hardik made a huge impression in the series...

Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he's showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he's been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day's play with Arun and he didn't flinch once in going out and testing it the same day. That kind of confidence is what you need at this level.

He can add good balance to the attack if you only have to go in with two pacers...

Of course. But look at Shami and Yadav. They have been relentless. Look at the kind of surfaces that were on offer and these two continuously kept clocking between 141 and 145 kmph. To watch them in action on Day 2 of the game was very satisfying, knowing that these tracks hardly gave them any assistance.

And the fielding too... you've been quite focused on that front...

Oh yes. That's what I also talked about in my interview. When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding eleven in the world. The fittest of the lot and that's right up there in the list of priorities.

You really don't mind showering praise on individuals when you have to...

A few good words don't just make your day but they also give you the sense of belonging and confidence to take the next big step forward. A lot is spoken about coaching an international team. This team loves the pressure they face and the players see it as a challenge. Cynicism and negativity can kill all the joy. I'm not that kind of a guy. I look at the glass as being half-full.

And when there's enough trust and confidence in a healthy working relationship, things begin to look so much better from the outside.

Well, the trust is there. I can't speak for the time when I wasn't around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.

What is it about you and this Indian team that they have absolute faith in you?

Well, that is for the players to answer. I have a job to do and in my close to 35-year career as a cricketer and a commentator and the other roles that I've handled, I've always tried to give my best. All I can say is that the sense of trust comes from the players knowing that they have someone around who they can walk up to and discuss anything they want. If I really want to make lives difficult in order to get 100% commitment from the other guy, I can very well do that and everybody in this set-up knows what I'm talking about. Yet, at the same time, I don't believe in unnecessary interference. Everybody in this set-up has a responsibility carved out and come what may , that responsibility needs to be carried out to the best of the ability. My job is to ensure this is happening on a daily basis and outside of this, anything that needs to be done in the interest of the team.

A word on Wriddhiman Saha....

Saha has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He's grown so much in confidence and remember, he's walking into MS' [Dhoni] shoes. He's done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow. The kind of 'keeping he came up with in this series - on the kind of surfaces that were on offer - makes him the No. 1 wicketkeeper in the world right now.

Batting seems to be the last of your worries...

To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you'd do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I'm glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He's got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in.

Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he's in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn't enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day. Hardik's century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going forward by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team.

You keep insisting 'this is Virat's team' and you're just an extension. Can you elaborate?

I've always maintained this, not just now but even in my earlier stint that this is Virat's team. Prior to when he took over as captain, it was MS Dhoni's bunch and he nurtured some of the boys who've prospered today. The captain is the leader of the pack and the coach is an extension of that role, in the sense that it's the coach's responsibility to ensure that everything is in order for the team and its skipper to go and give their best. These are the principles I followed in my previous stint too. Irrespective of how much I or anyone else may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. Too much importance is given to other things, which is unnecessary. What matters is whether there's confidence and trust between all the individuals and that is my responsibility, to ensure there's enough of it.

There are some big Test series coming up next year, followed by the World Cup in 2019. Has the team sorted its priorities?

The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, we must realise that if India need to show their might in the game, achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle. Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it's Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year.

Bad politics behind endless project delays,"In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the example of a railway line between Howrah and Champdanga in Bengal. It was decided in 1975 to put in broadgauge tracks in this 74-km stretch. Part of the project was completed — the rest has been stuck for 42 years. Modi said his monthly reviews of projects have speeded up investment, completion and commissioning of new projects. It is welcome that some projects are getting completed in this fashion. Mere monitoring will not, however, help others get built.

Delays in executing projects do not really highlight the failure of Indians to strategically plan, manage and execute new projects. What it does underline, however, is the trait of overambitious politicians to allocate projects to suit particular constituencies, with scant regard about whether it is possible to execute them all in time.

An over-supply of announcements tends to spread resources like capital, manpower and managerial skills too thin on the ground for any one project. Delay follows. The solution is for politicians to refrain from throwing confetti-showers of projects, which are much more than the capacity of the public or private sector to execute, to impress voters.

Data from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that the value of projects completed every quarter peaked in March 2016, five quarters ago. It has been falling, on average, since then. The last two quarters, from January to June 2017, have been especially bad. CMIE cites the lack of investment appetite and says most projects being finished now were proposed 10 years ago. The government should try to mitigate financial and other risks associated with investments to bring animal spirits back to the business of forming and executing new projects."

Another 15 per cent suffers from arthritis, as per statistics.Today several organizations have realized how non-communicable diseases can plague the future of the country, unless proactive measures are taken. Keeping the health and wellness of their employees in mind, many organizations today, are tying-up with corporate hospitals to set up clinics within their campuses, so that health of employees go uncompromised without wasting vital productive hours cueing up at city hospitals and clinics far away from offices.In a similar initiative, Embassy TechVillage , Marathalli Outer Ring Road has tied-up with Columbia Asia Hospitals to set-up Columbia Clinic within the campus. This single floor clinic with 650 square feet area is equipped with all basic facilities including health consultation, pharmacy, lab sample collection, treatment room and nursing care.“The clinic will cater to the health requirements of 18,000 professionals from companies including Wells Fargo, Cisco, Sony, LG and Flipkart. In this corporate set-up, employees can walk-in anytime during clinic hours. With this, we aim to provide high quality patient care and spread awareness about lifestyle related chronic diseases through regular health sessions at the campus,” said Sujit Paul , Vice President – Operations - Clinics, Pharmacy, MedSupply, Physiotherapy, Columbia Asia Hospitals.A medical officer will be available at the clinic during the day and consultation with specialists can be done with prior appointment. The clinic will be functional between 8 am and 8 pm on weekdays and between 8 am and 2 pm on Saturdays.Speaking about the benefits of having Columbia Clinic within Embassy TechVillage, Mike Holland, CEO, Embassy Office Parks, said, “Embassy strives to provide our 175+ corporate occupiers world class business ecosystems. Workplace health is increasingly recognised as a key service and differentiator provided by the best employers. To support the 200,000+ people working at Embassy TechVillage, we have partnered with Columbia Asia Hospitals, a leading healthcare provider to introduce on-site clinics with a focus on preventive healthcare, on site pharmacy and medical advice. We are sure that these facilities will benefit both employers and employees with productivity and convenience, reducing the need for off-site travel and absence, while also providing best in class healthcare support at the workplace."

"Modi govt’s energy efficiency scheme to enable Rs 1,000 cr investment by 2020, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Modi government’s flagship scheme to ramp up energy efficiency profile of buildings being executed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) will lead to investments of Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years through 2020, an official statement said today.EESL, a joint venture of PSUs under the power ministry, is implementing the Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme which was launched by power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal in May. “Under the programme, EESL intends to bring in investment of around 1,000 crore covering more than 10,000 large government or private buildings by 2020,” the ministry said.EESL plans to retrofit one crore LED lights, 15 lakh energy-efficient ceiling fans and 150,000 lakh energy efficient ACs in buildings. Apart from retrofitting, EESL also aims to widen its services in areas like centralized AC system, Energy Audits, and New Generation Energy Management System in buildings.The finance ministry has issued guidelines for mandatory installation of energy-efficient appliances in all central government buildings across the country as a majority of these buildings are old constructions and, therefore, consume large amount of energy. The finance ministry has directed usage of LED-based lightings and energy-efficient cooling equipment in government buildings will lead to savings through reduction in energy consumption.In order to implement this plan, the Department of Expenditure under Ministry of Finance has decided to take up the services of EESL on nomination basis to assist ministries and departments to retrofit energy-efficient appliances in their premises across the country.The Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme has two business models -- The Energy Servicing Company (ESCO) model where the entire upfront investment is made by EESL and is paid back by the building owner out of the resulting energy savings from the intervention and the Project Management Consultancy (PMC) model where EESL acts as the project management consultant for implementing the project and the client invests the entire project cost and bears one-time PMC charges of EESL.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in January 2015 launched the National LED Programme to facilitate rapid adoption of LED-based home and street lighting across the country. The programme components -- Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) and Street Lighting National Programme (SNLP) of EESL -- are currently under implementation in 29 States and 7 Union Territories."

"The real military truth: On Doklam, stop saying the Chicken’s Neck area is vulnerable: it isn’t","The Doklam confrontation is not over by any means, and no one can say how it will turn out. As the two sides reinforce their positions, the portents are not good. In the meantime, India needs to stop overplaying the vulnerability of the Chicken’s Neck, the narrow corridor between north and northeastern India.

Indian commentary has identified the Chicken’s Neck as the driving concern behind New Delhi’s insistence that it must stand firm in Doklam. The Chicken’s Neck area is the area between Bhutan, China, Nepal and Sikkim in the north and Bangladesh to the south. At its narrowest, between Bangladesh and Nepal it is 14-17 km wide. Beyond this, it is about 200 km by 60 km in area. The strategic argument is that China could use Doklam to thrust through the Chumbi Valley to sever northern from northeastern India.

This is an extremely dubious thesis. It is about as credible as arguing that the Siachen Glacier is vital to the security of Kashmir and northwestern India. For one thing, Indian forces in the Doklam-Sikkim sector are superior to their PLA counterparts, a point that Indian experts never tire of repeating. India clearly has the advantage of the heights, numbers, and logistics. If so, a Chinese breakthrough here is highly unlikely.

But assuming that the PLA does get past our defences, a thrust from Doklam or from the trijunction of Bhutan, China and India will have to traverse 100-130 km of Indian territory, with Indian forces all round. Note that the PLA will have to negotiate winding Indian roads on which there is no place to hide. It cannot get its men and equipment off the road, and Indian long-range artillery, rockets and attack aircraft will pick them off in a “turkey shoot”.

If the PLA gets to flatter land, it will be able to fan out. However, by the time it does this, Indian forces from both flanks will have massed. The Chinese may even be vulnerable in their rear, with the Indian army harrowing them from behind. Again, long-range artillery, rockets, and aircraft will have a field day.

Assuming that nevertheless Chinese forces make it to flatter ground and try to consolidate their positions, they will face an enormous logistical problem. Their supplies will have to come all the way from Tibet. In military parlance, India will have the “interior” supply lines which are much shorter while the Chinese will have the exterior lines going back to the Tibetan plateau. As a result, their logistics will be horribly exposed to Indian interdiction. The PLA forces in the Chicken’s Neck area will gradually be starved of supplies and will be destroyed or captured.

Another possibility is that the Chinese would try to take and hold this area with special forces that are parachuted behind Indian lines. Chinese special forces have grown and improved in capability over the past decade, but they are not much more than a short-operations force against paramilitary or insurgent opposition. Their ability to hold ground against regular military forces and expand their operations is extremely limited.

This then is the commonsense military truth. It is not clear why Indian analysts, including unnamed or retired military analysts, continue to propagate the myth that the Chicken’s Neck is vulnerable, but it does us no good to repeat this myth endlessly. Certainly, the PLA knows that a thrust here would be suicidal.

Having said that, there is one circumstance in which the Chicken’s Neck would be vulnerable: all-out war with China. In that case, India would be fighting desperately in many sectors, and it might not be able to defend the Chicken’s Neck sufficiently. If so, the Doklam road would be of little or no relevance since the entire border would be in flames and India’s military situation would be perilous across hundreds of kilometres."

"pharmaceutical: No more freebies: India plans crackdown on marketing by drugmakers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","By Zeba Siddiqui

MUMBAI - India, one of the world's largest markets for pharmaceuticals, is drawing up its first set of marketing rules for drugmakers, restricting gifts and trips offered to doctors and pharmacists to 1,000 rupees ($15), according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters.

While such rules are common elsewhere in the world and adhered to by large pharmaceutical companies, they are not set in stone in India, where campaigners have long demanded a crackdown on unethical selling practices. These have included gifts ranging from electrical appliances to foreign junkets to encourage doctors and pharmacists to prescribe and stock certain medications.

Currently, India has only a voluntary marketing code that critics say is ineffective.

""In India, corruption and bribery of doctors is widespread,"" said Samiran Nundy, one of India's leading gastrointestinal surgeons. ""I've seen a range of ways in which this works, from presents to doctors to paying for them to attend conferences in places like Thailand.""

""It's great that marketing rules are coming into place, but there are a huge number of regulations in India that are not enforced,"" he added. ""I hope that these will be enforced.""

Apart from limiting marketing spending, the draft proposal drawn up the Department of Pharmaceuticals and being reviewed by India's law ministry would also forbid drugmakers from making misleading claims around the curative abilities and efficacy of drugs.

The rules also impose strict limitations on the number of trial samples offered to doctors.

An official at the Department of Pharmaceuticals declined to comment on the specifics of the draft, but told Reuters that the order was being reviewed.

The official, who asked not to be named, said no timeline has yet been set on the implementation of the new rules.

According to the draft seen by Reuters, a failure to abide by the rules will result in a marketing ban on a drugmaker for more than a year depending on the degree of the violation, and the confiscation of ""all packets of the highest selling brand of drugs"" made by that company.

The seized drugs will be handed over for use at government hospitals across the country.

Companies can turn a marketing suspension order into a cash fine, according to the proposal. They will have to pay penalties of between 500,000 rupees ($7,800) and 100,000,000 rupees ($1.56 million) to reverse a marketing suspension order, depending on the severity.

MANDATORY CODE

In a letter last year, Tapan Sen, a member of Rajya Sabha, urged the government to act on drafting a mandatory code on the marketing of pharmaceuticals, citing irregular practices by several companies.

Indian media reported that the letter said the country's largest drugmaker, Sun Pharma, Abbott India and privately-held Macleods Pharmaceuticals were among drugmakers found to have sent doctors on ""pleasure trips.""

Abbott said at the time that it had a strict policy against providing gifts and other incentives to doctors, while Macleods refuted the allegations.

A Sun spokesman told Reuters the company organises 'continuous medical education' programmes to educate doctors, not promote its products, and these are compliant with the voluntary marketing guidelines set by the government in 2015.

The current draft says companies will be allowed to organise screening camps or awareness campaigns at public health centres, but it bars advertising by stealth and mandates that doctors involved in such events be paid commensurate to their average daily income.

To ensure implementation of the rules, an 'Ethics Compliance Officer' of the rank of joint secretary to the Indian government would be appointed.

Pharmaceutical marketing practices have long been a subject of controversy globally. In India, where health insurance is scarce and many rely on pharmacists for medical advice, critics say sketchy practices have led to the over-prescription of strong cocktail drugs, causing drug-resistance.

GlaxoSmithKline was battered by a bribery scandal in China that landed it with a record $490 million fine in 2014.

It went on to slash the number of sales reps and overhaul its business globally, stopping sales-based incentives for drug reps and reducing paid junkets for doctors.

"Single use medical devices: Mumbai: FIRs against 37 hospitals for reusing devices, patients to be reimbursed, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed complaints against 37 hospitals across the state for reusing single-use medical devices and overcharging patients, said minister for consumer protection Girish Bapat . The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."
"At last, India gets genuinely serious about companies flouting mining and environment laws","By Himangshu Watts

The landmark judgement of the Supreme Court imposing penalties of an estimated Rs 25,000 crore on illegal mining merits serious reading by the entire corporate sector, and not just by those who extract mineral wealth.

Two aspects of the verdict stand out. First, the verdict takes environmental law enforcement by the Centre and the highest judicial authority to anew high, which is a very strong deterrent against such practices in the future. This strong message will protect the environment and clean up the poisonous air in cities more effectively than some outrageous, controversial and ill-conceived steps taken by various authorities in recent years.

Second, the court has ordered heavy expenditure for the welfare of tribal people in affected areas. This reinforces the GoI’s declared strategy of targeting and extracting ill-gotten wealth to help the poor, whether by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, or with the goods and services tax (GST).

A crucial aspect of the court case that needs to be highlighted is the fact that the mines ministry, after Piyush Goyal took charge of its affairs, dramatically changed the relatively lenient position that the previous government had taken in the matter of companies violating green laws applicable to the sector. In doing this, GoI showed its determination to resist strong pressures.

Conventionally, mining was deemed illegal only if ores were extracted without a mining lease. Under the mining law, the penalty was equal to the entire output from such an operation. However, once the lease was obtained, even if the mining operation ravaged forests, made the air unbreathable and degraded the environment to make thousands of crores, the penalty under the environment law was a laughable Rs 50,000. This built a very strong business case to start mining without waiting for green clearances.

The government argued before the Supreme Court in January that extracting minerals without the necessary green clearance should be deemed illegal not just under the environmental law but also under the mining law that imposes back-breaking penalties for default. The Supreme Court has upheld this view.

It’s Mine, Not Yours

This means that even if you have a mining lease, any extraction without forest and environment clearance is illegal and the state must recover the value of the entire output from the defaulter.

Further, the court has ordered that the hefty penalty must be used very transparently for the development of tribal areas where the mines are located. It has ordered that the “very large amounts” that will flow to Odisha after the verdict must be kept in a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To ensure that the funds are used for the benefits of tribal people in affected areas, it has asked the state’s chief secretary to file an affidavit stating the work done and audited accounts of the SPV.

For those who think they can make millions without caring for the environment, the court did not mince words. It delivered the message in the first paragraph of the judgement, “Lessees… in Odisha have rapaciously mined iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area.” Some steps taken to help the local people, the court said, seemed “not more than a drop in the ocean —also too little, too late”.

The stern words from the highest judicial authority in the country are abreath of fresh air in the otherwise polluted approach toward green issues some authorities have demonstrated in recent years.

On top of the hall of shame is the Delhi government’s ill-conceived oddeven scheme that banned half the cars in the city on alternate days, but had no problems with smoky and noisy diesel generators or smoke-spewing, overloaded trucks.

Then there was the ban on 10-yearold diesel cars, which were sold in full compliance of the prevailing emission norms and a declaration to customers that these cars will be legally allowed for 15 years. It didn’t matter to the authorities that a newer car that is not properly maintained will pollute the air much more. Or that the actual emission is more important than the age.

The problem with such steps is that it creates mass public ill-will towards the noble cause of environmental protection simply because some authority has caused severe hardship with steps that scientists know wouldn’t clean the air. Such orders actually damage the environment because they make it difficult for political authorities to protect the environment when the common man thinks he is being short-changed.

Green and Bear It

In contrast, the Supreme Court’s latest verdict on mining, and GoI’s submission early this year, is a concrete step that will help the environment, even as some mining companies have genuine grievances.

The mining industry fears the verdict will disrupt business and that some mines may shut down. There are some legitimate grouses. It takes ages to get environmental clearances. Often, land is not available for compensatory afforestation. At times, clearances are not renewed even if there is no change in mining operations or output.

Legitimate concerns must be addressed. But for the crooks who ravage the environment, the message from the Supreme Court and the government is clear: if abiding by the law means shutting down your business, so be it."

Hans-Peter Hutter will present the study this coming Tuesday (22 August, 16-17:30 hrs, Flora Hall) as part of a partner session at the European Forum Alpbach under the title ""The sports club as a health driver "".The main health impacts from the 1,685 reviewed papers on the subject of ""Sports Clubs and Health"" are as follows:* Being an active member of a sports club during adolescence helps to integrate a person into society ""and helps to stop young people from going down the wrong path,"" says Hutter.* Active membership of a sports club increases a young person’s self-confidence – ""especially in the case of girls"".* Active membership of a sports club has a beneficial effect upon well-being and mental health (e.g. vitality). Says Hutter: ""These effects are much greater than those resulting from individually organised sporting activities.""* Members of sports clubs are generally (more) content with their lives.* Being an active member of a sports club is fun and also provides socialisation. This in turn leads to more regular sporting activities.The beneficial health impacts of the social aspect of sports clubs were observed in all age groups and in both genders.According to the authors (Hans-Peter Hutter and Peter Wallner from MedUni Vienna, Anna Wanka from Vienna University; Christian Gormász, Anna-Maria Wiesner and Rainer Rößlhuber from BSO), medicine often underestimates social aspects and rarely mentions their positive impact upon health – and this equally applies to sport.Finally, recent studies have also indicated that an active social life is beneficial in the prevention of dementia. Says Hutter: ""Social contacts keep you vital, because you have to respond to your opposite number. This improves your cognitive abilities. Playing sport in a club has general psychosocial benefits – that is also a unique feature of a group activity.""Being in a Sports Club is Good for the Soul"
"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."

"nuclear medicine: Besides newer isotopes, nuclear medicine is all set to revolutionize the diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities: Dr Mythri Shankar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Senior Consultant, Nuclear Medicine Department,, Bengaluru, talks about the role and advancements in PET-CT. Edited excerpts:PET-CT is a new hybrid imaging modality and is mainly used for the staging of head and neck cancer in particular, meaning how far the cancer has spread; looking at TNM staging, the entire T stage which is a tumour extent and the nodal involvement. Most common sites would be the lungs, the bones and PET-CT scans offer a one stop scan where we can image the entire body and check for increased focal or metabolic activity or glycolysis which indicates presence of tumour in those areas. It is also very good for restaging to assess how the patient has responded to that particular type of treatment. We look for fall in glycolytic activity which helps us assess the treatment response of a metabolic level be it partial or complete.Something that we are seeing or trying to explore in head and neck cancer is tumour volume estimation but there is a little bit more value addition that PET-CT could bring into the picture by estimating the tumour volume to be different than the CET estimated volume. It could allow us to cover more area of treatment or give lesser amount of radiation therefore preventing complication that could happen from radiation therapy.Thyroid cancers form a very important group of head and neck cancers and they are a little different when you compare them to other head and neck cancers. The point being they are excruciatingly iodine sensitive and they pick up iodine. We have a lot of scans in nuclear medicine which use iodine just like PET-CT to stage the extent of disease in the patient and that we have been using so far but now sometimes what we have seen is certain types of thyroid cancers differentiate. The differentiated types of thyroid cancer do not pick up iodine as well as some of the other common groups do. Here we need to still go ahead and check how far the cancer has spread and these cancers are not iodine avid. Such group of patients can benefit from what we call FDG PET scan which measures the glycolytic activity in the tumour cell and helps us stage and treat the patient better.Nuclear medicine is basically use of isotope within the human body, we use it both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, we can diagnoses using it in scans and we can use it in treating the patient. Radioiodine ablation has been the main stream of theranostics just like diagnostics where we use it for therapy. When we do a radioiodine ablation in thyroid cancer there is a also a concept where we use a recombinant TSH, where we use that to stimulate the uptake of the radioiodine therapy which we give and it allows us to makes the procedure faster. This is not new it has been there and more people are starting to use it. Except for the cost factor it is a great tool to have where we can use exogenous, recombinant TSH to stimulate the gland and also use radioiodine therapy in a better way.Futuristically, we are seeing a lot more nuclear medicine and PET-CT scan centres in India. Today we have close to 200 and just in Bangalore we have close to 10 combinations of nuclear medicines and PET-CT centres. We are seeing a lot of newer isotopes, lot of finer techniques with more targeted, diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities."
Motorola Patented A Smartphone Display That Can Heal Its Cracked Screen Using Your Body Heat,"Because it’s so heartbreaking dropping an unblemished phone and then lifting it up to see your shattered display, Motorola is doing what it can to make sure we never have to live through that tragedy.

Image courtesy: United States Patent and Trademark Office

The company is looking into developing a smartphone that can heal its own cracked display over time, according to a newly published patent.

Motorola’s process relies on something they call a “shape memory polymer”, a material that can be deformed and then recover its original shape through a process called thermal cycling. Basically, rapidly heating up this kind of material makes the piece revert to its original form, healing any cracks and nicks along the way.

This sort of material could be placed as a protective layer over an LCD or LED display. According to Motorola, you won’t even necessarily need to externally heat the layer to fix it, a user’s body heat should also be enough.

Unfortunately though, as much of a godsend as it seems, you won’t see anything like this in smartphones any time soon. A pliable polymer layer may actually look and feel a lot cheaper than Gorilla Glass, which means users won’t be too enamored and therefore manufacturers won’t use them. However, perhaps they can instead be used for kid-friendly smart devices, until the science graduates to a point where they possibly become viable in high-end products."
Let the poor sell their children as a poverty alleviation measure,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on health, in its report on the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016, has said that women should be allowed to rent their womb and become surrogate mothers for total strangers in exchange for a hefty sum of money, a rate that will be fixed by the government. The panel was of the view that “economic opportunities available to surrogates through surrogacy services” should be permitted. The Committee observed that if many impoverished women are able to provide their children with education, construct home, start a small business, etc. by resorting to surrogacy, there is no reason to take this away from them.

If surrogacy is an economic opportunity, why not selling of babies or children? If a couple is in dire need of money and the sale of children can help alleviate their poverty, why can’t they do it? Every time they needed money, they could produce a baby and sell it, or sell one of the already existing babies/children and reduce their own burden and also help a childless family in the process. India could be selling its excess population of poor children all over the world perhaps. It could become a market leader. It could help reduce the population and could be the best poverty alleviation scheme with no input of government’s scarce resources.

This reminds one of the satirical essay by Jonathan Swift called A Modest Proposal or to give the full title- A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick. Swift’s recommendation for impoverished Irish was to ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. “A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled…,” said Swift. The standing committee’s proposal seems no less satirical, except that they are dead serious.

“For any woman who is going through surrogacy, there is a certain cost and certain loss of health involved. Not only will she be absent from her work, but will also be away from her husband and would not be able to look after her own children,” says the committee. It therefore recommended that surrogate mother should be adequately and reasonably compensated. Actually, allowing them to sell their own babies might be so much simpler! No absence from work. No neglecting the children she chooses to keep. She is in fact earning some money for them.

The committee goes on to express great concern over the fact that surrogate mothers could be exploited as “there are enormous inequalities in the bargaining power of surrogates vis-à-vis medical clinics and commissioning parents due to surrogate’s illiteracy, socio-economic marginalization and lack of access to legal representation”. They have a neat solution for it. The government can just fix a minimum retail price for the surrogacy. “The relevant authorities should fix the amount of compensation” says the committee and adds that the fixed amount should not be subject to bargaining between the surrogate mother and her client. No more worries about finding employment for poor women or about Skill India. The government could help fix a minimum rate for selling children too.

In fact, why only women and children, maybe all poor people could sell one kidney each at government fixed rates. Maybe some portion of their liver too or any other body parts they can afford to spare. The government could put out a rate list and ensure the money is paid. It could have differential pricing for foreigners, NRIs and Indians. The government could even tax the transactions, differentially of course, and earn some money from it. The options this committee report opens up for the country’s poor is mind boggling- a happy problem of plenty?"

Manipur shows how to improve health measures in the face of huge challenges,"The tragic events in Gorakhpur showed up India’s poor capability of meaningfully improving health outcomes of its citizens. But all recent news on the healthcare front has not been negative. Manipur, a state often torn apart by internal divisions, has provided a reason for optimism

The latest data on infant mortality rate showed that Manipur, along with Goa, recorded the lowest infant mortality rate in India. Goa is among India’s most developed states and one of the richest in terms of per capita income. Its impressive performance, therefore, does not come as a surprise. It is Manipur’s performance that is remarkable.

First, why is infant mortality rate (IMR) important? The following explanation by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides the answer.

“The death of a baby before his or her first birthday is called infant mortality. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths that occur for every 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a nation, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants.”

A look at the data showed that Manipur’s IMR is 9, while Kerala, a benchmark for health indicators, had a mortality rate of 12.

The most impressive aspect of Manipur’s performance is that it has consistently lowered its IMR over the last three years, while some states have states such as Bihar or Uttarakhand have stagnated or slipped.

Manipur’s performance in IMR deserves a lot more attention and study. It is unique because it’s far better than its neighbor, Mizoram. This suggests that the cause for the impressive performance is state-specific rather than being broadly region-specific.

One explanation which has been offered in the past links the state’s performance to the status of women in society. According to this explanation, Manipur’s women have relatively more freedom and decision making powers which translates into better choices in this area.

Whatever the reasons, Manipur’s performance should inspire other states."

"Oil steady as high U.S. output balances big crude stockpiles draw, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Christopher Johnson

LONDON: Oil prices steadied on Thursday after U.S. data showed a big fall in crude stockpiles but also an increase in production, taking U.S. crude output to its highest in more than two years.

Brent crude was down 5 cents at $50.22 a barrel by 1055 GMT. U.S. light crude was 10 cents lower at $46.68.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday.

Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed commercial U.S. crude stocks have fallen by almost 13 percent from their peaks in March to 466.5 million barrels. Stocks are now lower than in 2016.

But U.S. oil output is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.

U.S. production jumped by 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.75 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.

""The EIA data suggest the U.S. oil market is becoming more balanced, with crude inventories falling,"" said Tamas Varga, senior market analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

""But the big jump in production was the focus.""

Rising U.S. output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.

They have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.

William O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, U.S. stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.

""The pace of the declines indicates that OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,"" he added.

Brent prices are down almost 12 percent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.

Oil producers have enjoyed years of rocketing demand, fuelled largely by China's voracious thirst coming from over 2 million new car sales a month.

But this boom is coming to an end as its vehicle sales slow in a maturing market, and as cars become more efficient and start using alternative fuels.

""Gasoline consumption growth in China is set to see a marked slowdown over the coming years, due to macroeconomic headwinds, improving fuel economy and competition from alternative fuels,"" BMI Research said."
FIFA U-17 World Cup: Challenges of putting together a squad,"By Joy Bhattacharjya

The most challenging task while hosting a Junior World Cup, especially for developing football countries, is putting up a competitive squad. All the remaining preparations will not have much value if the Indian team doesn’t compete against its opponents in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. FIFA does not publish junior rankings, but in the list of football nations, five of the top ranked FIFA countries will be in India come October, including World No 1, Brazil. India’s group features the 8th, 26th and 50th ranked countries, and its no help that the lowest-rated team, Ghana, have been monsters in this competition with titles in 1991 and 1995.

The process for putting together this particular team started in April 2014, just a few months after India was awarded the tournament, when a group of 30 odd boys started practicing together in the AIFF academy in Goa. While there have been dropouts due to injury and loss of form, and fresh talent has also been unearthed over the years, at least half the squad is still from the original thirty. Most of the original boys were selected by a set of scouts led by the then Technical Director, Scott O’Donell. The challenges were immense. The first and most important issue was age. Almost 50 per cent of the boys selected could not provide birth certificates. And a fair number of those who seemed to be fine on paper then failed the compulsory wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test that is the most accepted age test in junior football.

In addition, state federation heads were often keen to put forward their favourites, rather than the best players in the state. Finally, the biggest conundrum was whether to select just the best players or also start looking at the players from the point of view of the position they could play. From over two thousand potential candidates, 29 were finally selected, with a shortage of quality left foot players. Almost half that number came from the North East, with Manipur contributing the most players, including the core of the current midfield — Suresh Wangjam, Amarjit Kiyam and Jackson Singh.

While the team started practicing and playing tournaments almost immediately, the process of scouting for new players continued. Abhishek Yadav joined as the CEO of the AIFF U-17 team in 2016, and set upon a punishing schedule of trials. Since June last year, he has personally seen more than twelve thousand boys, many from the smaller districts of traditional powerhouse states like Bengal and Kerala. Aniket Jadhav from Kolhapur was just one of the boys selected, who forced himself into a first XI position in the team almost immediately. The other push has been the online portal, where players of India origin from around the world can upload their match footage for a chance to play for India. Defender Namit Deshpande from New Jersey is one of the two players from the Americas, the other being towering 6’5” goalkeeper Sunny Dhaliwal from Canada.

The exposure given to this team has been unprecedented in Indian football. Over the past couple of years, they have played tournaments and matches in Germany, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Russia and also participated in the AFC U-16 qualifying tournament in Goa. The team has competed against the likes of Brazil, USA and Russia and while a lot of the matches ended in defeat, the opposing coaches were often impressed by the skills on view. More recently, the team under coach Luis Norton drew 1-1 against a full strength Chile, among the top 10 sides in international soccer, in a tournament in Mexico.

India have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, senior or junior, men’s or women’s, so the pressure on these thirty is absolutely unprecedented. Talismanic senior striker Sunil Chhetri spoke of how he would cheerfully trade his entire international career for one shot at a World Cup, and these boys bear the burden of all those unfulfilled dreams.

But they have a few things going for them as well. They have played for a long time together and have had enough time to gel as a unit. They have also competed against the best in the world from different football ‘gharanas,’ — from short passing South American and Spanish teams to athletic long ball teams like Tanzania and the German Bundesliga squads, so there aren’t any real surprises. And finally, they will easily be the fittest Indian team ever to play a World Cup, going at full tilt well into stoppage time.

Unfortunately, the phone has been delayed and is now set to launch in one week, at the same time as the Galaxy Note 8, followed likely by the LG V30 and Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL the week after, as well as the upcoming iPhone 8 and more.

The Essential Phone features a QHD (2560x1312) edge-to-edge display, with rounded corners and ultra-narrow bezels in a titanium build. It has a dual rear camera system with a 13MP RGB sensors, and 13MP monochrome, as well as an 8MP front camera. The device packs a 2.45GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with a Adreno 540 GPU and 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB internal storage.

According to an email registered customers received from the company, the smartphone will ship within seven days, at a buy price of $699 (approximately Rs 44,800). Though some of the other offerings coming out soon may be more expensive than the Essential, they’re more powerful devices from tried and tested brands, as opposed to a startup. It all comes down to whether Essential’s camera and it’s touted accessories can carry it ahead of the pack."
"West Bengal seeks Centre's relaxation to access clean energy fund, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Kolkata: The Centre is yet to respond to West Bengal's demand for relaxation to access clean energy fund for small solar power projects in the state.

""The Centre is asking us to set up large solar parks in the state, but for that we need large tracts of land which is hard to get. So, we are asking it to consider funding small solar projects,"" state Power Minister Shobhandeb Chattopadhayay said at CII organised 'Energy Conclave'.

""But, we are still to hear from the Centre,"" he said.

He said for each megawatt of solar project four acres is required. The state faced resistance while getting land for even sub-stations and the Trinamool Congress government had repeatedly said that it would not take land forcibly for any projects.

West Bengal power department, he said, is planning to set up a solar park to support a second pump storage power plant in the state and is seeking grant under the clean energy fund of the Centre.

Chattopadhayay emphasied on the need of technology and modernisation to reduce transmission and distribution losses.

The state government, he said, focusses on cheap and sustainable power to all and provides subsidies of Rs 800 crore per annum."

"GST: Arun Jaitley indicates scope for rationalisation of rates under GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said there is scope to rationalise goods and services tax ( GST ) and rolling 12 per cent and 18 per cent slabs into one as implementation of the country’s most comprehensive indirect tax reforms progresses.“I do concede that as it (GST) moves forward, there will be scope for rationalising the rates. There, probably, will be scope that the two standard rates of 12% and 18 per cent, after some time, could be clubbed into one. That is a fair possibility and a suggestion,” Jaitley said replying to debate on the two bills related to GST in J&K.Central Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir ) Bill, 2017 and the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir) Bill, 2017 were later passed by a voice vote.The current GST has 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent rates, plus one for luxury and sin goods. There are some that are zero rated, or nil rate.Jaitley said if the two rates had been merged into one its inflationary effect would have been high. “Therefore, we did not get into this exercise,” he said responding to criticism over several slabs in the GST rates. Jaitley said there can’t be a single slab in a country like India which has a large population below poverty line (BPL). As an example, he said a hawai chappal and a BMW car could not be taxed at the same rate.The finance minister also wondered why certain manufacturers have hiked the prices of small hybrid cars even though the duty has been reduced. He added that a hybrid car is priced higher and those who buy it can afford to pay a little more. He said one of the GST objectives is to assist domestic products and the government does not want to just allow cheap foreign products to come in.Jaitley said the passage of the bills will ensure greater economic integration of the state with rest of the country. He asserted that special status of Jammu and Kashmir was “never meant to create economic impediment” as he maintained that the GST is in the larger interest of traders and consumers of J&K.Jaitley said it was a positive step that J&K has been integrated with GST and the dream of one tax regime is now met, hitting out at the Congress party for its reported claim that GST would infringe upon the special status of J&K.“If they (J&K) didn’t integrate, the traders would not have got input credit and the tax on final products would have been higher... That would have made products costlier and consumers would have to pay more,” the minister said. “J&K is a consumer state and GST being a destinationbased tax, revenues of the state would increase.” He added that if GST was not put in place in J&K, then customers would prefer to buy products like cars and refrigerators from outside the state."
"Industries to benefit as Tamil Nadu cuts cross-subsidy surcharges, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission TNERC ) has brought down cross-subsidy surcharges (CSS) in the range of Rs1.6 to Rs2.5 per unit and directed the state’s power utility Tangedco to reduce power tariffs for industrial and commercial consumers. The high cross-subsidy surcharge was one of the frequent complaints of the industry and commercial establishments.The revision follows the National Tariff Policy 2016 suggesting a new formula for determination of CSS at a maximum of 20% of the tariff. With the new CSS, industry will be able to purchase power at a lower rate compared to the present rate even from outside the grid.Cross subsidy surcharge is levied by state discoms to recover the cost of supplying subsidised power to a section of the population. In Tamil Nadu, subsidised power is supplied to domestic consumers up to a certain slab of consumption, besides hut dwellers and farmers.“CSS determination should not be violated by the commission at least in this tariff order. The tariff should be designed in such a way that it supports the development of industries in the state,” the TNERC said. The per-unit cost for industrial consumers was around Rs7.48 out of which CSS was Rs3.51.“According to the load generation balance report, the state has surplus power. Thus, the power cost has to be reduced instead of Tangedco’s proposal for maintaining the tariffs at the existing level,” said the commission.Industrialists and power experts are elated with the lowering of the CSS. “The TNERC has reduced CSS and aligned it with the National Tariff Policy 2016 and other state discom rates. TNEB will be the first entity to benefit from the lowering of CSS as it will be able to sell power, especially renewable power, to states which are in need,” TVS Capital Funds MD Gopal Srinivasan told TOI.The commission said the base tariff of Rs6.35 per unit for industrial consumers was very high compared to tariffs for other consumers. Moreover, the CSS made it impractical for industrial consumers to buy from power exchanges or generate within the state under the captive power scheme at Rs5.25 a unit, it said."
GOD’S OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura’s alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.“Monkeys.They are chashma chor — spectacle stealing thieves,” he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:“You can’t blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.” We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna’s chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone — holy men, devotees and tourists — entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city’s Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister’s offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings — temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

SL name ODI squad; skipper Tharanga calls for support

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 09:03 PM

Upul Tharanga urged the country to rally behind the team while stating that every team in each sport goes through a rough phase. © AFP

In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's abysmal 3-0 Test series loss at the hands of the No. 1 ranked Test side India, ODI skipper Upul Tharanga called for the nation's support and urged the fans to rally behind the team in testing times as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match ODI series on Tuesday (August 15).

ODI Squad: Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

With Asela Gunaratne yet to recover from the thumb injury he sustained during the first Test, the selectors have recalled allrounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana for the five-match series. While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.

Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.

""Every team goes through a rough patch,"" skipper Tharanga said. ""This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

Sri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.

""Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.""

The skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. ""Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

""The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

""Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI & T20 teams, I want to appeal to each every one of you,"" concluded Tharanga.

"Tata Group: Tata Sons to scrap all business dealings with Cyrus Mistry's group, putting huge money at risk, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: The board of Tata Sons under N Chandrasekaran has ordered its group companies to scrap all business dealings with Cyrus and Shapoor Mistry’s SP Group , putting at risk transactions worth hundreds of crores of rupees.The move is a significant step towards terminating all ties with the Shapoorji Pallonji Group and indicates that the battle between the two groups, which was ignited when Cyrus Mistry was sacked as Tata Sons chairman in October last year, is showing no signs of coming to an end. SP Group holds about 18.4% in Tata Sons.Almost 50 companies of the SP Group will be affected by the Tata Sons board decision taken on August 9. Cyrus Mistry and elder brother Shapoor Mistry each own half of the privately-owned SP Group.Emails sent to Tata Sons didn’t elicit any response till press time. ET reviewed a copy of the letter sent to one of the Tata group companies asking it to take necessary steps to terminate all business dealings with SP Group.A top Tata Group source said the decision to terminate all forms of business dealings, whether directly or indirectly, through contracts or sub-contracting arrangements, with the SP Group came after ‘disparaging’ statements made against Tata Sons by Cyrus Mistry and his associates, with the intention of casting a ‘negative light’ on the Tata Group.The directive has been sent to all group companies including Tata Steel, Tata Power , Tata Chemicals and Tata Motors. Smaller group firms such as Voltas and Trent, which is chaired by Noel Tata, half-brother to Ratan Tata and brother-in-law of the Mistry brothers, have also received the order.All Tata Group companies are said to be acting on the Tata Sons directive, which came to them on August 14.Key SP group companies to be affected by this letter include Afcons Infrastructure, Eureka Forbes and Forbes and Company Ltd. It remains to be seen whether the SP Group will challenge the Tata Sons move in the courts.“As the promoter and principal shareholder of your company and as the custodian of the ‘Tata’ brand, Tata Sons does not support any businesses dealing in any form, whether directly or indirectly, through contracts or subcontracting arrangements,” the directive signed by FN Subedar, chief operating officer of Tata Sons, says. The letter says that (Cyrus) Mistry has been aided and supported by the SP Group in his “hostile approach” to the Tata Group, a key reason for the Tata group to feel aggrieved.It details that certain SP Group companies have presented to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the public at large, an “incorrect and distorted version of facts” pertaining to the business and affairs of Tata Sons and certain Tata operating companies.By adopting such an adversarial approach of deliberately misrepresenting matters in public and in the ongoing litigation, Mistry and SP Group have attempted to damage the reputation of Tata Sons and several Tata operating companies and the goodwill associated with the ‘Tata’ brand, the letter says. Mistry, the letter says, has engaged in such conduct with an intention of casting a negative light on Tata Sons and Tata Group companies. The hostile conduct was the reason why Mistry was removed as a director of Tata Sons by its shareholders, it adds.When Cyrus Mistry took over as chairman of Tata Sons, it was agreed that the Tatas will curtail and cease all business dealings with each other due to possible conflicts of interest. Mistry was no longer a representative of the SP Group but represented the interests of Tata Trusts and other shareholders in the holding company.However, it is now learnt that this rule affected only the new manufacturing and construction contracts between the groups while existing arrangements in other areas were allowed to continue.Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Trusts exchanged a few letters with Mistry in 2013 seeking details of transactions of the SP Group with Tata Group companies. Shapoor Mistry is running the operations at SP Group ever since brother Cyrus was appointed the chairman of Tata Sons."
"Coalscam: CBI supplies docs to Jindal, other accused, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The CBI has informed a special court here that the copies of the charge sheet and all the other documents have been handed over to the accused, including Congress leader and industrialist Naveen Jindal, in a coal scam case.

The CBI told this to Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar who had earlier taken strong objection to non-supply of the papers by the central probe agency. The judge posted the matter for further hearing on September 25.

The documents along with the supplementary charge sheet were filed against five accused persons who were granted bail on May 25 in the case pertaining to the allocation of Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in Jharkhand.

Those granted the relief were Jindal Steel's adviser Anand Goel, Gurgaon-based Green Infra's Vice-President Siddharth Madra, Nihar Stocks Ltd Director BSN Suryanarayan, Mumbai-based KE International's Chief Financial Officer Rajeev Aggarwal and Mumbai's Essar Power Ltd Executive Vice-Chairman Sushil Kumar Maroo.

The names of these five persons were given by Suresh Singhal, a chartered accountant, who was chargesheeted by the CBI as accused in the case but had later turned an approver. The court had summoned the five persons as accused after taking cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet filed by the CBI on March 24.

Besides Jindal, the case also involves former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao and ex-Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda as accused.

CBI had alleged that Koda had favoured Jindal group firms -- Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and Gagan Sponge Iron Pvt Ltd (GSIPL) -- in allocation of Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in Jharkhand.

All the accused have denied the allegations levelled against them and said there was no evidence to show that there was any conspiracy during the coal block allocation process.

The CBI recently filed another charge sheet against Jindal and five others, including Goel and Maroo, for allegedly cheating the government by misrepresenting facts to get the Madhya Pradesh based Urtan North coal block. They have been summoned as accused for September 4 in the case."

How to help bankrupt realtor’s customers,"Insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech have left over 30,000 home buyers in the lurch. They need more than state sympathy. Home buyers have been advised to file a claim with the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal. However, as unsecured claimants, home buyers have limited rights under the bankruptcy code. They are akin to customers who have placed orders and paid advances to a manufacturing company that goes under liquidation. In the pecking order of rights, the code allows the proceeds from the sale of assets to be distributed to secured lenders (read: banks), to pay off workmen’s dues for a period of 24 months before the liquidation commencement date, to pay wages and any unpaid dues owed to employees other than workmen, and to clear financial debts owed to unsecured creditors.

How can home buyers who have made payment in full or in part be given their homes? The assets now belong to the banks. If the liquidation proceeds are large enough to pay off secured creditors and employees and still have enough left over to repay home buyers their infructuous advances, well and good. Suppose that is not the case. What incentive do the banks or the IRP have to invest fresh funds to complete the construction of homes, payments for which have gone to the bankrupt firm and will not come to the new owner?

Why should banks part with assets that they have taken possession of under the law, to recover their unpaid dues? Bankers are unlikely to be moved by home buyers’ tears: the CBI might raid them for causing an avoidable loss.

There is one way out: raise the floor area ratio for the project, build and sell additional homes to generate the funds needed to complete stalled construction."
"Ramp up capacity to achieve 100GW solar target by 2022: Study, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: India will need to add over 15,000 MW solar capacity every year to achieve the target of 1,00,000 MW by 2022, a study has said.

The country's installed solar capacity fell short of target of 17,000 MW by the end of the financial year 2016-17, according to the joint study undertaken by NEC Technologies and industry body Assocham.

""The country will need to significantly ramp up the pace of solar capacity additions by 10,000 MW this fiscal and over 15,000 MW per year to meet the 2022 target of 1,00,000 MW (100GW), which the government set up in 2014,"" it said.

The biggest technological issue in terms of solar is the efficiency of solar cells, the study said.

""Currently, the efficiency ranges from 12-20 per cent, though this continues to improve. The rest of the energy striking the panel is either reflected or is wasted as heat. The main issue with efficiency is that higher efficiency solar panels cannot be commercially mass produced,"" it said.

To achieve the 1,00,000 GW target by 2022, the focus has slightly shifted from indigenous manufacturing as policies to curb the imports from other countries are not benefiting the domestic manufacturing.

Furthermore, the increase in taxes in the GST structure in solar from zero per cent to 5 per cent, coupled with reduced taxes in coal from 11.69 per cent to 5 per cent, may lead to slow adoption of solar in the Indian energy sector, the study said.

Lack of uniform policies across sectors and implementation issues is also an area of concern, it said.

""In India subsidy structure is complex and there are involvement of multiple agencies. Land allotment is a long procedure in India, which requires approvals at different levels from authorities.""

Currently, the foreign investment in Indian solar industry is less than 20 per cent, the report said.

Even 100 per cent FDI under automatic route and 74 per cent through foreign equity participation in a joint venture (without approval) have not paved the way for significant foreign investments in this sector, it added."

China's CEFC in early talks to buy Rosneft stake,"Hong Kong/Beijing: CEFC China Energy, which has grown from a niche oil trader to a sprawling energy conglomerate, is in talks to acquire a stake in Russian state oil giant Rosneft, three people with direct knowledge of the discussions said.

The people said senior executives at both companies were in preliminary discussions, though there have already been two meetings between CEFC Chairman Ye Jianmin and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin since July.

It was not immediately clear how much CEFC would invest in Rosneft, nor if the Chinese group would buy new shares or existing stock in the parent company. One person familiar with Rosneft said it would be open to selling CEFC a stake in its retail business, which includes almost 3,000 filling stations, around 150 oil storage complexes and over 1,000 gasoline tankers.

Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China's biggest oil supplier, and Rosneft is by far Russia's biggest and most influential oil company, with strong ties to the Kremlin.

Having access to Rosneft's reserves and refining capacity would boost CEFC's ambitions to become a major international energy merchant and rival to traders like Glencore.

CEFC, which has a rare contract to store part of China's strategic oil reserve, has expanded aggressively, hiring officials from state-owned energy firms and acquiring a series of overseas assets since 2015.

The Russian government, through holding company Rosneftegaz, owns 50 percent of Rosneft, after it sold a 19.5 percent stake to Glencore and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) for more than 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) in December. It would need to issue a special government decree if it were to lower its holding in Rosneft below 50 percent.

BP owns 19.75 percent of Rosneft.

Asked to comment on the stake acquisition talks, a CEFC spokesman said the two firms signed a cooperation agreement on Aug. 2, when Sechin visited CEFC's headquarters in Shanghai. That deal was a broad cooperation on everything from oil and gas exploration to financial services, according to CEFC's website.

The spokesman did not comment on whether those discussions involved a stake purchase.

A Rosneft spokesman said the company saw China as a strategic partner and was cooperating with a wide range of Chinese companies, including CEFC.

""We consider the Chinese market as the most promising and actively developing. The company will increase its cooperation with Chinese partners in all business areas and make public statements accordingly as joint projects are developing,"" the company said in an email.

""Rosneft does not hold its shares and, therefore, does not sell its shares.""

Reuters could not immediately reach Rosneftegaz for comment. Glencore, QIA and BP declined to comment.

CHINA RISING

CEFC would be the first privately held Chinese firm to invest in a major oil giant. Usually, Beijing would tap China's three big state-owned oil players for strategic investments.

With ambitions to become China's next oil giant, CEFC paid nearly $900 million for a 4 percent stake in an onshore field majority-owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), and has agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in KMGI, a unit of Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz, and a 20 percent stake in New York-based financial services firm Cowen Group Inc.

The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine: Rosneft, whose CEO is seen as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is the only company sanctioned by both.

The sanctions will be a key concern for CEFC before any further serious decision, and could pose financing challenges, said one senior Chinese source familiar with the discussions.

""The company is now engaging lawyers to evaluate thoroughly the legal hurdles sanctions may bring about,"" the person said, adding it was too soon to discuss valuations.

CEFC and Rosneft have over the past 3-4 years discussed various cooperation opportunities from upstream investment in Russian oilfields to oil trade, but only recently did Rosneft initiate the idea of a stake investment, said another senior Chinese source briefed on the matter.

CEFC has assigned a task force of around 40 people to work on the investment, a third person said.

The two companies could announce a deal as soon as early next month, when senior Russian officials are expected to visit Beijing, that person added."

The grandfather and the pioneer in the family, Captain Jai Dev Bhasin, was among the first seven pilots in the country to become a commander in 1954. When his future daughter-in-law Nivedita Jain joined his company, Indian Airlines, she was the third woman to do so. Today, she and her husband Captain Rohit Bhasin are proud parents of two young commanders, Rohan and Niharika Bhasin.

""Flying fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Maybe when I was as young as six or seven,"" recalls the matriarch, Nivedita Jain, 54.

Her face lights up recounting the most important day of her life as if it were yesterday. ""I was at a friend's birthday party when my father came running with an appointment letter for me from Indian Airlines. The day is etched in my memory. It was June 29, 1984,"" she says. She was just 20 when she received the letter and in the next 11 years, went on to achieve her most cherished career milestones. At 26, already a mother of a one-year-old, she received her command on a Boeing 737, becoming the youngest woman captain of a jet plane in the world. Seven years later when she became a commander on Airbus 300, one of the bigger air craft then in the world and also the first-ever wide-body aircraft, it would be the culmination of her dreams.

She also became a trendsetter when she co-piloted the world's first ever all-woman crew flight with a Fokker Friendship aircraft on the Calcutta-Silchar route in 1985.

Her feats set her apart and her children say they were in awe of her from their early days.

""As a a child I used to keep looking at her while she was getting ready for work and I really wanted to dress up like that one day,"" says Niharika, 26, who has been flying with IndiGo for over four years and received her command on the Airbus A320 recently. Not having their parents around all the time during their childhood did not bother the siblings as it was the only normal they knew. That has changed since they started flying.

""I realise now how difficult it would have been to coordinate flying and bringing up two children. They made it seem so smooth, but in all honesty it's not,"" Niharika says.

Nivedita Bhasin was the first pilot in her company to become a mother and it was in the years following her first child that the company instituted a policy on maternity leave. The mother admits that there were times she thought of quitting the profession, especially when her children were nearing adolescence, but she was not ready to give up on a dream she had struggled to achieve. That dream and passion were passed on to the offspring, who say that the thought of pursuing any other career never crossed their minds.

"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants — devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.“Prices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,” stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."

"Centre plans to sell generic medicines at fuel stations, Health News, ET HealthWorld","(Image used for representation only)

NEW DELHI: The government is working on opening ' Jan Aushadhi ' (generic medicines) stores at petrol pumps belonging to state-run fuel retailers across the country with a view to make cheap drugs accessible to masses, Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Wednesday.""Oil marketing companies are bringing an ecosystem of non-fuel retail business at petrol pumps through tieups. The Jan Aushadhi stores under the department of pharmaceuticals in the chemicals & fertilizers ministry will also be opened at the outlets in the future,"" Pradhan said after the fuel retailers inked MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Ltd for selling energy-efficient appliances and LED bulbs from petrol pumps.But shortage of qualified pharmacists have emerged as a problem. Under law, drug stores need to have qualified pharmacists. While most of the private drug stores list such pharmacists, they are seldom present. ""As government entity, we can't do that,"" a person familiar with inter-government discussions told TOI. But the officials were hopeful of finding a way and said it will also open job opportunities.EESL is a company promoted by state-run power utilities. It is spearheading the government's flagship 'Ujala' scheme to replace all incandescent and CFL bulbs in the country with LED lamps by 2019.Pradhan said the IT ministry's 'Common Service Centre' concept is also being explored to offer government services such as issuing PAN and E-Aadhaar cards, utility bill payments, banking solutions and agriservices at the pumps.Power, coal and renewable energy minister Piyush Goyal said the MoU was an example of how the Narendra Modi government worked as a single unit.Under the tie-up with IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, EESL will leverage the network of their 55,000 petrol pumps, which have a daily footfall of 3.5 crore, to sell LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances.""It is worth noting that two important ministries have come together to realise the Prime Minister's vision of every citizen having access to energy efficient appliances. The marketing network of the three oil marketing companies is unparalleled and this tie-up will only accelerate and scale up the distribution of energy efficient appliances across the length and breadth of the country,"" he said.EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by the oil marketing companies, barring manpower and space. EESL will pay 10% to the outlets on sale. The consumer can purchase high-quality 9W LED bulbs for Rs 70, 20W LED tubelight for Rs 220 and five-star rated ceiling fan for Rs 1,200."

Up these sex moves using a blindfold,"We have to thank Christian Grey and his fifty shades of kink for elevating the blindfold to the lofty position of being the sexiest prop ever! Are you still not convinced about just how hot your sex session could get with the use of a blindfold? Get that silky garment of cloth in the bedroom and you won't see these sex positions in the same light anymore!

Tease time: Give him a preview of what is to come (no pun intended). Have him tie the blindfold around your eyes and then leave you alone. Well, not completely. You go to town blinded and he watches you. Masturbating blindfolded will help you let go of whatever inhibitions you may have and for him, it is a sight he won't get enough of. Want to take this up a notch further? Dare him to ONLY watch you for five minutes and if he loses (he will!), you get to have your way with him for the night.



Blind lap dance: For him, that is. Let him get a glimpse of you in your sexy wear before you blindfold him. Turn your seductress mode on and tease him for a while before you take control of his hands and move them just the way you want it, where you want it. All the while moving your hips in an eight-figure motion as you bounce and dance away on his lap. The high of being completely in control, coupled with the ecstatic expressions his face is bound to show, guarantee an orgasm you won't forget!



Go deep: Sex up the sitting cowgirl position by blindfolding each other. And then, let your other senses kick into action. Heavy breathing, deep moans, pelvic squeezes, tracing sweet-nothings with your tongue—this intimate position gets hotter since you will be relying completely on being able to feel his thrust and rhythm to stay in sync. Now that's what we mean by 'going deep'."
"Magnetic resonance imaging: Now, multicolour MRIs to improve disease detection, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Washington: Scientists have developed a new method to make magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) multicolour to improve disease detection.

Current MRI techniques rely on a single contrast agent injected into a patient's veins to vivify images.

The new method uses two agents at once, which could allow doctors to map multiple characteristics of a patient's internal organs in a single MRI.

""The method we developed enables, for the first time, the simultaneous detection of two different MRI contrast agents,"" said Chris Flask, associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in the US.

Two contrast agents could include one specifically targeting diseased tissue, and one designed to show healthy tissue, for example.

The new method would enable immediate comparisons of how each agent distributes in the same patient.

""This multi-agent detection capability has the potential to transform molecular imaging, as it provides a critical translational pathway for studies in patients,"" said Flask.

""It also provides a unique imaging platform to rigorously study molecular therapies,"" he said.

Therapies could include those targeting biomarkers or other detectable molecules associated with diseases.

Two contrast agents, gadolinium and manganese, can be detected and independently quantified during MRIs, researchers said.

The results provide ""an adaptable, quantitative imaging framework to assess two MRI contrast agents simultaneously for a wide variety of imaging applications,"" they said.

The researchers have begun to investigate widespread practical applications for the new MRI approach.

""We validated our new methodology, opening the possibility for numerous follow-on application studies in cancer, genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes,"" Flask added.

The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports"

The Game of Thrones fever is so high that the fantasy drama has fans all around the world. So much that it has also become the most pirated show, but even that has not stopped the show from continuing to put people into frenzy.

After the recent episodes were leaked from the currently being aired seventh season and four people from Mumbai were arrested in the same regard, there comes another twist. The leak has been traced to the Prime Focus Technologies’ office in Bengaluru. The company is involved in the digital content of the series for Hotstar.

HBO Twitter

Another episode, the sixth one, has also been leaked, and what’s even more shocking is that it was “by mistake” aired on HBO Spain for one hour. Yes, that happened, and we are wondering what’s going wrong, too. The channel wanted to air episode 6, but by mistake, it aired the seventh one entirely (71-minute long episode.)

Fans shared the video clips speculating how the episode must have leaked. Reportedly, one of the Instagram users live-streamed the entire episode.

There are major spoilers ahead. Warning you, again.

"NPPA: Cap prices of drugs & medical appliances also: Doctors' body, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: After the government fixed a price range for knee implants, a national body of medics working to promote ethical healthcare has demanded that a cap should be put on the cost of drugs and other medical appliances also.

Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare (ADEH) has submitted a detailed document regarding the prices of various types of implants and medicines to the chairman of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA).

After cardiac stents, the government yesterday fixed a price range for knee implants from Rs 54,000 to Rs 1.14 lakh, nearly 70 per cent lower than most surgeries currently cost.

Time has come now that the price of medicines and other medical appliances should be streamlined on the pattern of coronary stents and orthopaedic implants, ADEH said in a statement.

""We have learnt that the government formed a committee to review the medicine prices which has recommended substantial reduction in prices of medicines but the government is not making it public.

""We demand that this report should be made public immediately. The government should formulate a trade policy for the pharmaceutical products,"" it said."
"After The Failure Of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', Distributors Now Want SRK To Refund Money","With back to back losses and big releases flopping one after the other, Hindi Film industry is indeed going through a rough patch.

Massive flops include films like Salman’s Tubelight, Ranbir Kapoor, and Katrina Kaif’s Jagga Jasoos and now, Imtiaz Ali’s Jab Harry Met Sejal has joined the list. The film that was one of the most anticipated films of the year ended up proving to be one big disaster. Apart from the producers, NH Studioz too has suffered huge losses.

The studios had acquired the rights of Tubelight for Rs. 132 crores and Jab Harry Met Sejal for Rs. 80 crores and now that both the films have proved to be such disasters, the intensity of the losses are huge.

While Salman had set a great example by returning some amount to the distributors, a Bollywoodhungama report claims that the distributors have sent an SOS message to Shah Rukh Khan, and have asked them to follow the suit.

Viral Bhayani

According to the reports, they are now expecting a refund for the backbreaking losses since Shah Rukh Khan had made good profits from the pre-sale of All India Rights to NH Studioz, satellite, music, and digital rights.

Pinterest

Just to jog your memory a little, SRK had distributors of his 2015 film Dilwale when they had incurred losses and he had refunded close to Rs. 25 crores to cover up 50% losses to distributors of Dilwale.

And this wasn’t the first time SRK did so because, in 2001 and 2005, Shah Rukh Khan had refunded the individual distributors of his films Asoka (Eros) and Paheli (UTV) after they failed to perform at the box-office.

While no actor or producer is bounded to return money to distributors, our actors are definitely setting a great example.

"India to phase out 5,500 Megawatt of coal-fired power plants, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India has identified 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of inefficient coal-fired power plants to be retired, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told lawmakers on Thursday, as the country looks to cut emissions and make better use of its coal reserves.

The Central Electrical Authority (CEA) has identified coal-fired plants which are more than 25 years old for retirement in a phased manner on the basis of their ""inefficiency and un-economic operation,"" Goyal said. He did not provide details on the timeframe over which they would be phased out.

Around 78 percent of generated power in India still comes from coal-fired plants, making it one of the biggest users in the world of the dirty and cheap fuel.

Coal-fired plants account for about 195 GW of India's 330 GW of installed power capacity, data on the CEA's website shows.

India, which is also undergoing a programme to retrofit several coal-fired plants to reduce emissions, has retired about 4 GW of coal-fired power plants over the last two years.

However, state-run power utility NTPC Ltd plans to invest $10 billion in new coal-fired power stations over the next five years despite the electricity regulator's assessment that thermal plants now under construction will be able to meet demand until 2027, Reuters reported this month."

"Bengaluru's Bellandur Lake Spills Toxic Foam Yet Again, With Hopes Of Clean Revival Fading Away","Today, Bengaluru's highly polluted Bellandur lake once again spilled toxic foam after heavy overnight rain.

Bellandur lake is the largest of the 262 lakes and tanks in Bengaluru, and it has spilled toxic foam many times in the recent past and on several occasions the toxic foam also caught fire.

bccl

The sorry state of the lake forced the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to take the matter suo motto.

On April 19, the NGT directed immediate and complete shutdown of 76 polluting industries around the lake after a mound of garbage was set on fire in February this year leading to massive pollution in the area.

The green court expressed displeasure over the steps taken by the different state government agencies for the revival of the Bellandur lake and asked the Karnataka Government to clean the lake within a month.

bccl

The NGT also raised questions as to why an action was not taken to block the entry of sewerage water despite repeated reminders from the State Pollution Control Board.

It further directed the state government to set up a committee headed by the Urban Development Department (UDD) to monitor the rejuvenation of the Bellandur lake.

On May 18, the NGT directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to physically inspect the industries around Bellandur lake whether they are shut and not just issue closure notices.

The never ending quest for Independence,"As India celebrated the 70th anniversary of Independence from foreign rule, a friend sent me a series of photographs taken in the flood-ravaged areas in the north east.

The pictures showed people – men, women and children – standing of the roofs of submerged houses, or standing waist-deep in floodwater. All the pictures had one thing in common: the people in them were, one and all, saluting the tricolour that rose, triumphantly, above the deluge.

Taken together, the pictures were an inspiring testimony to the spirit of Independence.

However, on the same day, the TOI carried a news report about Choudipur, a tiny village in UP, whose residents refused to join in the nationwide celebrations for Independence Day.

The reason? Seventy years after the country gained freedom, no development whatsoever has reached them.

The village is mired in abject poverty, cut off from the rest of the country as there are no roads worth the name to get to it. There is no electricity, and only four households in the village have indoor toilets. The great majority of the villagers have no option but to defecate in the open.

Places like Choudipur are obviously exceptions to the general progress that the country in its entirety has made since it gained freedom.

Longevity has significantly increased, both for men and women. Infant mortality has been greatly reduced. Diseases such as polio have been largely eradicated. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of the abyss of extreme poverty.

But places like Choudipur serve to remind us that though we have indeed travelled a long way since our historic ‘midnight tryst with destiny’, we still have a long way to go.

According to varying estimates, anything between 25 per cent and 34 per cent of the country’s population still exists below the officially accepted poverty line.

Brutal oppression of dalits and other marginalised sections of society remains a national stigma, as do the crimes of violence against women which are an everyday occurrence.

Joblessness continues to grow, and not just among the uneducated or unskilled. According to a recent report, one out of every two MBAs is unemployed.

All this is not to downplay the great progress that the country has made in 70 years.

But while acknowledging and taking justifiable pride in the country’s many achievements – as the flood-affected people in the photographs sent to me were shown to be doing – we should also recognise the grim realities as represented by places like Choudipur, and the uncounted thousands of others like it.

Such recognition is necessary because it serves to remind us that Independence – social, economic and political – is not a destination, but a journey. It is a road we must continue to travel, not with cynicism or despair, but with determination and hope.

That’s the best salute that we can offer the tricolour of freedom."
"PM Modi says the world will study India's GST experiment one day, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime for bolstering the country's economic progress, and expressed the belief that one day the world would definitely study ""India's GST experiment"".He said the pace at which the transition from the old tax regime to the GST has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.""And some day, the pundits of economics, management and technology will certainly undertake researches and write about India's GST experiment as a model for the world,"" Modi said during his radio address ' Mann Ki Baat ' which is broadcast every last Sunday of the month.""It will become a case study for universities across the world.

"No Place For Hate: Tech CEOs Satya Nadella, Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook Support Diversity & Unity","Days after violence at a white-extremist rally in Virginia resulted in three pro-diversity protesters being killed, leaders in the tech community have come out against racial bias, bigotry, and violence.

Reuters

Indian-origin Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella condemned the violence, saying it has no place in our society. In a letter to Microsoft employees he wrote, “Microsoft values diversity, and asks employees to empathise with the hurt happening around us.”

“There is no place in our society for the bias, bigotry and senseless violence we witnessed this weekend in Virginia provoked by white nationalists. It is an especially important time to continue to be connected with people, and listen and learn from each other's experiences.”

Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook also shot off an email to his staff, clearly stating his stand. “I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights,” Cook said in an email to his staff.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted on the social media platform saying, “There is no place for hate in our community. That's why we've always taken down any post that promotes or celebrates hate crimes or acts of terrorism -- including what happened in Charlottesville.”

“With the potential for more rallies, we're watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm. We won't always be perfect, but you have my commitment that we'll keep working to make Facebook a place where everyone can feel safe,” he wrote.

With Celery Seed Water (Ajwain Ka Pani) lose up to 6 kgs in 2 weeks!,"All of us know that salads, fibre-rich diet, regular exercise and good sleep is the easiest way to stay fit and healthy for longer than one can imagine, but the real problem comes when one has to manage all of these simultaneously.

Well, for me at least it was. From lemon-honey warm water to coriander and jeera water I tried everything. But due to my over-stressed and unscheduled life, nothing appeared to workout.

So, while I was done with people sharing their weight loss (motivational) stories and their ‘before and after pictures’, I came across this post by a girl, ‘who unlike others actually shared her secret to weight loss!!!’

Yeah, and she was just as normal as you and me and face regular problems like us, for example: “she too didn’t want to give up food” and “go and workout in gym”; in short, do anything humanly laborious to lose weight.

And so, I tried her way and surprisingly have been losing both inches and kgs; although, she lose up to 5 kgs in 15 days.



She explains that mostly people gather stubborn fat around their abdominal area, which could be either due to bloating or poor gut health and when that is treated, things start working out in your way.

She suggested to deal with both the problems and losing weight simultaneously with Celery Seeds Water or Ajwain Water, which is effective when taken empty-stomach; early morning is the best time for it.

All you’ve got to do is:

Soak a tablespoon of Celery Seeds (Ajwain) overnight and next morning boil the entire content. Filter the seeds out and drink the celery seeds water on empty-stomach and avoid eating anything until an hour.

This solution would treat you digestion, cure bloating and gut health and all along burn steep fat around your abdomen.

Note: You can also drink this one-hour before every meal that you take throughout the day, for even faster and better results!

"GST impact: Over 25% of trucks idle amid drop in interstate movement, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Wholesale and distribution businesses in particular are hesitant to despatch untaxed cargo under the GST regime.

More than a fourth of India’s 6 million-strong truck pool is said to be idle after the goods and services tax ( GST ) came into force on July 1 amid a drop in interstate movement of untaxed and underreported cargo, leading to a fall in retail freight charges.That’s having a knock-on effect on the transport and truck-making businesses, at least in the short term, experts said.Interstate retail freight rates are down 40-50%, the sharpest decline in over three decades, said SP Singh, senior fellow at the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training ( IFTRT ).Such steep declines in freight rates were seen in 1984, 1988, 2008 and just after the 2016 demonetisation , say transporters To be sure, transport operators are reporting logistic efficiency gains as those trucks that are running are reaching destinations quicker with border check posts having been scrapped.India’s 6 million trucks range from 5 tonnes to 49 tonnes. Out of the total, 1.3 million have national permits and 1.2 million have permits for their home state and neighbouring states, with 40-45% of them not running currently.Out of the remaining 3.5 million trucks that have permits for their home states, a fourth are idle, added Singh However, in the long run, the increased economic activity that’s expected to result from GST, will mean greater demand for trucks, raising the prospect of a big boost for the commercial vehicle market.But for now, wholesale and distribution businesses in particular are hesitant to despatch untaxed cargo under the GST regime.Untaxed invoices dodging the tax authorities have virtually disappeared from freight markets, except for a few interstate destinations in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, parts of Maharashtra and the North-East, said Singh of IFTRT.That’s led to a postponement of new truck purchases and a rise in defaults on hire purchase dues.Non-banking finance companies may hold back on lending, pushing up interest rates. The Indian medium and heavy truck segment fell 32% in the June quarter to 48,493 units due to significant pre-buying in the preceding quarter and delayed purchases due to uncertainty on GST.Long-haul transporters renew their fleet every five-six years, with the older trucks going to the secondary market. But transporters have stopped selling older vehicles, as there is no clarity over GST on secondhand trucks, said Naveen Gupta, secretary general, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).He’s sought government support for truckers who can’t make loan and insurance payments on account of lower earnings.The worst hit are small fleet operators and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which account for almost 40% of the load carried in the country, according to a senior executive at a leading truck maker.Many operated outside the purview of taxes and it will take a few months before the numbers get back to former levels as they become familiar with the GST regime. However, Jasjit Sethi, CEO of TCI Supply Chain Solutions, one of India’s largest transporters, said July has always been a slow month.He expects a hockey stick kind of growth in the next quarter as transporters get more comfortable with GST. “The idle capacity in our opinion is at about 10-15%, which is largely seasonal in nature with a little bit of impact from the GST announcement,” Sethi said.“The movement is sluggish right now, but with the onset of festive season, we are expecting stronger movement of goods and the freight rates to firm up.”Another truck company executive said his company had started seeing a 10-15% increased efficiency in goods movement, which effectively means the existing fleet can do that much more business. Vinod Aggarwal, MD and CEO at VE Commercial Vehicles , expects demand to be slow in the coming two months before things normalise in the GST ecosystem.“There are hiccups expected in the next one or two months,” he said. “Starting September, the demand may pick up. Customers are in wait-and-watch mode. One after the other disruptions have taken place. Government has to look at ways of boosting private investment and that combined with correction of interest rates will help drive demand fundamentally.”When buying resumes, transporters will seek quality.“With faster turnaround time and higher efficiencies, people will be more inclined to replace the older legacy trucks with modern trucks, which is expected to gain a larger pie of the market and that in turn will aid growth in commercial vehicle market,"" said TCI’s Sethi."
"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of “cheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."
"MP govt not in favour of bringing petroleum products under GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Indore: The Madhya Pradesh government here today made it clear that it can not give consent to the GST Council to bring the petroleum products under the purview of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

""The total commercial revenue that we get from petroleum products is about 35 per cent of the total tax (commercial) that government collects.

""Therefore, it is difficult for us to give consent to the GST Council for bringing petroleum products under the purview of GST as we need funds for running the government, development and to fulfill our social obligations,"" finance minister Jayant Mallaiya told reporters.

However, the minister, who admitted that the rate of tax (VAT and entry tax) on petroleum products in the state is on the higher side also gave a justification for it.

""States like Gujarat and Maharashtra get sufficient tax revenue from industrial production, but it was not the case with Madhya Pradesh as industrial activities are less here. Therefore, for earning enough funds (tax revenue) we have to levy tax on petroleum products,"" Mallaiya said.

The minister said in 2016-17, a total of Rs 29,500 crore commercial tax was collected in the state which means an increase of 14.5 per cent per year.

Mallaiya said he was satisfied with the implementation of GST in the state and the GST Council on the basis of state's feedback is continuously reforming it.

""Madhya Pradesh will get lot of benefit with this new tax regime because it is located centrally. It will also result in enhancement of business activities especially stocking and transportation of goods,"" he said.

Answering a question he said only those who don't want to do their business in a fair manner are not happy with decisions like GST and demonetisation.

On opposition's charge that the state government is burdening people by borrowing money continuously, the minister said the government will not have any problem in taking loans for developmental and schemes meant for fulfilling social obligations.

Besides, the growth rate of the state is much higher under BJP regime than that of Congress."

"Achieving high end of 6.75-7.5 per cent GDP growth difficult: Economic Survey, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Achieving the high end of the 6.75-7.5 per cent growth projected previously will be difficult due to appreciation of rupee, farm loan waivers and transitionary challenges from implementing GST, the Economic Survey said today.

For the first time today, the government presented a second or a mid-year economic survey for the year 2017-18 highlighting the new factors that the economy faces since the last such exercise in February.

It also said that the scope for monetary easing was considerable and this, coupled with reform to address the twin balance sheet challenge, will help the economy achieve its full potential quicker.

""Cyclical conditions suggest that the policy rate should actually be below... the neutral rate. The conclusion is inescapable that the scope for monetary easing is considerable,"" he said.

The Economic Survey said that a number of indicators-- GDP, IIP, credit, investment and capacity utilisation, point to a deceleration in real activity since first quarter of 2016-17 and a further deceleration since the third quarter.

The first volume of the Survey in February had predicted the range of GDP growth of between 6.75-7.5 per cent, factoring in more buoyant exports, a post-demonetisation catch-up in consumption and a relaxation in monetary conditions consequent upon demonetisation.

Since then all the new factors-- real exchange rate appreciation, farm loan waivers, increasing stress to balance sheet in power, telecom, agricultural stress and transitional challenges from implementing the GST -- impart a deflationary bias to activity, the Survey said.

Since February 2017, the rupee has appreciated by about 1.5 per cent.

It said the government and the RBI have taken ""prominent steps"" to address the twin balance sheet challenge which has boosted market confidence in the short run. Also, the removal of checkposts and easing of transport constraints after Goods and Service Tax (GST) implementation can provide some short- term fillip to economic activity.

The Survey said that the balance of risk to achieving the 6.75-7.5 per cent growth has shifted to the downside.

""The balance of probabilities has changed accordingly, with outcomes closer to the upper end having much less weight tha previously,"" it added."
Guard up: New Delhi must prepare for a long term Chinese strategy of containment,"With the Doklam standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at the India-China-Bhutan trijunction continuing, there are signs that the entire Line of Actual Control (LAC) will witness turbulent times ahead. On Tuesday Indian and Chinese troops pelted stones at each other at Ladakh after Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into Indian territory. This comes after incursions by the Chinese side into a mutually agreed demilitarised zone at Barahoti, Uttarakhand, late last month. Experts believe that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army could be trying to occupy a border territory similar to Doklam as a face saver. With an important party congress of the Chinese Communist Party coming up later in the year, the ruling dispensation in Beijing needs to show it has prevailed over New Delhi.

This means that India has to be extra vigilant against Chinese designs, both at the LAC and elsewhere. Although full-scale armed conflict still remains unlikely, Beijing won’t hold back in unleashing psychological warfare and cyber bullying against New Delhi. The strident Chinese rhetoric on Doklam and incursions in other areas seem to be part of this strategy, which aims to defeat opponents without firing a bullet. New Delhi needs to be aware of this strategy of containing it – whose overall objective can only be setting up a unipolar Asia where everyone is forced to kowtow to Chinese demands – and come up with its own counter-measures. These must include shoring up its cyber defences.

In this context, the decision by the US to elevate its strategic consultations with India through a new 2-by-2 ministerial dialogue is welcome. Similarly, India is ramping up multi-sectoral engagement with Asean nations, many of whom have disputes with China. New Delhi should not hesitate to work with Tokyo, Djakarta, Hanoi, Taipei and other like-minded Asian capitals.

Finally, China’s biggest strategic vulnerability is its trade surplus with most nations aided by unfair import barriers imposed by Beijing, of which India has certainly been a victim. With Chinese-made products and components flooding the Indian market there are concerns regarding security and data leaks. New Delhi has done well to start a review of imports of Chinese IT products and electronics which could become tools for hacking and procuring sensitive information. Beijing surely has no moral ground to complain, and if it starts a trade war it will be on the losing side."

"UAE's Topaz Energy and Marine eyes expansion, better growth in 2018, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Rania El Gamal

DUBAI: Topaz Energy and Marine expects to expand in Kazakhstan and the Middle East as the Dubai-based oil services company projects better growth for the industry next year with oil prices stabilising around $50 a barrel, its chief executive said.

A sharp drop in crude prices since mid-2014 has forced oil producing and service firms to re-evaluate projects worth billions of dollars and cut costs. Companies are looking at forming alliances to reduce risk.

""The industry is becoming smarter ... We are in most offshore fields today, in an environment where $50 Brent is actually giving positive cash flow,"" Chief Executive Rene Kofod-Olsen said in an interview on Thursday.

""We believe that we are in a trough - we will enter an environment in which investments will start flowing ... While 2017 is a tough year, 2018 is probably going to be a significantly better year for the oil and gas service industry in general than the last two years have been.""

The company reported on Thursday a net loss of $13.4 million for the first half of this year, compared to a year-earlier profit of $800,000. Revenue fell 23 percent to $115.6 million.

Topaz, a unit of Oman's Renaissance Services, operates in the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and West Africa. In the Gulf, it works with state oil giants such as Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.

""I don't believe that we have enough market share in Saudi Arabia - we can grow market share there. I believe that we should grow market share in the United Arab Emirates, and would like to participate in the newer exploration areas. Certainly it is something that we look at,"" Kofod-Olsen said.

Topaz has been working at Kazakhstan's Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields. The Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian Sea is set to ramp up output further in 2017 and more next year.

""We have historically been servicing the Kashagan field. Next year we believe they will have the next phase ... We will hopefully be considered for that as well.""

The company issued $375 million of five-year bonds at a yield of 9.125 percent in July. Kofod-Olsen said the company did not plan to refinance its existing bonds next year ""but if the whole world improves and so on, we could definitely refinance in two to three years for sure"".

Topaz does not have any imminent plans for an initial public offer of shares. It planned a London listing in 2011 but did not go through with the offer because of valuation concerns and regional unrest.

""We are seeking to run the company as close to a public company as possible, also because we have debt in the capital market,"" said Kofod-Olsen.

""Right now we don't have an imminent plan for doing an IPO but it is something we are following, of course."""

"GST: GST Council flooded with requests to slash tax rates on various commodities, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","The requests also include cutting 12 per cent tax on agriculture implements to nil or maximum 5 per cent, on raw granite to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite finished to 12 per cent from 28 per cent.

New Delhi: From helmets to granite slabs, hybrid cars to namkeen, the GST Council is flooded with requests for tweaking tax rates on a variety of commodities.

The Council, the highest policy making body on Goods and Services Tax (GST), has received requests for changes in tax rates on as many as 133 different products from an array of stakeholders, official sources said.

India moved to a GST regime on July 1 after the Council fixed over 1,200 products in four tax slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent.

However, some are not happy with the brackets and have sought changes, sources said.

These include slashing GST on IT products to 12 per cent from 18 per cent as it provides huge employment to skilled persons. On IT hardware, a tax cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent has been sought.

GST on helmets has been demanded from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, on textiles to nil from 5 per cent, on tractors to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite slabs to 18 per cent from 28 per cent currently.

Namkeen, bhujias and potato chips should attract 5 per cent tax and not 12 per cent as per a demand put before the Council.

Tax cuts have also been sought on sweetmeats, kulfi, wet dates, Isabgol, and a variety of sugar confectioneries like peanut chikki.

Moreover, a request has been made for cut in tax on macaroni/ pasta/noodles to 5 per cent from 18 per cent as vermicelli is taxed at 5 per cent and there should be uniform tax on all products manufactured through the same set of machines and equipment.



A demand has been made to cut tax rate on packaged drinking water sold in small pouches and refill cans with 20 litre capacity to nil from present 18 per cent as GST implementation has seen a sudden rise in their prices.

Also, tax on hair pin, LPG stoves, umbrella, writing instruments, wet grinders, weighing machines compressors, textile machinery parts, chewing tobacco, multi-function printers and handmade carpets comes under the reduction category.

GST on chutney power has been sought at 12 per cent from 18 per cent and on pickle to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.

On motor cycles with engine capacity of more than 350 cc and up to 500 cc, the 3 per cent cess on top of 28 per cent tax rate has been sought to be removed as such vehicles are used for commuting. Also, only Royal Enfield makes vehicles of 350 cc and above and fulfils the ambition of Make in India.

A demand has been made to reduce cess on hybrid cars to 3 per cent from 15 per cent currently. The cess is levied on top of the total tax rate of 28 per cent. The reason behind the demand is that these cars are environment-friendly and are required to be encouraged.

GST on sanitary pads has been sought to be nil from 12 per cent.

Sources said GST Council refers some of the tax change requests to the fitment committee to see if there is any merit in the demands and upon recommendation of the committee takes up for approval any changes.



GST on dried fish has been sought to be cut to nil from 5 per cent, on plastic scrap to nil from 18 per cent, on fishing nets to 5 per cent from 12 per cent, on furniture to 12-18 per cent from current 28 per cent.

The requests also include cutting 12 per cent tax on agriculture implements to nil or maximum 5 per cent, on raw granite to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite finished to 12 per cent from 28 per cent.

A nil duty has been sought for fly-ash and fly-ash bricks from current 18 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively to popularise the use of the otherwise environmental pollutant.

To help cut reliance on imported oil, duty on bio-diesel or bio fuel extracted from non-edible oilseeds has been sought to be cut to nil or 5 per cent from current 18 per cent."
"GMR finds buyer for its barge-mounted power plant for $ 63 million, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","The company said in a press release on Wednesday that it will be the designated airport operator in the consortium for this project.

Hyderabad: The GMR Group, which owns a 220 MW gas based power plant in Andhra Pradesh's Kakinada, will sell its barge-mounted power plant to a buyer for USD 63 million.

According to a regulatory filing, the infrastructure major has said that GMR Energy Ltd (GEL) will enter into a definitive agreement with the buyer soon.

The filing, however, did not reveal the buyer's name.

""GEL has entered into a memorandum of undertaking with an external party for sale of its 220 mw gas based power plant for a consideration of USD 6.3 crore and is in the process of entering into a definitive agreement and conclude the sale,"" the filing said.

According to GMR, the plant is operational since November 2001 and redeployed at Kakinada since April 2010.

Redefining party building: Amit Shah is leading BJP with courage of conviction,"On the evening of Narendra Modi’s swearing in as prime minister, Amit Shah was in the audience sitting next to a leader of a BJP ally. The alliance party leader informally enquired about Amit Shah’s chances of becoming party chief and said it would be a welcome development. Amit Shah politely remarked, tongue in cheek, that the latter’s joy may be short lived as in the event of his taking over, BJP may not part with so many seats. The ally leader was stumped by his candour.

Political scientist Rajni Kothari had famously defined what he termed the Congress system of party building. Pointing out the strength of Congress in the late seventies he rightly observed, “Congress is still, and is likely to be for a long time, the most organised political party in the country, with a nationwide following and considerable depth in the localities.” Ironically, today’s Congress seems to have squandered all that it had earned. And it is BJP that has emerged as the most organised party with pan-India following and presence in localities.

In fact, that rightly sums up the work of BJP chief Amit Shah. He has, through unrelenting efforts, converted the ‘nationwide following’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi into ‘considerable depth in the localities’. For any objective political analyst, Shah’s work presents a case study of party building.

When Shah took over in August 2014, BJP was in power in just a handful of states. Today, it has its own chief ministers in 13 states and is a partner in another five states. Its membership has increased from three crores to 11 crores. It has the largest number of MLAs and MPs as well. Even in Rajya Sabha, BJP is now the top party. To have achieved this in a span of barely three years is unparalleled and historic.

Through his presidency, Shah has ensured that party cadre remain engaged in one meaningful activity after the other. In the past two years BJP has conducted thousands of training programmes involving over ten lakh party workers. Many of these trained human resources are now engaged in grassroots party work as vistaraks, with their eyes set on party consolidation at the booth level. Over 4000 workers, dedicating six months to a year away from the cosy comforts of their homes, are engaged in this all over the country.

Shah believes in setting an example through his own untiring efforts. During the last few months, he has spent over 60 days undertaking systematic organisational tours to states across the country. On these tours he interacts with all functionaries, seeks feedback from booth level workers, meets all elected representatives, breaks bread with artists and writers, listens to social media enthusiasts and engages in question-answer sessions, thereby establishing a powerful connect.

Shah richly deserves credit for institutionalising party functioning. He has established an integrated chain of party meetings. Its national executive meets every quarter followed by state, district and taluka executives, ensuring a seamless flow of message from the top and feedback from the ground. Also, from Policy Research to Party Literature and Good Governance to Party Programmes, he has created 19 party departments with a clear functional mandate.

Besides, he is out to change the very culture of party mobilisation. He wants party workers to be sensitive to the agonies of the underprivileged and aspirations of all. In order to further sensitise party workers, he has also asked party units to undertake some ten projects, three of which have a clear social content.

What is remarkable is his clear vision. He understands very well the importance of groundswell of goodwill, public trust and support earned by Modi. He knows these are the best of times to build upon this capital. Setting up well equipped party offices at every district with a library and e-library, containing rich collection of books, is a key item on his agenda.

Felicitating Shah on his Rajya Sabha election, Modi pointed out that to galvanise party organisation when the party is in power is extremely difficult. But difficulties have never deterred Shah. In his view “electoral success is important, but remember we are not an election winning machine. We are a party with a mission, a mission of reconstructing a great India.”"

"OPINION: Light ahead, but at the end of a tunnel: Economic Survey is sanguine and cautious, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Volume II of the Economic Survey holds out bright light at the end of a pretty dark tunnel: medium-term prospects are bright, but short-term ones are dim. Growth would be lower than 7.5% in the current fiscal, inflation would stay below 4%, state governments would find it difficult to spend on capital formation after using up their fiscal space to take on the debt of bankrupt power utilities and distressed farmers.The Centre is doing its best to prop up the flagging investment ratio, but is constrained to meet its fiscal deficit target in a year of low nominal GDP growth and promised spending on higher civil service pay. To help things along, the RBI must slash its policy rates aggressively and the ongoing process of tackling the twin balance-sheet (TBS) problem must continue apace. And the government must boost farm incomes by removing constraints on farm prices such as export bans,stocking limits and marketing restrictions.The Survey’s diagnosis of the economy’s ills and its prescriptions are unlikely to blind observers of the economy with any dazzling originality. That does not mean they are not sound, although some qualifications apply. Is the goods and services tax ( GST ) guaranteed to keep prices in check? Improved tax compliance, on which higher tax collections are predicated, will mean that many habitual evaders would start paying tax.As the share of indirect tax in GDP goes up, prices would bump up in the year of GST implementation . The Survey is right when it says that remunerative prices for farmers and low inflation are convergent goals — but only eventually; in the short run, reducing distress on the farm would mean higher food prices.The Survey attributes most of the stress in the power sector to large additions to capacity and the welcome drop in renewable power prices. The hard reality is that continued power theft and paucity of the political will needed to make people pay for the power they consume are at the core of the crisis in power. Volume II carries forward the tradition of the Survey serving as an aggregator of relevant research and guide to applied economics for students of all ages.[This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Economic Times.]"

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

"Knee implants: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants have little basis: NPPA, Health News, ET HealthWorld","(File Photo used for representation only.)

NEW DELHI: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants over existing ones have little basis, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has concluded after examining studies published in international medical journals and consulting orthopaedic surgeons.Based on this, it feels that there is a “need to sensitize patients about limitations of these hyped technologies” and to moderate their prices – typically much higher than those for older, established implants. This emerges from the minutes of the NPPA ’s deliberations into price fixation for knee implants.It has decided to request the Indian Orthopaedic Association , Indian Medical Association and Association of Healthcare Providers (India) to sensitize orthopaedic surgeons not to push so called ‘new technologies’ with unproven claims of superiority over standard implants. The authority noted that even where patients could afford to pay the extra cost, they ought to be briefed about both the benefits and limitations of the ‘latest’ technology in comparison with the established one.One study of five widely used device technologies, including two ‘innovative’ knee implants - high flexion knee replacement and gender specific knee replacement -- concluded that none of the innovations improved functional or patient-reported outcomes.The study based on data collected from pre-market application and mandated post-market studies at the US Food and Drug Administration noted that existing devices may be safer to use in total hip or knee replacement. “Improved regulation and professional society oversight are necessary to prevent patients from being further exposed to these and future innovations introduced without proper evidence of improved clinical efficacy and safety,” stated the study published in the British Medical Journal in 2014.The NPPA examined the various types of implants based on their construction material, application and other technological aspects as the authority knew from its earlier experience with price capping for cardiac stents that hospitals, industry and surgeons would raise the issue of ‘new generation technology’ when it came to fixing a ceiling price.The NPPA noted that companies were promoting ‘high flexion knee’ implants in India claiming they have higher flexibility in day-to-day active life and sitting postures required for performing several religious and cultural practices. However, an analysis of trials suggested that “no clinically relevant or statistically significant improvement was obtained in flexion with the high flex prostheses”.“These high flexions are being sold in India at a premium in spite of the fact that its clinical long term superiority is not yet established even after a period of 20 years,” observed the NPPA.The NPPA also looked into the comparative merits of knee implants made from alloys of cobalt chromium, titanium and zirconium. The Authority found that the oldest, most widely used and clinically proven technology is implants made from alloy of cobalt-chromium (CoCr). CoCr’s limitation it that it releases tiny particles (metal ions) in the body which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.However, titanium alloy which has superior biocompatibility and enhanced erosion resistance, was found to have poor shear strength and resistance to wear. And though oxidised zirconium was shown to have less wear and tear compared to CoCr, there were a larger proportion of revision surgeries to replace or compensate for failed implants with oxidised zirconium than with CoCr.The NPPA also noted that studies and senior surgeons had found that the claimed clinical edge of un-cemented implants was yet to be established."
"ONGC: ONGC-GSPC buyout will help us develop high pressure, high temperature blocks: AK Srinivasan, ONGC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In interview with ET Now,, speaks about ONGC's GSPC buyout and what this means for the ONGC's business going forward. Edited excerpts:This deal,in which we have acquired is 80% of the PI in the block of DDW, will enable us to produce gas from the block. Along with that and these facilities which we have taken will enable us to develop high pressure, high temperature blocks which we also have in our company's kitty. This will be a very good synergy for us to develop the gas fields which are with us on high pressure, high temperature.This block is already producing. Three wells have been been drilled earlier. The fourth well is under production and is producing gas, around 3 lakh cubic meters. The fifth well is being designed to do a hydrovac and drill. The entire activity is on. This block has to be drilled for about 30 wells by 2028-2029.It is about one TCF and we could recover out of this.It is very difficult at this point of time to answer because there are a lot of other discoveries in this particular block and only when we carry out lot of exploration in that zone that the entire potential can be assessed by us. As of now the only production is happening from one of the discoveries. Three wells were already there, fourth well is under production, the fifth is likely to be completed during the year and as we go along we have to drill more wells to complete the blocks. Apart from that, other discoveries in that particular block wherein we need to explore, do appraisals - it will take some time."

"Injectable tissue patch may help repair damaged heart, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The flexible tissue scaffold, shown here emerging from a glass pipette with a tip one millimetre wide, unfolds itself after injection into the body. (photo by Miles Montgomery and Rick Lu)

Toronto: Scientists have developed an injectable tissue bandage smaller than a postage stamp that can repair damaged hearts.

Repairing heart tissue destroyed by a heart attack or medical condition with regenerative cells or tissues usually requires invasive open-heart surgery.

Researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada have developed a technique that lets them use a small needle to inject a repair patch, without the need to open up the chest cavity.

The AngioChip is a tiny patch of heart tissue with its own blood vessels and heart cells beating with a regular rhythm.

""If an implant requires open-heart surgery, it's not going to be widely available to patients,"" said Milica Radisic from University of Toronto.

She said that after a heart attack, the heart's function is reduced so much that invasive procedures like open-heart surgery usually pose more risks than potential benefits.

Miles Montgomery, a PhD candidate in Radisic's lab, has spent nearly three years developing a patch that could be injected, rather than implanted.

Researchers found a design that matched the mechanical properties of the target tissue, and had the required shape- memory behaviour: as it emerges from the needle, the patch unfolds itself into a bandage-like shape.

""The shape-memory effect is based on physical properties, not chemical ones,"" said Radisic.

This means that the unfolding process does not require additional injections and would not be affected by the local conditions within the body.

The next step was to seed the patch with real heart cells. After letting them grow for a few days, they injected the patch into rats and pigs.

Not only does the injected patch unfold to nearly the same size as a patch implanted by more invasive methods, the heart cells survive the procedure well.

Over time, the scaffold will naturally break down, leaving behind the new tissue."
"Wind power auction: India’s first wind power auction: Developers sign PPAs for 550 Mw capacity, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Major wind power developers including Adani and Mytrah Energy today signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Power Trading Corporation (PTC) for supply of 550 Mw power to states as part of India’s first wind power auctions scheme. The pacts were signed in the presence of power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal here.As per the PPAs signed, Mytrah Energy, Inox Wind and Ostro Kutch Wind would supply power of capacity 250 MW each. Further, Green Infra would supply 249.9 MW and Adani Green Energy 50 MW from their wind power projects through inter-state transmission system at a tariff of Rs 3.46 per unit discovered through open and transparent competitive bidding process,” the ministry of New and Renewable Energy MNRE ) said in a statement.""For the first tender, a tariff of Rs 3.46 per unit is great news. Feed-in tariffs can be good for initial hand-holding period and we can look ahead now. I have been told that for the second tender we have already received bids of about 2,800 MW,"" Piyush Goyal said.For these projects, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) conducted e-reverse auction on in February this year and issued Letter of Award (LoA) to successful wind power developers in April. The wind power projects under first wind auction are likely to be commissioned by September 2018.""As of today, we have 32.5 GW of installed wind capacity which amounts to only 10 percent of the total potential wind capacity. Earlier, transmitting wind energy from wind to non-wind states was a major challenge which prompted us to revise the wind policy. We are also planning to hold stakeholders sessions in order to address the challenges in the wind energy sector. The minister has asked us to come up with bids every month,"" MNRE Secretary Anand Kumar said. PTC India has tied-up this wind power for sale to power distribution utilities of various states. As part of the scheme, Uttar Pradesh would receive 449.9 MW, Bihar 200 MW, Jharkhand 200 MW, Delhi 100 MW, Assam 50 MW and Odisha 50 MW for meeting their Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).MNRE had sanctioned a scheme for setting up of 1,050 MW inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected Wind Power Projects on 14 June last year with the objective to encourage competitiveness through scaling up of project size and introduction of efficient and transparent e-bidding and e-auctioning process.Goyal also said it was time to review the need to have separate RPOs, adding the commercial aspects of such a move could be left to the states to decide depending on their requirements."

‘7 Sins of India’ – this Chinese video on Doklam is 70 kinds of funny,"Indian television news content is often criticized for being over the top. Moderators are criticized for their histrionics. The absence of reason is mourned, as is the resemblance of programming to government propaganda. But a new Xinhua video suggests that even in this game China has India beat.

Streamed on New China TV, the official YouTube channel of Xinhua news agency, which is the official press agency of the People’s Republic of China, the video features a pulchritudinous female anchor throwing peculiar new light on the Doklam standoff, topped by a faux hirsute faux Indian making a fool of himself backed by a full supply of canned laughter.

The script is pretty hilarious actually. It’s not clear to me if the scriptwriters are really taking the mickey out of India or sort of subtly subverting their own scriptmasters as well.

I have recorded the script below, with the hope that in something like the august tradition of rap battles, someone out there is going to put together a classy rejoinder:

Anchor: It’s been two months since Indian troops illegally crossed the China-India boundary but so far India has shown no sign of withdrawal at all.

When the whole world is trying to wake India up from its impulse China’s realized it’s impossible to wake a guy who is pretending to be asleep.

Faux Indian: Nobody is blaming me because I’m asleeeeep. (Snoring)

Anchor: Fine fine … let’s now take a look at what India has done during these two months which in a nutshell is regarded as the 7 Sins.

No 1: Trespassing

On June 18 Indian border troops carrying weapons and driving bulldozers illegally crossed the delimited boundary into the UNDISPUTED Chinese territory.

Yeah you heard it right, driving bulldozers straight into your house without even knocking at the door. What kind of neighbor would that be?

No 2: Violating bilateral convention

No 3: Trampling international law

You may think Doklam is a disputed area but the truth is both India and the international community have recognized the place as a part of China according to the 1890 convention between Great Britain and China relating to Sikkim and Tibet. And the thing is this exact convention is part of international law.

Didn’t your mama tell you never break the law!

No 4: Confusing and wrong

No 5: Putting blame on victim

This is kind of funny. India has been inventing various excuses to whitewash its illegal move. But first of all you’ve got to make sure your excuses can hold water dude!

India’s argued that China’s building of roads would represent “significant change of status quo … with serious security implications for India”. Would you go and take it up when your neighbor’s building a path in his garden?

Faux Indian: He’s building a path in his garden! I’m in DANGER!!

No 6: Hijacking small neighbor

Well this is most outrageous. We thought India would have been wiser after the first stupid excuse. But this time it attempted to justify its incursion in the name of “protecting Bhutan”.

Faux Indian: Don’t move – this is Bhutan’s home. I’m here protecting it.

Faux Bhutanese: (with the faux Indian waving a knife at him) No not my home.

Anchor: The Bhutanese authorities have clearly told Chinese officials that Doklam is not Bhutanese territory and they are also confused by India’s behavior.

Well I’m just wondering, how does it feel shooting yourself in the foot?

No 7: Sticking to mistake knowingly

China has a strong will to solve the problem peacefully – with the prerequisite of India’s withdrawal of course.

However India is so thick-skinned that it is on the one hand crying for talk but on the other hand refusing to withdraw.

Have you ever negotiated with a robber who had just broken into your home and refused to leave? (Nooo) You call 911 or just fight him back, right?

Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."

Chawla joins Ranji champions Gujarat for 2017-18 season

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:50 PM

""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move"" - Chawla © Getty

Piyush Chawla has ended his long-term association with Uttar Pradesh cricket in order to represent Gujarat in the upcoming first-class season, the legspinner confirmed to Sportstar. ""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move,"" Chawla said on Wednesday (August 16).

Chawla, who picked up 226 wickets in 80 first-class matches for UP over a period of almost 12 years, will now bolster the defending champions' bowling line-up which already consists the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and RP Singh, who also made the same move two years ago. It is to be noted that Chawla featured in only two Ranji games last season after getting sidelined for a major period with an injury.

The 28-year-old made his Test debut for India way back in 2006 but has since then managed to add only two more caps with his last appearance in the format coming almost five years back. With the BCCI reverting to the home-away format for the Ranji this season, the legspinner has observed the lack of help for spinners from the surfaces in UP as the main reason behind his move. ""The kind of wickets you get in the Western region which has a red soil layering help the spinners better,"" Chawla pointed out.

""When I play in Uttar Pradesh, the wickets are either seaming tracks or flat ones. That's how the weather is. So, it was time to make a move to a state where I can bowl much better and get wickets.""

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel had a role to play in the move, according to Chawla's own admission. ""A couple of years ago, when UP toured Gujarat for a match, I saw the wicket was a turner, and it was helping the spinners,"" he recalled. ""So I had told Parthiv, 'If I ever think of making a move, please keep your options open for me.'

""Last year, I only played a couple of matches for UP as I was injured. I couldn't play much, and only participated in one-dayers and T20s, because in the second game of the Ranji Trophy itself, I was injured. So, this year I was mulling a change. I spoke to Parthiv and told him about my plans. He and the officials at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) were happy with the move. I am thankful to them that they welcomed me,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: After the recent move to put a cap on the price of coronary stents, the government is working on measures to bring down the expenditure on knee surgeries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.

In his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort here, he said that cheap medicines, being made available through 'Jan Aushadhi Kendras' have been a blessing for the poor.

""The expenditure on conducting operations, on stents have gone down in our country. In the coming days, all facilities for carrying out knee operations will also be made available.

"Nuclear medical generators stuck at airports, PMO concerned, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: Reacting to a TOI report on the scarcity of nuclear generators affecting diagnosis at the country’s leading hospitals, the prime minister’s office asked doctors from AIIMS , New Delhi, on Monday to brief its officials about the issue. Over 90 technetium-99m generators, which could have helped perform nearly 10,000 life-saving scans, have been languishing at Mumbai and New Delhi international airports since August 6 and are close to expiry.TOI had reported the previous Saturday how the generators with a maximum shelf life of 14 days are stuck at airports because one of the major importers could not complete the paperwork for a new licence in time. As a result, thousands of scans to be carried out at nuclear medicine centres for cancer, heart, renal diseases had to be cancelled.Dr Chetan Patel, who heads the nuclear cardiology unit at AIIMS, said the PMO has promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of getting approvals. “Currently, we have cut down the volume of tests by 40%,” he said. The hospital has approached the government’s Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology for the key radioactive material but is yet to receive supply.Currently, in most of the 200-odd nuclear medicine centres in the country, scans have either been completely stopped or drastically reduced. “The crisis will worsen as we have been told there will be no supply in the coming weeks,” said Dr B R Mittal, head of nuclear medicine, PGIMER Chandigarh, which normally performs at least 100 scans every day. “We are forced to turn away patients,” he added.While the generators have been coming to the country since the past 30 years, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) imposed quality control last October, making it mandatory for importers to obtain fresh licences. However, an order asking the customs to restrict their import has disrupted the supply of generators since one of the importers is yet to get the registration certificate. Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh had previously told TOI that importers were given five to six extensions since last year to complete the formalities.A bigger hazard looming now is that of radiation exposure at the two key airports. Even if the generators become useless for medical consumption, they cannot be discarded like regular medical waste. Hospitals store them for two to three months before they become non-radioactive and are safe to be discarded. “Since airports don’t have any such facility, there is a risk of radiation exposure, even if minimal,” said Dr Anshu Sharma, president, Society of Nuclear Medicine (India). “The Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) has stringent regulations for discarding of radioactive materials. How will airports follow these regulations?” he said.Vishat Diagnostics, the largest importer of technetium-99m generators that supplies to 80% of the hospitals, said they won’t import generators till they get the registration certificate. Ajith Kumar from Vishat said, “We have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 15 lakh because of the government’s stance. We will not be importing any more generators till we have all the papers.”Meanwhile, patients have been badly hit. Patang Khandekar (65), who was asked to undergo a full-body scan, was turned back from a Marol hospital on Monday. “It is sad that we have wasted precious radioactive material that our nuclear reactors don’t manufacture,” said Dr G Mahapatra from SevenHills Hospital."

"Kamal Haasan Slams Govt For Failing To Curb Corruption, Revenue Minister Says He’s Got Mental Disorder","Kamal Haasan is one of those actors who has never shied away from expressing his opinions on matters concerning the nation, and he doesn’t mind getting embroiled in the controversies thereafter. Recently, after he joined Bigg Boss Tamil as a host, he faced the dire consequences and there was a big hoopla around it.

On Independence Day, the actor-filmmaker once again attacked the Tamil Nadu government on Twitter taking a dig at it for failing to curb corruption and crime in the state.

Here are the tweets:

If one state's CM should resign for a mishap & corruption under his govt. How come no party calls for resignation in TN. Enough crimes done — Kamal Haasan (@ikamalhaasan) August 15, 2017

My aim is a better Tamilnadu.Who dares to strengthen my voice? DMK AIADMK & parties R tools to help. If those tools R blunt find others. — Kamal Haasan (@ikamalhaasan) August 15, 2017

Many say that his tweets were in the reference to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who faced the demands of resignation for the death of children in Gorakhpur hospital over the past week.

In response to the same, Revenue Minister RB Udhaya Kumar, said nothing but that he thinks Kamal is suffering from some mental disorder.

“I think he wants to say something to the people but doesn’t know how to say. May be he is having some mental disorder. That’s our conclusion, he’s got some mental disorder,” he was quoted as saying.

Worst sex tips found on the internet,"You think you might get the answers you need on the internet, but sometimes, all you end up with are bizarre tips and suggestions that make you wonder why you even got online. This is true especially where sex is concerned, and so we’ve rounded up a few ludicrous sex tips that we’re sure will make you laugh out loud.







The one where you’re supposed to feed each other ice cream in the dark and lick off whatever you spill on each other.

This one is just illogical. Not to mention, it’s an invitation for ants and rodents to raid your space.

This one made us guffaw. Hold his penis and lightly slap it, and tap it back and forth like a tennis ball, and then also pinch the skin on his testicles.

We don’t know why this tip even exists.

The one where you sprinkle pepper under his nose because sneezing feels similar to an orgasm and apparently intensifies the orgasm.

And let that pepper reach his eyes and possibly hurt them?!

The uneconomical tip where you’re to bind his hands behind his back with your bra, cover your nipples in some or the other toppings and have him lick it off.

We can understand you wanting him to lick something off you, but why would you ruin a perfectly nice (and expensive) bra?

The one where you’re supposed to firmly, but without breaking skin, press a fork into his body parts.

So now we’ve graduated to stabbing each other with cutlery.

That one where you hold down on his earlobes with your fingers and use them to rock back and forth as you’re riding him.

All we can suggest is not doing this to anyone, EVER.

And then, that gem about lightly biting his scrotum.

Don’t do this. At least not until you’ve been asked to do it.

The fetish-y tip about tickling his feet with your nipples.

We’re not quite sure what this would achieve except make for a very funny scene.

The absolutely archaic tip about not making the first move because guys will think you’re desperate.

Could this be any more regressive?

That gem again where he’s supposed to bite your clit.

And we say again, never bite the genitalia unless you’re expressly told to!"
Malaysia's Petronas eyeing stake in Indian LNG import terminal,"New Delhi: Malaysian state oil firm Petronas is looking to buy a stake in Indian Oil Corp's Ennore liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, the Indian firm's chairman said on Wednesday.

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire,"COUNTY FOR ASHWIN

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 06:39 PM

""It is a blessing in disguise for both Pujara and Ashwin because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year"" - MSK Prasad © Getty

Ravichandran Ashwin, the spearhead of the Indian attack, is set to play for the Division 2 County side Worcestershire for the rest of the Championship season. He is expected to make his County debut against Gloucestershire at New Road in Division Two on August 28. Australia fast bowler John Hastings, who represents Worcestershire in the County circuit, was ruled out of the remainder of the season with a foot injury, and Ashwin slots in as a replacement for him.

""Ravi is a fantastic international cricketer who is currently in terrific form with his game,"" Steve Rhodes, the County's Director of Cricket, said.

""He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.

""It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.

""It is a really important last few games for the club and to have someone of his ilk and class and quality is a huge boost for the Club. The good thing about Ravi is he has been successful on all types of pitches in all sorts of different continents. He is a class bowler who will bowl well here,"" Rhodes added.

The off-spinner, with 292 Test wickets to his name, hasn't yet played domestic cricket in England. However, the ace spinner has now received the green signal from the board to represent Worcestershire in County cricket after the selectors decided to rest him for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

Worcestershire still have four Division 2 matches left during the County season. So the veteran all-rounder could miss out on the upcoming ODI series against Australia scheduled to start on September 17 as he looks to acclimatise to the English conditions ahead of the Test series against England next year.

Meanwhile, Chesteshwar Pujara is also set to return to the Second Division County side, Nottinghamshire. The middle-order batsman has already scored 232 runs at an average of 44.60 for the County side this season. After playing the first half of the season, he was called up for national duty for the just-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka.

Both Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire are eyeing a promotion to Division One. Nottinghamshire have 184 points from 10 matches and are placed at the top of the table. On the other hand, Worcestershire have slotted in at second position with 149 points. Worcestershire last played in Division One in 2015 when they were relegated after ending the season as the bottom-placed team with 151 points.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year,"" MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors said.

""It is always good to play and get that first hand feel of the conditions. From a selection point of view they have been rested first and then they have been given consent by the BCCI to go and play county cricket,"" he added.

Ashwin, in all likelihood, will play against his Indian team-mate, Pujara, when the Midlands County take on Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on September 5. Worcestershire are also slated to play against Leicestershire and Durham.

Nawab of Pataudi sr. (33 matches), Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan (16 matches) are some of the famous Indian cricketers who have played for Worcestershire. Zaheer, the wily seamer, had a successful time at Worcestershire, bagging 78 first-class wickets for the County.

There were also reports that experienced pacer Ishant Sharma too was to ply his trade in England, turning out for Warwickshire. The fast bowler, however, clarified on Twitter that he hasn't penned a contract with any County side. Warwickshire also have Jeetan Patel as their foreign player and were unlikely to sign up Ishant.

Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county. — Ishant Sharma (@ImIshant) August 14, 2017

There Is No End To The Toxic Foam In Bengaluru’s Lakes And It Is Only Getting Worse,"The unprecedented rains that wrecked havoc in Bengaluru on Monday have once again ignited the Varthur and Bellandur Lakes notorious for spitting out toxic foam.

The two lakes have once again started spitting out foam, covering roads and residential areas in the neighbourhood.

Videos and images posted online by locals show the foam filled lake. The thick foam is so high that it can even engulf a two-storied building.

At Varthur lake a fence was erected to prevent the foam from spreading to the road, causing massive traffic jams. But the incessant rains which damaged parts of the fence have once again resulted in the toxic waste spreading into the streets.

A video posted by ANI shows cars disappear into plumes of foam on a road adjacent to the Bellandur Lake.

The two lakes have been often referred as the symbols of Bengaluru Municipalities inability to process solid waste.

Due to the years of encroachments and uncontrolled dumping of untreated waste, including those from industries, the two lakes have transformed into fire breathing monsters of sorts.

The weed growth, combined with the stagnant water which produces methane gas from industrial waste means, a spark could turn the waterbody to source of toxic foam and smoke.

Locals now fear that the stinking foam could lead to much bigger health issues for the residents.

Karnataka government had come under heavy criticism earlier this year for its inability to cleanup the two waterbodies.

The National Green Tribunal ordered in April that all industries around Bellandur Lake be shut and imposed Rs 5 lakh fine on anyone found dumping waste in and around the lake.

The green panel gave the state authorities a month’s time to free the lake of all pollutants. But so far little to nothing has been achieved in combating the menace."
Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."
Why Walnuts May Be The Answer To Beat The Hunger Pangs You Face All Day Long,"Nuts and seeds have been touted as a staple to add to your diet for a while now. Walnuts, however, specifically have a significant role to play in your daily eating habits; especially if you’re looking to lose weight or curb your appetite.

corbis/Representational Image

A recent finding that was published online in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found out that consuming walnuts daily may activate an area in your brain which decreases hunger. According to researchers, walnuts are also thought to discourage overeating by promoting feelings of fullness.

Study's first author Olivia M Farr from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said that people often report feeling fuller after eating walnuts, but it was pretty surprising to see evidence of activity changing in the brain related to food cues, and by extension what people were eating and how hungry they feel.

SuperFoodsRx/Representational Image

To determine exactly how walnuts quell cravings, Farr and colleagues, in a study led by Christos Mantzoros, MD, DSc, PhD hc mult, director of the Human Nutrition Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe how consuming walnuts changes activity in the brain.

The scientists recruited 10 volunteers with obesity to live in BIDMC's Clinical Research Center (CRC) for two five-day sessions.

Livestrong/Representational Image

During one five-day session, the volunteers consumed daily smoothies containing 48 grams of walnuts.

During their other stay in the CRC, they received a walnut-free but nutritionally comparable placebo smoothie flavoured to taste exactly the same as the walnut-containing smoothie.

The order of the two sessions was random, meaning some participants would consume the walnuts first and others would consume the placebo first.

The findings revealed that when the participants were shown pictures of highly desirable foods, fMRI imaging revealed increased activity in a part of the brain called the right insula after participants had consumed the five-day walnut-rich diet compared to when they had not.

This area of the insula is likely involved in cognitive control and salience, meaning that participants were paying more attention to food choices and selecting the less desirable or healthier options over the highly desirable or less healthy options."
5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

I had also recommended to the finance minister that it is not advisable for an intermediate technology which reduces the fuel consumption by a little bit but otherwise that is not the future, the future is all electric cars,"" he said.""The world is moving towards electric vehicles and the country would promote electric vehicles,"" he added.--IANSbc/vm"

Rift In Pakistan Team As Umar Akmal Alleges Coach Mickey Arthur Swore At Him During Argument,"Pakistan's Test batsman, Umar Akmal has claimed that chief coach Mickey Arthur abused him during an argument at the national cricket academy in Lahore.

""I stand by what I told the media earlier today. Mickey Arthur used first poor language and then abused me. Inzamam bhai and Mushtaq bhai (Ahmed) are both witness to this incident at the NCA,"" Umar said on Wednesday.

The altercation took place between Umar and Arthur after the former returned from England following a rehabilitation programme for a knee problem and went to the academy for training. Umar said he went there after informing batting coach, Grant Flower about his need to practice.

""When I reached there first Grant and than our physio, Grant Luden refused to accommodate me saying they were only working with the centrally contracted players. I then went to Mickey and he told he was instructed only to work with the contracted players,"" Umar said.

""He then told me go and speak to Inzamam and Mushtaq. I went to them and spoke to them. They explained things to me about my status and reminded me I had failed the fitness test several times. They advised me to listen to what was being said to me. I said okay and then they told me go and talk to Mickey again,"" Umar recalled.

The Pakistan batsman said it was the second time when he went to Arthur to ask him to allow him to train with the coaches that he lost his cool.

AFP

""First he told me what I was doing at the academy. He then told me I should go and play club cricket. And then he used poor and abusive language. I can tolerate anything but I don't think anyone has the right to use such language,"" Umar said.

A PCB spokesman said that a show cause notice would be issued to Umar today as he had breached the terms of contract and clauses for players by going and speaking to the media.

""He is not a centrally contracted player but he is still bound by clauses governing players even one year after his contract expires. He can't speak to the media without first seeking permission from the board,"" he said.

Umar said he would respond to the show cause notice when it was served on him.

""I want to know that after I was dropped for the West Indies tour did I complain or blame anyone? I admitted I needed to work harder on my fitness and game.

""When I was sent back from the Champions Trophy which was a humiliating experience for me I didn't say anything or speak in the media. I only admitted I needed to improve my fitness and I had to do better.

""I went to England for rehabilitation and remained positive. But today I went to the media because the head coach used bad language and he has no right to do this with any player and I want the PCB to look into this.""

Relations between Umar and Arthur have not been ideal since last year when Pakistan toured Australia and the coach complained about the batsman's fitness levels.

"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India’s high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM’s signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM’s housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India’s proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were “cashless”. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone’s case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government’s bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state’s chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‘Mob violence is unacceptable’ (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."

Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness.

"At Least 13 Killed In Terror Attack In Central Barcelona, Van Rams Into People, Gunmen Enter Bar","Just heard what's happened in #Barcelona. All these domestic and international terror attacks need to stop. #PrayForPeace 😞❤️ — Nick (@Nick28T) August 17, 2017

In what appears to be a terrorist attack, at least thirteen persons were killed when a van rammed into people at busy central Barcelona, this evening. According to initial local media reports, a van crashed into a crowd of people in central Barcelona, one armed man had subsequently entered a restaurant in the area.

Spanish police said that people had died in the “massive crash” on Las Ramblas, a wide boulevard in an area of the city popular with tourists.

A photograph shown by public broadcaster RTVE showed three people lying on the ground in the street, apparently being helped by police and others. Catalonia’s TV3 station reported 13 dead and several injured.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."
Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev’s kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, “You (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.” Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki’s eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki’s eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, “You have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them”. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.“So you take this son back,”he told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‘any of these sons can be the cause of great trouble’. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama’s job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God’s representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies — lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion — but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki’s womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna’s appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose — of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon’s founder, insisted — as all the great acharyas also insisted — that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

"11 Reasons Why The Japanese Are Healthier, Fitter And Live Longer Than The Rest Of Us","It’s a question, which has been thrown around for quite some time now; how do the rice eating Japanese (including other countries in East Asia) stay healthier than the rest of the world?

hudsongrovepm.com

While health and fitness experts have been making outrages claims for some time now traditional practices and habits of Asian cultures is what makes them healthier than the rest. These are some the rules they live by:

They take unprocessed food out of the equation

enechange.jp

Several elementary schools in Japan serve mid-day meals that made from organically grown local foods, which leaves very little options for children to eat anything otherwise. Inculcating such healthy habits at home further changes their families mind set towards eating.

They choose rice over wheat

olagiatopaidi.gr

Studies suggest that rice intake is also associated with lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease while wheat flour increases it. It also typically free of gut irritants, phytic acid and lectins, which is useful since most people are gluten intolerant. They have it in moderation though since carbs like rice convert to sugar in your body and create sugar spikes, which can be dangerous especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic.

They use smaller plates, which results in smaller portion sizes

comorie.nifty.com

The Japanese curtail not just their food servings, but also the size of their plates. Use the side plates that you use to eat salads, and bread with to have your main meals, which are about four-to-six inches in diameter.

They eat fewer calories with every bite they take

iberitaupdate.blogspot.in

The idea is to combine a decent amount of foods that are lower in caloric density. For instance, typical Japanese meals include rice, a modest portion of meat or fish, and a couple of vegetable dishes. The idea is not to start preparing their cuisine but to include higher quantities of whole foods, and more fruits and vegetables, and cut down processed foods that have more ‘calories per bite’.

They snack mindfully

hellosehat.com

Teach your children to enjoy the treats and snacks, but in the right frequency and amount; like the Japanese who eat in smaller quantities and lesser frequencies. They exercise what is known as ‘flexible restraint’ when it comes to consuming unhealthy food.

They eat seafood every day

tourprom.ru

Apart from the protein and nutrition the biggest benefit you get from the daily consumption of seafood like fish. It keeps the level of omega 3 to omega 6 in check, which has an anti-inflammatory effect on your body, helping keep the prevalence of chronic disease at bay.

They’ve made seaweed a staple in their diet

bbcgoodfood.com

A report from the U.N. states that Japan consumes about 1,00,000 tons of seaweed a year as they add it to their main meals as well as snack on it. A cup of seaweed packs anywhere between 2 to 9 grams of protein, more potassium than a banana and is also a natural source of iodine (much more reliable than adding it to salt), which is useful in regulating your thyroid.

They stack up on a lot of fermented food

kind-eats.com

Japanese cuisine is loaded with fermented foods such as miso, soy, natto, tempeh and soy sauce (of which an average person consumes 1.8 gallons per year!). Eating fermented food has several health benefits a couple of key ones being strengthening your immune system and easing digestion that you can get just by including a few servings a week.

Most of the tea they consume is green

limia.jp

Japan ranks amongst the top ten nations in the world that consume green tea as most of the tea they consume is green. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants, which helps boosts your defence against cancer. It also reduces your risk of heart disease and even increases cognitive function. A study also claims that citizens who drank 5 cups of green tea a day a 26 percent lower mortality rate.

They make physical activity a religious part of their daily activity

edition.cnn.com

The Japanese live a very active lifestyle since childhood. In fact, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 98 percent of Japanese children walk or bike to school. This statistic only proves that Japanese children probably get in the recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity just by going to school and back.

They maintained squatter-styled toilets

introvertjapan.com

Unlike other cultures and countries, including ours, the Japanese use toilets, which require you to get into a deep squat. Squatting while crapping has several benefits over using a western-style toilet, such as loosening and limbering up your limbs as well as emptying your bowels completely (50 seconds on an average) three times as fast as it would take you on a western toilet.

Their medical system relies heavily on prevention over cure

baomoi.com

While countries across the globe have adopted a medical system that’s quick to jump to using antacids, antibiotics and NSAIDs the Japanese still inculcate heavy use of their ancient medical systems that attempt to get to the root of the problem by using healthy habits, herbs and prevention practices. That’s why meditation, martial arts and other calming rituals that strike a balance between their mind, body and spirit are still an integral part of their culture."
Junior players impress in Indian Hockey team’s Europe tour,"Indian Hockey team’s thrilling 4-3 win over Austria in the last match of their Europe tour brings good tidings for sports lovers. After a disappointing start to the tour with two consecutive losses, the team showed remarkable resilience to bounce back. The team won their last three encounters to finish on a winning note. Hockey India’s decision to blood younger players into the playing eleven seems to be slowly paying off.

The 18-member new look team had six players – Gurjant Singh, varun Kumar, Armaan Qureshi, Dipsan Tirkey, Nilkanta Sharma and goalkeeper Suraj Karkera – who made their international debut. India lost its first two matches against Olympic silver medallists – Belgium but they could draw solace from the fact that the team comprised of nine players who were a part of the winning 2016 junior world cup team. The team had managed to impress with their defence but was found wanting in attack.

After making some changes, India took on Netherlands in the Robo Cup where they surprised the opposition team with their attacking skills. Gurjant scored his first international goal for the senior team with a reverse shot high into the net off a rebound. This is the most potent weapon in his armoury that is soon going to make Gurjant one of the most feared players in the opposition’s striking circle. Varun and Armaan too impressed with their skills, they alongwith Mandeep Singh have now added more depth to the Indian attack.

India’s consecutive wins against Netherlands are also significant because the Dutch had decimated the Germans 7-1 a week ago. In the final game against Austria, India led 3-1 at the start of the final quarter but frittered away the advantage. The score line read 3-3 with a minute to go and it was almost certain that the honours will be evenly divided. But India put up a spirited performance till the end resulting in Chinglensena’s deflection off a Gurjant cross-hit that found the back of the net with seconds to go in the match.

The investment on youth pays off for India as the team finish on a high in the tour of Europe.

Read:https://t.co/jVS6qHbMvt — Hockey India (@TheHockeyIndia) August 17, 2017

One must commend Hockey India’s policy of giving exposure to young players which is crucial for the senior side’s aim of a podium-finish at the 2020 Olympic Games."
Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"
Going on record: CCTV in courts will significantly enhance judicial transparency,"In a welcome move, the Supreme Court has favoured the installation of CCTV cameras in all courts to facilitate audio-video recordings of court proceedings. This is certain to boost transparency within our courts which are anyway saddled with a huge backlog of cases. It’s an unfortunate reality that judicial proceedings in this country, especially in lower courts, suffer inordinate delays due to non-adherence to prescribed procedures. Repeated adjournments make getting justice a laborious and expensive endeavour. Such delays and backlog only undermine people’s faith in the judiciary. True, we need more courts and judges. But this by itself won’t make the wheels of justice turn faster.

Adequate attention needs to be given to procedural propriety and reforms. And it’s here that installing CCTV cameras in courts makes sense. In fact, the apex court in March had directed all high courts to ensure video recording of lower court proceedings in two districts of every state and Union territory. Scaling this up to facilitate audio-video recordings in all courts across the country will be natural progression. This will keep a check on everyone within courtroom including judges, advocates and police, and encourage responsible behaviour on all sides. Additionally, it will reduce unequal treatment meted out to different parties, threats by any person to witnesses and absence of lawyers at important stages of the proceedings.

The issue of privacy of judges doesn’t cut ice here. It’s the law of the land that all court proceedings are to be held in open court. Besides, as the top court itself has observed, constitutional courts in other countries have audio-video recordings and US Supreme Court proceedings are even available on YouTube. The apex court isn’t going there, it has stipulated that such recordings won’t be made available under RTI. Nonetheless, the recordings will mark a significant jump in judicial transparency."
Some Of India's Oldest Pictures Will Be Exhibited In London To Mark 70 Years Of Independence,"To mark the 70 anniversary of India's Independence, an exhibition is being organised by Getty Image Gallery in London. Most of these images were taken in the middle of the 1800s after the first war of Independence. Taken by photographers like Samuel Bourne and Felice Beato, these images helped generate interest about India in the western world. The pictures also give a glimpse of the life of nineteenth century India.

Bullying madrasas to celebrate Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic,"Inbound VP Venkaiah Naidu has disagreed with outbound VP Hamid Ansari over “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” creeping in among the minorities in India. Naidu says this kind of talk is just political propaganda. He says “compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due.” Perhaps the disagreement is over what exactly is “their due”. Selective food bans, anti-conversion and ghar wapsi crusades, vigilantism and ‘beef’ lynchings?

Priti Gandhi, national executive member of the BJP Mahila Morcha, has a more aggressive challenge for Ansari: “For 10 years my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power and you still feel uneasy. Agenda kya hai?” Perhaps the agenda is educating the “Hindu majority” about how its condescension is neither fair nor merited. How dare you expect minorities to act as supplicants or servile? Listen up your citizenship is not of a higher order.

In its very first year the Modi government had caused a great upset by declaring Christmas Day as Good Governance Day. This year it selected Good Friday as Digital India Day. It’s true that India’s religious calendar is very crowded but it’s also true that Diwali hasn’t been declared Ujjwala Bharat Diwas for which maybe all schools and government offices could stay open. Holi also remains a holiday. The discrimination is manifest.

And now even Independence Day is being sullied. In Uttar Pradesh state-aided madrassas have been told to submit video footage of Independence Day functions to minority welfare officers in all districts of the state. Going back to Ansari’s point, surely this kind of blatant targeting is cause for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” among the minorities. The show of distrust can hardly engender trust.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has said with a tellingly raw crudeness, “At a time when the spectre of radical Islam is a threat to the community, Muslims should welcome the move rather than place religion over nation. Respect for national symbols is non-negotiable.” This is such a shamelessly majoritarian party line. Telling Muslims what they should feel (grateful). Setting “non-negotiable” conditions for their Indianness. And of course using the spectre of radical Islam to try to push the minority into a meek corner. But bullying someone into celebrating Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic. It kind of rubs in an absence of freedoms. And that is sound reason for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity”."
"electric car: Aiming all-electric car fleet in country by 2030: Piyush Goyal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal today said the world is moving towards electric vehicles and the government is working on a road map to ensure all-electric car fleet in the country.The minister further said that although hybrid cars have cut down the fuel consumption a little bit, India will promote electric vehicles because it is the future.However, he admitted that it may take a little longer to replace existing petrol and diesel vehicles in the country.""Only electric car by 2030...existing cars may take a little longer to replace. But the government is working on a framework to see what we can do on promoting electric vehicle. Niti Aayog is currently tasked with preparing futuristic vision for electric vehicles,"" Goyal told reporters at a FICCI event.On hybrid cars, he said, ""It reduced fuel consumption a little bit but the future is all electric cars. I had also recommended to the finance minister that it is not advisable for an intermediate technology which reduces the fuel consumption by a little bit but otherwise that is not the future, the future is all electric cars.""Talking about lobbying for hybrid cars he said, ""It is a campaign being run by those companies who don't have electric vehicles. These companies have come to me also to convince not to oppose hybrid cars. The world is moving towards electric vehicles and the country would promote electric vehicles.""On certain coal mines being shut down, he said, ""I have informed the House (Parliament) that any unsafe mine will be shut.""On another round of coal mine auction being planned by the government, the minister said,""We may possibly make it more simplified framework. But there is no change in the fact that we will only give out coal blocks by auction to private sector and to public sector we can do allotments.""On the GST for equipment used for solar energy like wire or storage batteries, he explained that the all those equipment will get input credit which would ultimately result in total tax incidence of 5 per cent on the renewable source as announced by the government earlier.About the PSU ETF Bharat 22, he said, ""Shareholding of government in NTPC has been moved to exchange-traded fund Bharat-22. It is a wonderful move. It will help the government garner resources while keeping the public sector character of company intact. It is a win-win situation.""Goyal also said that during this year around 1.2 crore more subscribers were enrolled in the Employees Provident Fund system amid some claiming jobless growth in the country."

Snowball Earth: Scientists Discover How The Ice Age Helped Complex Life Evolve From Bacteria,"Two billion years ago, bacteria were the dominant species on Earth. Yet at some point in the last half a billion years, life evolved into multicellular organisms. Scientists now believe they’ve finally uncovered the details of this monumental change.

Reuters

There have been many differing theories about the beginning of this evolution, but a team from the Australian National University (ANU) have just made a discovery that could finally provide some answers as to the when and why. And it all began when the Earth was a giant snowball.

Our planet underwent an extreme ice age around 717 million years ago, known as the the Sturtian glaciation. It’s aso informally called the time of “Snowball Earth”, for the ice that covered the planet from poles to equator, and lasted around 50 million years. That ice age ended 659 million years, with an intense greenhouse period where Earth warmed rapidly. However, just as that warmth was peaking, we were hit with the Marinoan glaciation, which covered the planet in ice once more. By analyzing chemical traces of life in rocks up to a billion years old, the ANU team believe they’ve discovered how that short span between the two ice ages may have led to the evolutionary tipping point.

Called the “rise of the algae”, the research evidence shows the time period saw a rapid rise of marine planktonic algae.

“The Earth was frozen over for 50 million years,” explains lead researcher Jochen J Brocks. “Huge glaciers ground entire mountain ranges to powder that released nutrients, and when the snow melted during an extreme global heating event rivers washed torrents of nutrients into the ocean.”

REUTERS

Not just that, but the melting ice also ended up burying huge reserves of naturally occurring carbon undersea, which scientists also believe resulted in an equivalent net worth of oxygen being released into the water and air.That rise in oxygen likely also led to a rise of the phosphorus levels in water, a key component in DNA, and the energy-rich molecule ATP that provides fuel for our bodies.

With the oceans suddenly rich in nutrients, new algae evolved and thrived, allowing larger and more complex organisms to evolve as well. “These large and nutritious organisms at the base of the food web provided the burst of energy required for the evolution of complex ecosystems, where increasingly large and complex animals, including humans, could thrive on Earth,” says Dr Brocks.

What’s most interesting though, is that the second ice age didn’t reverse this process. The Marinoan glaciation ended 635 million years ago, approximately 15 million years after the previous ice age, which is the when we can track some of the oldest multicellular organisms."

IBM's AI Can Diagnose & Predict The Progression Of Schizophrenia Just By Looking At Brain Scans,"Schizophrenia may not be as common as other mental disorders, but it can have a devastating impact on a person’s life. However, research by IBM and the University of Alberta may have now discovered a way to diagnose the onset of the disease early, using a simple MRI scan and an AI.

MRI’s show the blood flow going to various parts of the brain, which IBM’s neural network can analyse to pinpoint markers for the medical condition.

“This unique, innovative multidisciplinary approach opens new insights and advances our understanding of the neurobiology of schizophrenia, which may help to improve the treatment and management of the disease,” Dr Serdar Dursun, a Professor of Psychiatry & Neuroscience with the University of Alberta, said in a press release.

The team first trained its AI with a dataset of 95 brains scans, which included both patients with schizophrenia and those who were healthy. The scans were administered as the patients completed an audio-based exercise. The neural network was then able to pinpoint schizophrenia sufferers based on the blood flow to their brain with a 74 percent accuracy.

“We've discovered a number of significant abnormal connections in the brain that can be explored in future studies,” Dursun said, “and AI-created models bring us one step closer to finding objective neuroimaging-based patterns that are diagnostic and prognostic markers of schizophrenia.”"

"Today online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate: Deepak Tomar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, CEO,, Gurgaon, India, talks on how the online pharmacy is catering to the medicine requirements of the retailers, wholesalers and people in an easier and safer way. Edited excerpts:The concept of online medicines started around 4 to 5 years ago. At that time some companies came up with a concept where a user can upload their prescription and medicines are delivered at the doorstep. The prescription however needs to be vetted by a pharmacist physically or online in order to be considered. This concept is getting a lot of support from the government of India as well. Couple of years ago, there was no provision of online pharmacy licensing. Now the government of India has allowed online pharmacy licenses in few of the states, where online orders can be taken in and the medicines can be home delivered. This online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate and currently the number of online medicine orders range somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 a day.Another company that I own, Clavex has its headquarters in San Jose, California with offices in Sydney, Australia & Gurgaon, India. It was while working on Clavex, that we got an opportunity to work with a number of pharmacies in Australia and New Zealand, health research companies in US & UK and some of the health care providers through them. It was due to an intense interaction with them, that we gained a deeper understanding of the health care industry and how the industry works. After this, I returned to India and interacted with the big names in the pharmaceutical industry in order to understand the trends and future scope of the industry in the country. After all, we know that the Indian retail economy is projected to expand to $1.1 trillion in a couple of years. There however aren’t many players who would be willing to cater to the health care sector. It is to fill this void that we came up with the concept of an all inclusive health care platform for India and see a great scope of expansion.It was two years ago that we came up with HeyCare. Most of the players in the field like Amazon, healthcart which are essentially e-commerce companies and 96% of the e-commerce companies are not into getting the pharmaceutical goods. Selling online in the smaller towns, cities, and villages is quite a challenge. Villages make up for about 50% GDP of the country and if we combine the tier 4, 5 cities and small towns with it, it accounts for 60 to 70% of the country’s GDP. The e-commerce companies are currently targeting only the 30-40% GDP of the tier 1, 2, and 3. What sets us apart from the rest of the industry is that we cover the whole country and have a clear segmentation of the country in place. The current model of e-commerce is definitely not the best suited one for it, which prompted us to come with inclusive e-commerce which essentially means e-commerce with assisted sale. The concept of assisted sale is assisting the retailers who are already selling in these villages. Currently the e-commerce companies are getting the products sent in by the retailers into their warehouses, and then send the orders to the consumers. The retailers are barely making any profits as they are also paying warehousing charges. This model is, hence rarely profitable. What needs to be done is to go hyper-local. You can send the medicines to the retailers and they can then take care of the logistics. This is the model that we are introducing with HeyCare and another parallel brand.HeyCare is a B2C platform for first world India that is the tier 1, 2, and 3 cities where users can come online, make an appointment with the doctor, upload the prescription and get the medicines delivered at home. In case there are any tests prescribed by the doctor, they can be booked with the diagnostics lab, and a representative would come collect your samples from home. The reports will be uploaded on the same application and accessed easily by the user. For kids especially there is a vaccination reminder feature and a pill reminder function, especially for the elderly. The money transactions are also pretty simple here which is managed by a special dedicated wallet within the application called Care Wallet. These are the features currently developed in the application.While interacting with numerous pharmaceutical companies, a common pain point came to light, that is distribution. The supply chain here is exceptionally long consisting of a country head, regional heads, then state heads and CNF, supervisors of distribution, distributors, wholesalers and then retailers. It is for this reason that the margin really thins out for each of these entities. HeyCare steps in here and offers a direct connection between these pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. HeyCare would provide a complete retail distribution channel thus fattening up the margins for both, the pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. This model also eliminates the fear of counterfeit medicines as these activities are rife at the super distributor and distributor level which is out of the companies’ control.The future of HeyCare in India is the development of a highly efficient retail distribution channel in the country which would then act as a third party distribution channel for its first world healthcare industry. Once the system for the first world India is regularized and implemented effectively, we intend to expand the channel across other industries as well. The biggest advantage here would be an efficient and common payment platform for the consumers, retailers and wholesalers which would ease up the transactions for everyone. It is pleasantly surprising that some of the bigger names of the pharma world are approaching us to sign on with us and eliminate the hassle of maintaining a physical retail distribution channel while opting for the online distribution channel with HeyCare. The model of companies like Micromax mobiles where they chose to go exclusively on sale with Flipkart is slowly being emulated in the pharma industries too. HeyCare has, in fact bagged quite a few contracts with the pharmaceutical companies that are partnering exclusively with us and we would be their exclusive online distributors."
"UP government slashes medical education budget by 50%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LUCKNOW: As the death of 23 children in a single day in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) grabs national headlines, a sharp cut by the Aditya Nath Yogi government in the budgetary allocation for medical education this year is raising questions.

The allocation for BRDMC followed the pattern, plunging from Rs 15.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7.8 crore for 2017-18. More specifically, its allocation for machines/equipment was slashed from Rs 3 crore to just Rs 75 lakh.The budgetary allocation fell across all medical colleges. For example, the medical colleges in Kanpur and Allahabad saw their allocations come down from Rs 15.9 crore each to Rs 3.3 crore and Rs 4.2 crore, respectively."

"Cairn moves court against ITAT order on capital gains tax demand, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Cairn UK Holdings Ltd today moved the Delhi High Court against tax tribunal ITAT's order holding the company liable to pay Rs 10,247 crore as capital gains tax on transfer of shares it did through an internal reorganisation of its Indian business in 2006.

A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Pratibha M Singh said the matter will be heard in due course and if it does not, then the parties, including the tax department, can move an application for early hearing.

Cairn in its plea has challenged the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's March 9 order by which the UK-based company was held liable to pay Rs 10,247 crore as capital gains tax.

The company had approached ITAT after it was slapped with a tax assessment order of Rs 10,247 crore in January 2014.

The I-T department had raised a total tax demand of Rs 29,047 crore on Cairn, including Rs 18,800 crore in backdated interest.

In its plea before the ITAT, Cairn had said the assessing officer had ""erred"" in raising the demand by invoking the retrospective amendment to section 9 of the Finance Act introduced in 2012, which was not on the statute when the India-United Kingdom Tax Treaty was entered into."
"Over 10,000 Batteries Of Refurbished Galaxy Note 4 Units Are Being Recalled For Overheating","It seems like Samsung just can’t catch a break. News is now coming out that over 10,000 batteries for the Galaxy Note 4 are being recalled in the US, on the grounds of overheating risks.

This is far too similar to last year’s Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, but there may be a bit of a silver lining for Samsung. While the Note 7 had a manufacturing flaw in every single unit’s batteries, the current problem with the Note 4 is far more limited. More importantly though, Samsung itself may be blameless here.

Though some phones seem to be overheating, they all seem to be refurbished devices that came from AT&T’s insurance program and handled by FedEx Supply Chain. Supposedly, along the way, some of these devices had their batteries replaced with counterfeits, making the sub par ones overheat.

Thankfully, the Note 4 has a removable battery, so users aren’t sending the entire device back as part of the recall. They can instead just buy a new, officially licensed battery for the device.

Though the Note 4 itself is almost three years old now, the refurbished units in question were sent out between December 2016 to April 2017. There haven’t been any reports of the device catching fire or exploding so far, but Samsung isn’t taking any chances."

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

KL Rahul could be the answer to Team India’s long-term No.4 riddle,"By Chetan Narula

In the last season or so, India’s ODI record has wavered. They played just eight at home, all in preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy, winning 5-3 against New Zealand and England. For what it’s worth, they did finish runners-up in the quadrennial event. And whatever plans the team management charted for that tournament worked — barring Pakistan in the final, of course.

Yet they have to redraw the plans for the 2019 ODI World Cup and the team management has identified the wobbly No 4 spot as the weakest link. And with two years remaining, now is a good time to start working on it. “KL Rahul will bat at No 4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. He is too good a player to be left out of the playing eleven at this time,” said coach MSK Prasad this past week.

Rahul has climbed the charts very quickly in the last year or so, and has gained immense confidence from the dressing room in his abilities across formats. As such there are two ways to look at Prasad’s comments.

One, the Indian team has decided upon its opening combination for the near future. Rohit Sharma is steadfast at one end, while Shikhar Dhawan — with three international hundreds (and another four half-centuries across formats) since June — has bought himself more time.

And it is the continued inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane that confirms Rahul’s future batting spot. The latter had missed out on the New Zealand series last October due to a hamstring injury, and scored only 24 runs in three matches as he opened against England early this year. He was then unfit for the 2017 IPL and missed the Champions Trophy, both due to a shoulder injury. This resulted in Rahane being chosen as the back-up opener for the Champions Trophy.

Prasad was clear that Rahane would not be a middle-order choice as Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were picked. When Rahane opened in the Caribbean (as Rohit was rested), the debate was sealed — he is no longer seen as a No 4 option. Second, Rahane came into the ODI side as an opener and it was the same line of thought — that he was too good a player to be left out — by then-skipper MS Dhoni that saw him shunted up and down the batting order over the years. The result has been an unstable No 4.

There is no denying that Rahul has climbed the charts with great efficiency, and whilst doing so, has shown a sense of adventurism in his game. When he burst onto the scene in 2014-15, he was seen as a compact opener for Test cricket. Over the next year or so, he added various dimensions — mostly attacking stroke play — to his game. The result was easy to see in the 2016 IPL — he scored 397 runs in 12 innings at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 146.49.

The point is that he scored those runs batting in the middle-order and complementing the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Rahul was afforded the opportunity to make his ODI debut thereafter and he scored 100*, 33 and 63* in his first three ODIs (albeit in Zimbabwe).

That was nearly 15 months ago, and much has changed since, including Rahul’s own improved ability to score runs.

There is no doubt that he merits a run in the ODI format and yet this move leaves room for doubt. Rahul moving down to No 4 will only be a repeat of the Rahane experiment.

It gives rise to further questions. How long will they persist with Rahul in the middle order if he is not successful? And what does this mean for Manish Pandey, who has been waiting for a way back into the ODI eleven since autumn last year?

It’s a coin toss for now. Heads, they win and Rahul solves India’s long-standing problems at the No 4 spot. Tails, they go back to the drawing board. At the least they have two years to figure it out."

Why Our Ancient Ancestors Slept Less Than Us But Had More Energy Than We Do,"The presence constant light emanating from artificial sources such as our light bulbs and the fully lit screens of our smartphones often get blamed for the discrepancies in our sleep patterns. Although, there is truth in that we should be holding our ancestors more accountable for feeling sleepy at odd hours or not feeling 'refreshed' after a full nights sleep says a recent study.

maeemdia.com

You’d think our ancient ancestors got at least eight hours of solid sleep in a cave, right? Well, it turns out our ancestors had to take regular short bouts of naps during the day and stay up for short periods during the night to keep a look out for predators and other rival groups of humans.

The study published in the Proceedings of the Royals Society B indicates that their sleeping pattern ensures that one or some people remained awake while the others slept; making sure the person asleep (the more vulnerable to attack) is being looked out for.

keywordsuggest.org

The researchers from the University of Toronto studied the sleep patterns of the Hadza People of the Tanzania who still live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that originated thousands of years ago.

After monitoring their sleep patterns over 20 days and nights they found that there were only 18 minutes when all 33 tribe members were asleep at the same time. There were at least eight people on an average that remain awake through the night at a given time.

kuchnia.wp

The researchers also stated the younger Hadza lot were termed as ‘owls’ since they stayed up late during their procreation years and the grandparents were referred to as ‘larks’ because they woke up early and sleep poorly.

“Researchers have theorized that one of the reasons grandparents live so long past their reproductive years is that their function is to take care of grandchildren,” says David Samson, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. “Our hypothesis is that their lark behaviour and shorter sleep times serve a function: the elders serve as sentinels at the times of day when others are sleeping. Therefore, it’s important to have people of all ages in any population,” as stated by the University of Toronto.

Whether you’re a young adult or an older one the only way to get complete sleep is to nap in short bouts after all!

Morocco wants travellers find answers to intolerance,"Morocco’s efforts to discuss peace is not exactly making breaking headlines but it is indeed unique and has been lauded by one and all, including policymakers in Washington, Moscow and Beijing, even New Delhi. And there are enough reasons why global diplomats are loving the idea.

Tangiers, the Moroccan port city that once lured American composer Paul Bowles and French writer Jean Genet, is asking new generation travellers and peacemakers to visit the sleepy city this November discuss what would drive peace and mutual tolerance across world.

The second edition of the International Festival of Ibn Battuta, themed on the Moroccan globetrotter who once travelled to India and even worked as a judge for some years, attempts to find answers to some of most difficult questions of modern times revolving around intolerance and religion. Ibn Battuta, whose extraordinary journeys that spanned nearly three decades, himself tried hard to find answers to global strife caused by reasons stretching from religion to race, power to rebellions.

The festival, an unique one, will open up important discussions to understand world history and its changing traditions to the next generation, it will also discuss why growing intolerance is becoming the biggest bane of societies across the world. In some ways, this is Morocco’s international engagement with neighbouring and distant countries, the idea is to understand the world through extensive travels.

Mohammed Dekkak, a senior organiser of the festival, argues why the current global geo-political scenarios highlight an extraordinary connection of Morocco to other nations. He feels Morocco’s open-minded international relations will open up multicultural societies, sustainability, ethics fostering peace and mutual tolerance, all through travel. Dekkak – confident different countries with different races and cultures can still sign a common charter – speaks the mind of Ibn Battuta: Travel is the language of peace, important to drive in meaningful conversations. Dekkak firmly believes every traveller is an ambassador of peace, a citizen of the world.

Conversations will drive the show, there will be business as well.

Some of the world’s most powerful economies have their eyes on Africa and dialogues in and around Africa are gaining popularity across the world. It is happening mainly because of the continent’s wealth like diamonds and oil, besides Africa offers great agrarian opportunities. The festival in Morocco assumes importance because of the country’s highly competitive, emerging economy. Tangier – ironically Ibn Battuta’s hometown – is a melting point between Africa, Europe and the Arab World.

The former Indian vice president, Hamid Ansari, was in Morocco last June, pushing bilateral trade, among the deliverables phosphates used for fertilizer, extremely valuable to agrarian societies such as India. Moroccan phosphate resources are among the most extensive in the world, with only China and the United States reaching similar levels of production. In return for phosphates and other resources, New Delhi is keen to boost Morocco’s automobile and pharma productions.

But at the heart of everything, lie conversations, serious, stimulating conversations. Like the Vienna coffee stores which offer the first cup free so that people accepting the offer start their conversations and then, buy the second cup, the second edition of this unique conference could open up interesting conversations around a subject that has rattled the world for over a decade: Growing intolerance."
Facebook & Instagram Will Be Rolling Out Tweaked Newsfeed & Comments To Make Them Easier To Use,"Facebook is has announced a redesign for its two most popular apps, Facebook and Instagram. The two are both receiving changes to make them more visually appealing, as well as easier to comprehend at first glance.

Facebook is losing the blue header and trims across most of the app’s interface, which they’re saying will make it easier to navigate and more consistent. Additionally, the comments are being changed to look more like chats in Messenger. Instead simple line breaks, each comment will get its own gray bubble

Even profile pictures are changing from squares to circles, more like how Twitter’s design is. Lastly, the Like, Comment, and Share buttons have been made slightly larger, to make them easier to click, and are being decolorised save for an outline.

Instagram meanwhile, has its redesign focused on comments. Comments on each image will now be organised into threads, just like on the Facebook app. That way, differentiating between a new comment and a reply to someone else’s comment should be easier.

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"GST will not be an obstacle for solar growth story: Gajanan Nabar, CEO, CleanMax Solar, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: CleanMax Solar , one of the biggest solar-rooftop firms in India, has recently bagged a Rs 700 crore investment from US-based private equity firm Warburg Pincus . In a conversation with ETEnergyworld, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Gajanan Nabar talks about the investment, impact of GST on the company’s business and the need to make the solar sector self-sustainable.Edited excerpts:As India’s largest rooftop solar developer with a market share of 24 per cent, the funding will primarily be utilised to maintain our leadership position. While we currently operate solar farms in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, we will use the funds to continue our rapid growth in the open access solar power markets in India. Additionally, we are keenly looking to increase our sustainability product offerings to corporates by venturing into energy storage solutions by combining it with Rooftop Solar plants. International expansion is also on the cards, with our operations in UAE set to commence shortly.The introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), which is the single largest tax reform by the Government of India, is an excellent initiative to bring about the ease of carrying out business. Under the gambit of the GST, the solar power plant, which is the input, is taxed, whereas electricity as an output is not taxed. As a result of this, we have unusable credit on GST, which is a minor challenge in the cost competitive solar Industry. However, we are trying to offset this by offering improvements in quality and reduced construction time. Overall, while there are initial hiccups till we fully comprehend the system, the long-term benefits of GST will outweigh them and will not be an obstacle for the solar industry growth story in India.Subsidy is not a sustainable thing for any sector in the long run. It is required for any new technology or business model in order to bring a disruptive change to begin with. However, it is not stable in any economy to continue with it. The government is doing the right thing since the cost of solar projects is going down and the performance is improving, the industry can eventually function on its own.We are doing a lot of our businesses without any subsides.From the rooftop perspective, net-metering is certainly one. Wheeling and banking charges are also a challenge. In some states, there are no wheeling and banking charges for open access. But there is still a long way to go as the sector is just emerging. I do feel the overall approach of the government is very positive. As an industry, we can keep asking for more subsides but that is not how you want to build a sustainable business. Let us not forget that we are very dependent on imports and that is one element which is beyond the ambit of the Indian economy. Trade relationships and other geo-political challenges come into play. What is required is more clarity on vision, alignment of discoms with state governments and boards with central government.Not currently but it is on the horizon and we will certainly look at it.It is around 300 MW which includes rooftop. We are seeing exponential growth in rooftop as we more than doubled the business last year. So we are hoping to continue like this. We have installed over 100 MW as of now. We are also looking at international markets -- the Middle East and Southeast Asia."
Healthy Food Or Naughty Snack? Fitness Blogger Debunks Claims About Some Of Our Favourite Grub,"Lucy Mountain would have been just another fitness blogger, but she isn't that ordinary. Her stories and blogs are serving as the gospel truth to everyone who is obsessed with the food they eat.

With the recent health awakening of the world, it almost seems like everyone wants to know what they are eating, the calorie intake, the protein intake and other rudiments associated with it. In this rush, people often forget how they're being conned by big brands or social coercion.

Lucy's website is all about comparing foods and doing a visual food comparisons to prove her point.

Many would choose the almonds because even though they'd prefer Fruit Pastels, almonds would make them feel more ‘on track’ mentally - which again, is totally fine "" she wrote, explaining the difference.

""When the majority of my diet has consisted of well-balanced food that’s full of micronutrients, I have no issue eating something that’s less so just because I love the taste of it. This is just a personal choice… ‘Healthy’ to me is exactly what I make it. And Fruit Pastels (in moderation) make me happy which I believe contributes largely to my overall health.”

8. Fat loss food versus fattening food

“No single food will cause weight-gain. Eating more calories than you’re expending constantly over a period of time will do this. Equally, no single food will cause weight-loss. Eating less calories than you’re expending constantly over a period of time will do this.”

9. 100g milk chocolate versus 100g gluten-free, wheat-free, milk-free chocolate

“As you know from my recent posts, I’m about enjoying ALL ze food and there is nothing I cut out of my diet that I like the taste of – no matter my goal. Learning how to manage portion sizes has allowed me to achieve this!”

11. 100g milk chocolate versus 100g 85% dark chocolate

“For those of who genuinely love dark chocolate, keep doing you. However, if you PREFER the taste of milk, but force yourself to eat dark because you’ve read it’s ‘healthier’, just have the milk chocolate and enjoy it. In terms of weight-loss from a calorie perspective, it’s actually more beneficial and will raise happiness levels by 938% (unproven stat).”

12. Just two different types of salads with the same ingredients

13. Smoothies

“Now some people have a smoothie as a meal, others have them as a snack – and either way, that’s totally fine. However, if weight-loss is your goal, being more mindful of what you throw into your smoothies could really make a difference.”

14. 100 calories of strawberries vs. 100 calories of strawberries





“Don’t get me wrong; dried fruit is waaaay easier to eat when you’re on the go (ain’t nobody got time to whip out a punnet of strawberries lol). So they could be a good option if convenience is the priority. But when fat loss is the goal, 300g of fresh strawberries is likely to be more satiating.”

A lot of people fall prey to brand promotions and alleged healthy things at the store, but it's important to know what is going in your system. Brand promotions can be extremely fallacious and such eating habits can be detrimental."

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"Selling LEDs at petrol pumps a major step in boosting oil companies’ non-fuel retail business: Pradhan, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government’s latest move to make LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances available for sale at petrol pumps will give a major fillip to oil companies ’ business arising from segments other than fuel retail, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.The retail fuel outlets of Oil Marketing Companies witness a total footfall of over 35 million every day. “In order to take advantage of this to enhance the non-fuel retail energy business, LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances from EESL will be sold at ROs. The Ministry had recently taken the decision on daily pricing of fuel to prevent huge distortions in margins in the retail business. This step of selling LED bulbs will also help in the margins of retail outlets ,” Pradhan said.The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking an initial pact between the three OMCs – Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) – and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) under the power ministry for selling of LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances at over 55,000 pumps across the country.Pradhan urged EESL and OMCs to develop a viable business model for the retail outlets in the next six months. The oil companies will help in branding and marketing of the UJALA Scheme – the government’s flagship initiative to promote LED bulbs -- at all their retail outlets thereby making petrol pumps attractive to customers. “The RO dealers will directly conduct business with EESL and would get around 10 per cent margin,” Pradhan said.The OMCs have been tying up with other stakeholders, too, to develop their non-fuel retail business at retail outlets. A pilot launch of tie-up with Mother Dairy Safal outlets has been carried out in Bhubaneshwar in Odisha under which customers are expected to get fresh and quality vegetables and fruits at affordable rates at the petrol stations.BPCL has also entered into a tie-up with In & Out retail chain at their ROs. HPCL is also in the process of tying up with retail chains of the market to expand their business at ROs. Pradhan said the Janaushadhi Stores under the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers will also be opened at ROs in the future.Apart from this, Common Service Centre (CSC) concept of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is also being explored to be brought to the petrol pumps. Under CSC, citizens will be able to avail many Government-to-Citizen and Business-to-Citizen services including PAN, E-Aadhaar Cards, utility bill Payments, banking solutions and Agri Services."
"Draft emission norms for diesel locomotives in two weeks: CPCB, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has told the National Green Tribunal that the draft emission standards for diesel locomotives will be finalised within two weeks.

The apex pollution monitoring body told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar that it would place the interim norms before August 30, the next date of hearing.

""The counsel appearing for CPCB submits that within two weeks the interim guidelines will be placed on record,"" the bench noted.

The lawyer appearing for CPCB said the emission standards for diesel locomotives were still to be decided and they would send to the MoEF after finalisation.

The submission came in the wake of the green panel's direction to set standards in this regard and ensure that the railway locomotive engines don't cause pollution.

The CPCB's interim report, titled ""Exhaust Emission Benchmarks for Diesel Locomotives on Indian Railways"", aims to fix standards and protocols for the sector to achieve the targets submitted by India under the Paris climate change agreement.

According to the report, the contribution of emissions from the transport sector on the whole has risen 3.5 times since 1990 to stand at 250 million tonne carbon dioxide, or 13.5 per cent of the total emissions in 2013.

The Railways contributed 9.7 per cent of this figure (24.7 million tonne). Globally, however, only 3.5 per cent of the emissions from the transport sector are attributed to the rail sector, CPCB's report said.

""The changes in the energy sources allowed for a reduction of the share of rail transport carbon dioxide emissions from 24 per cent in 1990 to less than 10 per cent in 2013, while rail activity doubled in the same period,"" the draft report by CPCB said.

Earlier, the tribunal had directed MoEF to hold a meeting with the CPCB and Railways and submit a report on emission standards for diesel locomotive within six weeks.

However, when the matter came up for hearing, the Environment Ministry sought more time, saying ""the standards are yet to be fixed and one year's time is required for completion"".

The Railways had earlier submitted international standards for emissions from diesel locomotive railway engines and filed a data sheet indicating the emissions from 30 railway engines.

According to the data sheet, the emission levels in the tested 30 railway engines were much above international standards.

The directions came during the hearing a petition filed by Dwarka resident S K Goyal about harmful emissions from diesel locomotives."
India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers,"By Neeraj Kaushal

Steve Jobs, it is said, advised President Barack Obama that colleges in the US should staple green cards to the diplomas of graduating foreigners. Bill Gates made a similar recommendation in an article in The New York Times sometime back. Alas, President Donald Trump is unlikely to heed their advice. But the Indian government should.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges. India is more deficient in skilled workers, relative to its needs, than almost any major country. The most recent Manpower Talent Shortage Survey reported that almost two-thirds of Indian employers surveyed experienced difficulties in finding workers with required skills.

Expat’s Got Talent

The only other country where employers reported greater difficulties in finding required skills was Japan whose working-age population has been shrinking for a quarter century. Meanwhile, India is awaiting a demographic dividend, which requires substantial investments in education and training.

Let immigration policy not be an obstacle in attracting talent. It is likely that the welcome mat to foreign students will not immediately attract many from East Asia, Southeast Asia or Latin America. Our neighbours —Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka —will be the most immediate source of talent. We should offer to give residency permits to graduating foreign students and skilled workers, including those from South Asia.

For security reasons, Pakistani students may have to be kept out. But we have the potential to make India a highly attractive place of learning and work to the most talented students from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Initiatives to proactively recruit the best PhDs, Indian or foreign, in Indian universities would make them more attractive to foreign students.

We get a large number of African students, who prefer India to the US or Europe. They find Indian universities academically strong without being prohibitively expensive. But they face racism and discrimination simply account of the colour of their skin. The best of Africa are as good as the best of anywhere in the world. We have the potential to attract the best from Africa, train them for Indian needs, offer them permanent residency and a path to citizenship.

In western countries, a substantial proportion of scientists and skilled professionals are foreign-born. Switzerland tops the list with 57% of the scientists, working and studying, in the country being foreigners, according to the GlobSci Survey of 2011. The corresponding figure is 46% in Canada, 45% in Australia, 38% in the US, 33% in Britain, 23% in Germany, and 17% in France. The proportion of foreign scientists working or studying in India, in comparison, is negligible: less than 1%.

Critics would argue that liberal immigration of foreign talent would adversely affect Indian skilled workers. In 2000, similar sentiments sent domestic politics in Germany on fire with the ‘Kinder statt Inder’ (Children not Indians) slogan in response to the government’s policy to allow foreign-born computer specialists. Talent shortages continued, and five years later, the German government announced an even more liberal immigration policy.

Critics might also say that India has its own millions to educate. Why should it use its resources on foreigners? International scientists, professionals and entrepreneurs make the rich world rich. If India wants to get rich, it needs to create policies and build institutions that attract foreign talent to supplement its skill requirements. China also has its millions to educate. But it has recognised the importance of mobile foreign talent.

Going for the Skill

Its leaders openly acknowledge that the biggest obstacle to future growth in China is talent. For this reason, it has been aggressively wooing foreign talent and sending its own youth to acquire state-of-the art skills abroad. In 2008, the Chinese government announced the ‘thousand-talents’ programme.

Highly talented research scientists and entrepreneurs are lured to this programme from around the world. It has launched a China Green Card, a permit for permanent residency, for certain groups of skilled foreigners and Chinese expats in Shanghai and Beijing.

The contribution of foreigners in raising innovative potential and economic prosperity is most visible in the US, where one of every five doctors is foreign-born, as are two of every five medical scientists, one of every five computer specialists, one of every six persons in engineering or science occupations, one of every four astronomers, physicists, chemical and material scientists, and one of every six biological scientists.

Since 1990, academics associated with US institutions and universities have won close to 65% of all Nobel prizes in chemistry, medicine, economics and physics. But less than half of the recipients were born in the US. Many European countries have been trying, rather unsuccessfully, to compete with the US for foreign talent. This is an opportune moment for these countries to roll out the welcome mat to foreign talent.

Foreign students who feel harassed by the US Department of Homeland Security could move to other countries with more liberal immigration regimes. India should join the race and offer easy residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges.

Such a progressive, growth-oriented immigration policy goes well with the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ (the world is one family) laid out in the Upanishads.

Will Amazon Prime Video and Netflix be the upholders of free speech,"Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have been racking up a number of deals of late. The online streaming rights for Padmavati starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been sold to Amazon Prime Video for a rumored Rs 20-25 crore. Padmavati is rumored to have been made at a cost of Rs 180 crores by the director of the film Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

Is this going to be the new norm for film makers? It could well be. Salman Khan has offered Amazon Prime the rights to stream his movies even before their television premiere. Yash Raj films, T-Series and many others have been reported to have signed similar deals.

With more than 2000 screens across India, multiplexes are an attractive option. USA with more than 40,000 screens has over 125 screens per million of population. India has a measly six screens per million people. Multiplexes may not de-risk the creative expression.

Getting the movie to the right number of screens is not a task for the faint hearted director. Even if the movie is slated to be shown for a week at a multiplex, the fate of the movie is usually decided over the weekend. If there is a blockbuster movie released in the same week, the audience will go to watch the bigger draw. Hence a movie made with a smaller budget does not have the staying power to survive another week at the multiplex.

During the shooting of Padmavati, the director was assaulted by the workers of Rajput Karni Sena who also vandalised the sets of the film. The vandals were peeved by what they claimed was the “distortion of historical facts”. They were offended by the manner in which Alauddin Khilji was shown to be obsessed with Padmavati’s beauty. It is easy to expect that multiplex owners will hesitate to screen Padmavati lest the vandals destroy the movie theatre after watching the movie. You never know who will be offended.

This may mean that a film maker who decides to make a movie that may not be the usual song and dance kitsch that is the standard fare of Bollywood is at risk. Of course Padmavati is not the first movie that has courted controversy. Songs have had to be dropped or have their lyrics modified to appease a group that has been offended. Anyone can take a film or an artiste to court or beat them into silence. Comedians have been told that their brand of humor is offensive and have been hauled up before courts. Artists have been threatened because their depiction was not acceptable.

For the film makers, writers, lyricists and comedians, the streaming giants may offer a safe haven where opinions that are not palatable to the majority can be expressed. The stand-up comedians can do their routine without fear of a backlash other than the market forces. If viewers do not watch the shows or rate it poorly, the artistes will be taken off the air or at the very least not invited back. Free speech that challenges our worldview may thrive in the fringes while the mainstream cinema continues to dole out what is safe but bland. That may be another form of the digital divide."
"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.“We will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,” said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."
"Al Gore to give keynote at US clean energy summit in Las Vegas, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","LAS VEGAS: Former Vice President Al Gore has agreed to be the keynote speaker at a national clean energy summit in Las Vegas this fall.

Former Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid and Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval are co-hosting the Oct. 13 event.

Reid launched the first summit 10 years ago, and Gore - who won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize - was the keynote speaker in 2009.

Reid said that Gore is the ""most prominent environmental activist in the world today.""

The ex-Senate majority leader says Gore will help lead a bipartisan conversation about the importance of developing clean energy to combat climate change at the October gathering with the theme ""Integrating Innovation.""

Sandoval says Gore has played a key role in stressing the need for state and local governments to help create clean energy solutions through infrastructure and local economies."
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
"GST: Piyush Goyal rules out review of 5 per cent GST on solar equipment, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Amidst reports that there is still lack of clarity on the 5 per cent goods and services tax (GST) levy on solar equipment, Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal has reiterated that there is no ambiguity as the government is very clear on the issue.

""There is no question of ambiguity on this. It has been made very clear that 5 per cent GST will be applicable on solar equipment. If they (equipment makers) still have issues with it, it is very sad and we cannot do anything,"" Goyal, who was in the megapolis, told over the weekend.

The industry has claimed that though the government has said GST would be applied to solar modules at a concessional rate of 5 per cent, there is still no clarity on whether it will be extended to other equipment as well.

""The Goods and Services Tax was introduced to bring in more clarity and transparency in the system. I think our stand is very clear in this,"" he said.

Goyal further said the ambitious plan of increasing solar capacity to 100 GW by 2020 and promoting solar products would boost small and medium enterprises.

""We have set a target of 40,000 MW of rooftop solar capacity by 2022. Small and medium enterprises can take active participation in this. Apart from this, there is scope in sectors like solar pumps, solar streetlights and energy- efficient systems among others,"" the minister said, adding ""the country is moving from a job-seeking to job-creating economy""."

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
"India long way off from ideal GST, may not get there: Bibek Debroy, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi, India is a long way off from the ideal GST structure and it may not get there anytime in the near future, says NITI Aayog Member Bibek Debroy , who favours three rates.While asserting that the move towards the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a good one, Debroy says it would have been much better if it had lesser number of tax rates.""My view -- for which the government is slightly upset with me -- is that we should not have been here (the current GST) but we should have been much closer to the ideal GST,"" Debroy told IANS in an interview.""Once we are here, I am not very convinced that we will actually get there (the ideal GST).""Debroy said that ideally, there should be a single GST rate, but at present ""depending on how you count it, you have seven rates"".""Every economist would argue for one rate but no country in the world has that. But instead of seven rates, have three rates,"" he said.While the government's stand has been that the system would eventually move towards lesser number of GST rates, Debroy said it now seemed to be a difficult shift.""My point is that we don't know what those rates would be. Let's assume they are 12, 18 and 24 per cent, which sound reasonable. Can you imagine the tax rate of a product currently at three per cent increasing to 12 per cent? Really tough,"" the leading economist told IANS.Gold and gold jewellery are currently taxed at three per cent under the GST regime Debroy said that the experiences of other countries had shown that growth and revenue increases happened through increased efficiency when all products were included and there were a maximum of two or three tax rates.""Therefore, when people say rate efficiency, it will happen, but not right now. In terms of revenue increases, probably not that much beyond the extension of the base, because many more people are brought into the net,"" he said.Debroy said that an ideal GST removes all indirect taxes, puts all items under its purview and has a single rate.""Ideal GST is still a long way off. Most countries in the world that have moved towards the GST have taken more than 10 years to reach there -- if they ever have reached there,"" he said.The NITI Aayog Member said that while there are statements floating around that 140-150 countries in the world have GST, but that's not really the case.""What they have is VAT (Value Added Tax) without the service sector being integrated. Proper GST exists in not more than six to seven countries in the world.""""And out of these six-seven countries, with the exception of Canada, all are unitary countries -- that is, where the central government decides,"" he said.In a country like India, there can't be the central government unilaterally deciding on the rates and several other issues, he said.""Automatically, we are therefore talking about the dual GST and about the GST council . Now, when you have the GST council with all of the states having different perceptions, even if you assure compensation for revenue losses, what you will have is a long way off from the ideal GST,"" he said.""So you will have a lot of products outside the GST like electricity, petroleum products, liquor and tobacco... And depending on how you count it, you have seven rates, not a single one.""Debroy said that a positive way to look at it is that there has been some movement on the issue and that waiting for the ideal GST would have taken 20 more years to generate a consensus.""So on balance, even as a complicated thing, it's a very good thing that has happened. But it could have been better."""

Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test © Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Demonetisation revealed Rs 3 lakh crore black money, says PM @narendramodi https://t.co/LtJmN0RgzE pic.twitter.com/j26ALppVor — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 16, 2017

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

Yen for Lutyens: The old boy shows up in the least expected places 😜,"The British architect is celebrated in song and coveted in bungalow. Those drunk on nationalistic power clearly see no contradiction in desperately wanting to live in a colonial hangover. Some of the great unwashed who wash up in Parliament commit their own atrocities as tenants of these colonnaded gems, and, now, in the nightly battle hymn of the Republic, the bitterest grapes of wrath are roared at the ‘Lutyens elitists’. Despite all this, Sir Edwin created a lasting legacy: architectural, social and, we thought, uniquely Indian.

No-ji, he was the go-to/must-have architect of the civilised world of the 1930s. His imprimatur is also on the cenotaph in London’s Whitehall, country seats in Britain, and the World War I cemeteries of Northern France. A couple of days ago, when the echoes of India at 70 resounded at his Kingsway aka Rajpath, we found him in – Liverpool.

Actually, the city of the Beatles hadn’t seen him ‘standing there’ for nearly a century. But now the ‘Lutyens crypt’ is the latest tourist attraction on Hope Street, the world’s only avenue with a cathedral at each end: the largest Anglican one in the UK, and the modernist Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King where a recent restoration project revealed Liverpool’s best-kept secret.

Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design a cathedral. In 1933, the foundation stone was laid, and the first stage, a crypt, was built. Then WWII put paid to every civilian activity, followed by the familiar story of inflation. The entire project was shelved. But the Catholics still wanted their cathedral. An Anglican architect won the competition, fulfilling the two criteria: it shouldn’t cost more than a million pounds and it had to be built in five years. Btw, the Anglican cathedral’s designer was Catholic, and it took 70 years.

The grand halls of Lutyens’s once-forgotten crypt house, apart from three tombs, the cathedral’s priceless treasury and historical exhibits. In the edifying blend of sacred and secular now common in the West, it’s also the venue of, et al, the annual beer festival.

What would make Sir Edwin turn in his own tomb? To be reviled as ‘elitist’ in India or, closer home, be glorified in ‘a monument to the greatest building never built’?

"Now, energy efficient appliances to be available at petrol pumps, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: In a bid to boost the government’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) scheme, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) under the ministry of power today signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Oil Marketing Companies ( OMCs ) for distribution of energy-efficient appliances across petrol pumps.According to the agreement, the distribution of energy efficient appliances including LED bulbs , LED tube lights and energy efficient fans will be taken up at select retail outlets of Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ), Hindustan Petroleum Corp ( HPCL ) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation ( BPCL ).“Both UJALA & Ujjwala are clean energy movements aimed at making lives of poor easier. The MoU between EESL and OMCs is a partnership for the smart people who want to save electricity,” Power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal said at the signing ceremony.Goyal also added India would be the first country in the world to shift 100 per cent to using LEDs for its lighting needs by 2019. As part of the pact, EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by OMCs barring manpower and space, EESL said in a statement.“The consumer can purchase high quality 9 Watt LED bulbs for Rs 70, 20 Watt LED tube light for Rs 220 and five-star rated ceiling fans for Rs 1,200,” EESL said. The power ministry aims to use the vast network of the three-public sector OMCs of over 54,500 petrol Retail Outlets (ROs) throughout India.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme . This has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW, the statement added.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."
"By creative policy, not rigid rules","Is the central government wrong to mandate private participation in any metro rail project it part-finances? Metro-man E Sreedharan thinks so, emphatically. He can list a number of instances of failed private participation in India and abroad. Rigid rules on the nature of ownership of infrastructure projects do not make sense, whether for or against private participation. The Centre can limit its participation in a project put up for co-financing to a level it thinks fair, given the size of the population of the city the metro seeks to serve. Beyond that, how the concerned state or local government seeks to finance it is not the Centre’s business. Malayalis who work in West Asia have funded airports in Kerala on considerations other than financial returns. That said, it does not make sense to bar private investment in any kind of infrastructure.

The bulk of the trillions of dollars of global savings seeking profitable deployment anywhere secure comprises non-state funds. It makes eminent sense to draw them into creating much-needed new infrastructure in the developing world, whose economic returns would be significant. If commercial returns do not capture the full extent of economic returns in a particular project, deterring private investment, the government can remedy that in many ways.

An outright subsidy is one option. More desirable would be measures such as levying a carbon tax on petro-fuels and congestion charges on road use that would make the fares needed to make a metro commercially attractive seem perfectly acceptable in comparison with travel by road. Would this not be a big burden on the common man?

Cheap transport for the urban commuter ultimately subsidises the business that employs that commuter. If this subsidy is removed, the costs and revenues of the business would reconfigure, that is all. Clean transport would improve health and lower healthcare costs as well.

Simply mandating a private role in infrastructure would not work. Supplementary action is required to make it attractive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure. That calls for policy innovation, not diktat."
Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. “She was an audacious woman who could hold her own,” she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda — who initiated her in brahmacharini vows — Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‘Nivedita,’ one who has dedicated her life to God.“She was a remarkable person.I don’t think we have focused enough on her,”says Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita’s life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master’s views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta’s Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta’s elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita’s 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.” Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.“Swami Vivekananda had said that it’s not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It’s a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,” says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. “Nivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,” elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.“ She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission — Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.” “Her nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India’s identity,” explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita’s sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. “Patriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it’s about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it’s not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.” In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms — from her extensive travels across the country — her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:“India must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion — the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.” Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.“Tradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it’s not about this and not that. It’s about inclusive Vedantic theory,” says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore’s Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.“One had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.”
