Ties that bind: Rakhi doesn’t work if made compulsory,"In a new twist on an old tradition, the Daman and Diu administration asked all its female employees to bring rakhis and tie them on their male colleagues’ wrists. While a rakhi often comes in handy for north Indian women in schools, colleges and workplaces to friendzone men and scotch any romantic interest, this may be the first time that it has become a matter of official fiat. The order was quickly withdrawn after protests, but that it even occurred to the officials of the Union territory administered by the home ministry, is telling.

In their own defence, the officials said they were doing it to spread ‘brotherhood’. But why is it the administration’s problem to enforce any relationship at all between professional peers? Rakshabandhan is a sweet festival, as a reminder of sibling bonds. But it does rest on the patriarchal premise that men protect their sisters, who shower them with sweets in exchange for their own survival. Even the friendzoning with rakhis is a troubling phenomeon – it’s a band of placation, for a culture where a woman’s consent and refusal are not valued.

But whether or not one approves, the tradition is deeply meaningful in north India. Ultimately, it is for those who participate in it to argue, accept, or revise it. But meanwhile, an office of the government, where men and women work as equals, has no business injecting these skewed “relationships” into the workplace."
How it helps to be discreet after a breakup,"Any separation is painful. Some might say that speaking to a lot of friends about your breakup and unburdening yourself on social media can be cathartic. Or they might advise you to go for a radical image makeover (think purple/silver hair and tattoos) following a heartbreak to tell the world that you have moved on. Some even host parties to celebrate breakups these days. All that is fine, but there are benefits of being low-key about your breakup as well:

Give Room For Imperfections,"What is the ultimate and g r e a t e s t truth of life? Is it to be happy, or to make one’s family happy, or to serve humankind, or to reach the Divine?



■The ultimate journey starts with one step.Just do not sit and dream about the ultimate. Instead, begin your journey towards the ultimate. Take small steps towards the Truth; towards this inquiry into life:‘What is the goal of life?’This very inquiry can take you far. Everything has some significance in life. Just eating alone is not the goal of life.Yet eating is essential for sustaining life. Isn’t it? Similarly, sleeping is not the goal of life. But can you discard sleep altogether? No,you cannot. In the same way, you have to be happy and you also have to make others happy.This is the journey towards the Ultimate. What is the Ultimate Truth, or the ultimate purpose of life? One who really knows will not tell you, and anyone who does tell you,simply does not know.That is the secret. Children don’t care about their parents when they grow up.



Where do we fail as parents and what is your advice to parents so that this situation could be controlled?



■ That is why I say that it is important to instill the three types of trust in your children — trust in oneself, trust in the goodness of others, and trust in the Divine.A little bit of moral and spiritual values, and the way you treat your parents and ask them to treat their grandparents can make an impact on them. From a young age, tell your children to take care of their grandparents.They will start being sensitive this way.



How do I know if my child is into drugs or just moody?



■ That’s why it is important for you to know them and their friend circle. You will get to know what they do, where they go and keep a tab on them, especially when they are in their teenage. Teenage is a very difficult time. Teenagers are undergoing so many biological changes and so they are not just satisfied with the love of their parents. They look for love from outside — through emotional support or physical pleasure.Their mind is in such confusion. So, to deal with teenage children is a big task.



Sometimes dealing with kids gets so tricky that I tend to lose my patience. Every day, I decide to be calm, but when the situation arises, I am not able to control myself.What should I do?



■ You can’t do anything about it now, you have to live life spontaneously. It is okay to sometimes lose your temper, never mind.You should leave a little room for imperfection in life, and start accepting. Some kids are there to teach you a lot of lessons, and it is okay for mothers and fathers to sometimes get upset with their kids.You don’t have to bring them up with sweet words all the time. Then you will make them very weak. I have seen parents who have never scolded their children.These children when they grow old,they can’t stand any criticism. A little criticism,a little disrespect from someone or a little bit of failure rattles them. They become so upset because they never experienced anything like that at home. So, at home, being upset with kids sometimes is like giving them a vaccination so that they get stronger. But don’t take this as an excuse to get upset all the time with the kids; it does not work.Too much of it is also bad. If you are scolding your children every day on a routine basis, they become so thick-skinned and they go all the way to the other side,which is also not good. A little dose here and there is okay.





How do I deal with the rebelliousness of my kids?



■ Negative suggestions call for rebelliousness in the mind. If you say,“Don’t do it”, then the mind says,“Why? Let me do it!” The mind calls for rebelliousness. But if you say,“You can do it, only you won’t get the results”, then you don’t leave a chance for the mind to be rebellious, then it takes the knowledge in. I remember one dentist would tell kids who would ask,‘Why should I brush my teeth’;he would say,“No,you don’t need to brush the teeth that you don’t want, you only brush the teeth that you want to keep!” So, move from negative suggestions to positive ones; this is important. When there is strong bonding, then negative or positive suggestions don’t matter. It’s only when the bonding is not very strong that negative suggestions call for rebelliousness in the mind. There is so much competition in society that kids have no time to relax.There is a fear that they will not fit into society.



How do we handle this situation?



■ You shouldn’t push them too much.You should teach them to relax. Music, meditation and some games will help.Take some time out to play games with your children — this is very important. Tell your children ‘Compete with yourself. How you did last year, see whether you are doing better this year’, that’s healthy competition.



How to deal with my child asking too many questions?



■ Children ask questions and often they are not looking for an answer, they move on whether you answer or not. Children are not stuck in questions like adults. Adults get stuck in questions, and ask the same questions ten times; children don’t care.The spirit of inquiry comes to their mind, they ask a question and move on. So, you shouldn’t take it too seriously.

Comeback man Rubel Hossain targets bowling varieties,"BANGLADESH PACER'S RETURN

Comeback man Rubel Hossain targets bowling varieties

Atif Azam • Last updated on Wed, 02 Aug, 2017, 04:56 PM

Rubel Hossain hopes to unleash his 'butterfly' delivery - a variation he has been working on for years © Getty

Bangladesh pace bowler Rubel Hossain is confident that he can come up with some bowling varieties that he had been trying for years after joining the Bangladesh preparation camp after recovering from an injury.

Rubel sustained an bizarre injury in his jawbone during the Champions Trophy by hitting the door in team's hotel in Birmingham and was out for several weeks due to it.

The 27-year pacer, reputed to be the most experienced pacer in the current Test squad, joined the ongoing conditioning camp last week only after recovering from a surgery that he underwent on his injured face.

Though he remained wicketless in the two Test matches that he played so far since the beginning of the 2015, he was confident of doing well in the longer formats.

""You might have seen that I bowled with different action since the New Zealand series as I was working on my 'Butterfly'. Hopefully, I would be able to continue to bowl with it,"" said Rubel on Tuesday in Mirpur. ""I'll bowl with such action in upcoming BPL as well as in the ODIs and Twenty20s against South Africa.""

Rubel said that he will try out his 'Butterfly' delivery that he could not execute perfectly despite trying it many times since 2011.

The butterfly is a slower one that is bowled with the ball gripped at the top of the fingers. With the action, the ball doesn't have any revolutions in the air and could be deceptive.

""I am trying this delivery[Butterfly] for a long time and hopefully I can execute it to the best of my ability in the upcoming days,' said Rubel. Rubel said he was eager to learn consistency from Bangladesh bowling coach Courtney Walsh, the first man in history to get 500 Test wickets.

""I have many things to learn from him [Walsh] as his Test record is very rich. I'll try to learn how I can bowl consistently with good line and length and how to take wickets as well,"" he said.

Rubel was looking to improve his batting under new batting consultant Mark O'Neill, who was told put a special emphasis on the tailenders. Mark joined Tigers for a short stint and is looking forward to help the lower-order with their technique. ""I'll try to learn how I can support the batsmen in crucial situations and how to bat in odd situations. I'll try to take these tips from him.""

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."
Sell Air India for one rupee: Right now it’s a giant black hole relentlessly sucking in taxpayer money,"Recently the Cabinet gave in-principle approval to sell Air India. It is an oft-repeated idea, but this time the resolve seems to be stronger. Government will really be doing our country a huge favour if it gets rid of this company, which is a giant black hole relentlessly sucking in taxpayer money.

As an ex-distressed banker, i can say this: some companies can be rescued from the hole they have dug themselves in. Others have dug it so deep, they can never, ever get out. Air India is in the latter category. There is no point saying, “But last time i flew, the service was good.” It’s irrelevant. The hard truth is this: the company is a dud. Sorry.

Here’s the math, as an example. Imagine your neighbour has a drinking problem because of which he racks up loans of over Rs 5 crore. But instead of earning money and paying back the loans, he continues to borrow even more and spends another Rs 70 lakh a year on his addiction. Over the decades you have rescued him several times. However, he refuses to change. Now the loans are too big. Even if he did try his best, he can’t make more than a couple of lakhs a year. Hence he can never repay his debts.

To understand Air India, multiply the numbers in the example above by 10,000. It has over Rs 50,000 crore of debt and is cashflow negative, reportedly by over Rs 7,000 crore a year – the numbers could be worse, as the company hasn’t released recent data and CAG has raised issues even about the data it has released.

Even in the best of scenarios, Air India can’t earn enough to repay its debt. So no new buyer can buy it as-is, with its mountain of debt. For there is no scope to repay it. Financially, right now Air India is the worst corporate in the country.

There’s no point in casting blame. When sins have been done over decades, no one person or set of persons is to blame. One does feel bad for the 20,000 plus employees, who may even be working hard at running the company day to day.

But the black hole is going to remain just that, and the taxpayer is paying for it. Air India’s annual cashflow loss is equal to what Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher owes banks. Air India costs us one Mallya a year, money that can be used to build hundreds of hospitals and schools.

Many lame arguments are given to not sell Air India. These include arguing that it is the flag carrier. Well, many countries no longer have flag carriers (including America). In other cases they don’t cost government so much. Flag carrier pride for a passenger airline is stupid. Air India is not the Indian Air Force.

Air India’s role in rescue efforts is also tom-tommed. Well, it beats all logic to keep such an expensive operation on standby for occasional rescues. It’s better the Centre gives money to private airlines in an emergency. Do we really think if there is a rare, genuine calamity, and government wants to pay to hire a plane, IndiGo and SpiceJet are going to refuse? And isn’t this far more efficient than burning Rs 7,000 crore a year?

These two noble arguments to keep Air India alive as-is hide the real reason. It is the neta’s and babu’s club in the sky. Politicians and bureaucrats, along with their families, friends and neighbours, all abuse Air India to get free upgrades and slavish service from the staff. Getting Air India off the government’s hands will end these VVIP joys.

Even if we want to pamper netas and babus, there are cheaper ways. Paying them money to fly business, or even first class, in private airlines will be cheaper than keeping the Air India monster alive. Government can buy upgrade vouchers for its senior functionaries.

So how does one sell Air India? Its assets, office infrastructure, running operation and landing rights have some value – though well below its debt. Government should give it to the highest bidder amongst various private players. Of course the bid is unlikely to pay off the entire debt, so the winning bidder will probably be someone who wants the least discount on the loan.

Employees may be retained or retrenched, something the new buyer will decide. But a decent retrenchment package (say three years’ salary) for the entire staff would cost around Rs 9,000 crore (given a salary bill of Rs 3,000 crore a year). The new buyers will take that into account in their bid.

Even in the best case, government will have to give a discount on the loan. It may even have to give the company to the new buyer for one rupee. The process will not make government any money. But it will get rid of a part of the loan and all of the cash burning enterprise. To that extent, this entire exercise is not so much a sale of Air India as good riddance. This is something we need to understand going into the sale, so we don’t have unrealistic expectations from it.

Beware opposing voices that will complain after the sale, “We sold Air India for nothing.” Tell them, we didn’t sell it, we got rid of it, and that has saved us a lot of money every year.

Let’s all keep up the pressure to ensure that the Modi government sells Air India. We will be doing the country’s finances a big favour."

‘Feels good that I’ve made my father’s dream come true’,"Theirs is a story of grit and determination; theirs is also a story of braving sexist statements, pushing the physical limits, and dismissing all odds stacked against them. Almost all players of the Indian women cricket team we interviewed during the exclusive Femina photo shoot after their return from London after the World Cup had the usual 'cricket is not a girl’s game' and 'how will you be able to play cricket' statements passed at them. Almost all faced misogyny from the days of gully cricket well into their professional lives. And yet, they all emerged victorious to not only represent a sport that the nation obsesses over, but also to put the country on the world map of cricket. In an ongoing special series, we feature their stories, chronicling the hardships they faced and how they hit each one out for a six.







“Fortunately, I have a cricketing background—my father and brother used to play cricket. So my family found it pleasantly surprising, I think, that I wanted to play cricket too, and so, they supported me even more. I started off watching my brother play, and I've learnt a lot from him, especially from the way he bats. My father had a dream that one of his children would play for India, and it feels good that I've made it come true.” --opener Smriti Mandhana



Mandhana was the first Indian woman to score a double hundred in an ODI game, four years ago, and among the two Indian women selected for the Women’s Big Bash league last year.

"Pakistan and India must return to the negotiating table, without further ado and preconditions","I am leaving New Delhi shortly, after completing my tenure. I regret our two countries could not commence the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue as agreed in December 2015. Be that as it may, i for one would not like to think we are destined to live in perpetual hostility.

In a significant move, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attended Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi’s inauguration along with other SAARC leaders. That reflected our sincere desire to make a new beginning. The two PMs in their maiden meeting agreed to resume bilateral dialogue as soon as possible. After such a propitious start, the press conference by the then Indian foreign secretary issuing a charge sheet against Pakistan, when PM Sharif was still in town, was unhelpful to say the least.

We also found India’s decision to cancel its foreign secretary’s scheduled visit to Islamabad in August 2014 in reaction to my interaction with the Hurriyat leadership quite baffling. It is imperative to find an amicable solution to the Jammu & Kashmir dispute. And a solution that does not find resonance among Kashmiris would ineluctably fall flat. Simply put, we cannot put the J&K dispute on the back burner.

We must settle this once and for all, as well as Siachen and Sir Creek, to build a permanent peace between the two countries. I am aware that many in India are not yet convinced that J&K is the root cause of our troubled relationship. They hold the view that terrorism is the major issue. To them my submission is that the wars our two countries have fought during the last 70 years all predated the Samjhauta Express blast (2007), the Mumbai attacks (2008) and Pathankot (2016). Effective diplomacy is not about glossing over or shelving seemingly intractable issues but to address them conclusively and satisfactorily.

This is not to say the menace of terrorism can be ignored and left unaddressed. During the last three years, the “Zarb-i-Azb” operation has successfully achieved its objectives. Now the all-encompassing “Raddul Fasaad” operation is underway to take the counter-terrorism drive to its logical conclusion. The public discourse aside, Islamabad and New Delhi have exchanged letters on Mumbai. Some proposals are under consideration to expedite the trial.

As for Pathankot, it is in our mutual interest to determine beyond a shadow of doubt its fons et origo and bring the culprits to book. Meanwhile, it is necessary to eschew the temptation of jumping the gun about perpetrators of the crime. Convicting the perpetrators of the Samjhauta Express blast in which 42 Pakistanis lost their lives is equally important. The people of Pakistan are concerned at the glacial pace of the trial.

To move from conflict management to conflict resolution, a few suggestions. First, it is time to return to the negotiating table without further ado and preconditions. Talks are not a favour by one country to another. Dialogue is unavoidable. Since it will happen sooner or later, why waste time?

Second, it is incumbent to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LoC. In his 2015 address to the UNGA, Prime Minister Sharif proposed to formalise the 2003 ceasefire understanding, entrusting UNMOGIP to monitor. Third, all the other existing CBMs/agreements should also be adhered to in letter and spirit. Fourth, Pakistan in not interested in a Sisyphean arms race but will maintain the credibility of its full spectrum deterrence under all circumstances. Our 1998 Strategic Restraint Regime proposal is still on the table. Maintaining regional strategic stability should be one of our top most priorities.

I may mention here that while foreign secretary S Jaishankar never denied me an official meeting, i wish we could also meet privately to discuss bilateral issues informally. Similarly, i met NSA Ajit Doval many times. We also exchanged gifts on the occasions of Eid and Diwali. As bilateral relations deteriorated, Doval Sahab’s interest in meeting me also apparently sapped somewhat. I strongly feel that diplomatic interaction becomes all the more necessary in strained situations to avoid culs de sac.

To conclude, i thank the people of India for their warmth and affection. These three years have been very exciting. I and my wife Summiya have made many friends across India. We would always cherish their friendship and look forward to staying in touch with them."

Stand firm: Prepare for a long haul with China on Doklam,"Even though there are some signs that the India-China standoff in Doklam is thawing on the ground, Beijing is keeping up its strident rhetoric. In its latest tirade, China warned India of “serious consequences” if the latter did not pull back its troops from the contested area in the India-China-Bhutan trijunction region. To its full credit, New Delhi has been firm that Doklam is Bhutanese territory and Beijing’s road building activity there is in clear violation of the 2012 agreement that stipulates trijunction boundary points are to be determined through mutual consultations. Plus, New Delhi has been clear that both sides should withdraw troops from the area simultaneously.

It’s also commendable that instead of matching Beijing’s vitriol, New Delhi has been calm yet firm on Doklam. This sends out a clear message to China that it can’t expect to quietly nibble away at others’ territory. Besides, India has security obligations with respect to Bhutan and strategic sensitivities of its own vis-à-vis Doklam. Hence, Chinese unilateralism can’t be the last word on the matter. However, having ratcheted up the matter, Beijing finds itself painted into a corner. With an important Chinese Communist Party congress coming up later in the year, Beijing is unlikely to retreat from the standoff any time soon.

Given this scenario, New Delhi should prepare for the long haul in Doklam and wait things out. As far as overall India-China relations are concerned, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has stated that India’s roadmap is peace and that Chinese investments in India have gone up in a big way. This is a subtle hint to Beijing that it stands to lose the most in a trade war, as it runs a $51 billion surplus with India currently."
Trending down: A cut in RBI policy rate is welcome but more must be done to boost the economy,"Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee (MPC) yesterday lowered its policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first change in 10 months. The current rate, 6%, has now been brought down to the level that existed over six years ago. The change signals two things. One, MPC is now more sanguine about the trajectory of inflation. Two, the reduction in interest rate has come amidst signs that industrial performance remains lacklustre. Given this context, MPC’s decision is welcome but it is unlikely to make a meaningful difference to the economy.

Interest rates have been trending down for a while. In the backdrop of slowing growth of bank credit, deposit rates have been constantly lowered. Recently, State Bank of India lowered even savings rates for most of its deposit holders. On the other side, interest rates for borrowers have not declined proportionately on account of the bad loans plaguing banks. But there has been more activity from non-banking financial intermediaries and India’s top companies have been able to benefit from the current environment. It is the smaller companies, the ones most dependent on banks, which have missed out.

The benign environment for borrowers has not translated into a revival of investment demand. MPC’s statement pointed out that the number of new investment announcements fell to a 12-year low in April-June quarter. Part of the problem can be traced to the collapse in global trade following the financial crisis, but there are levers the government can use to improve the situation. The immediate need is to carry through with the resolution process of bad loans following the promulgation of an ordinance in May. This must be supplemented with measures to ease doing business, which would substantially improve the investment climate."

"Robin Uthappa Still Working Hard At A Team India Comeback, Might Turn Up For Saurashtra In The Ranji Trophy","Karnataka batsman Robin Uthappa will not play Ranji Trophy for the Kerala state team after all. The India international, who won back-to-back treble with Karnataka, on Friday sent a request to the Saurashtra Cricket Association to play for their team.

He is trying to win back a place in the national team and this might be a step towards that as he looks to get back on the radar of the selectors.

bccl

“We have received the application,” said Himanshu Shah, SCA media manager. “But we haven’t confirmed him as our player yet. The association will take a call at a later stage after discussing with the parties concerned like the coach and captain.”

bccl

It’s understood that Uthappa sought to move out of Karnataka after being dropped over his inconsistent form (328 runs in seven games) in the previous domestic season. He secured a No Objection Certificate from the Karnataka State Cricket Association in June and was immediately touted to play for Kerala. “We tried to stop him,” KSCA secretary Sudhakar Rao said.

“We had two meetings with him but we couldn't convince him to stay. He had his own plans. ‘I've played here; now I want to play elsewhere,’ is what he said. We tried to retain him. But we can't force anybody.

He has reached this level only because of this ctate. The final decision was his. Wherever he goes, our best wishes are always with him. He is our boy."" Uthappa was the highest run getter in Karnataka’s 2014-15 season with 912 runs in 11matches, including two centuries and five fifties.

bccl

In the previous season, he played only five matches and managed 374 runs with a hundred and two half-centuries. He was ‘rested’ for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against Tamil Nadu and fell out of favour with the then Karnataka coach, J Arun Kumar.

Karnataka eventually lost that match despite boasting of India internationals Manish Pandey, Karun Nair and KL Rahul, and suffered a premature end to their season. Given that Saurashtra will miss Ravindra Jadeja and Cheteshwar Pujara due to national duty, Uthappa will get ample opportunity under captain Jaydev Shah.

The naming of seas: The associated problems and their resolutions,"In May 1988, the Times of India (ToI) reported on an issue riling readers of Pakistan Times, a now defunct newspaper that was then owned by the Pakistani government. This was the name of the Indian Ocean which they felt was unfairly linked to this country simply because “by calling itself India the country seemed to have become heir to the entire history of the subcontinent.”

One writer felt that the fairer approach would be to limit the use of India up to August 1947 and after that “what remained outside Pakistan and Bangladesh should be called Bharat.” But since the Indian government had not been so obliging, writers felt Pakistan should not go along with this historical and geographic appropriation and should stop using the term “Indian Ocean’.

One writer proposed calling it the Indo-Pak Ocean as a fair solution. A more diplomatic correspondent felt this would annoy other countries in the region, but suggested that, because many of these countries were Islamic, the Muslim Ocean was the right term. “All Muslim countries should agree to such a proposition and the matter should be taken up at the Organisation of Islamic Conference,” he says.”

Pakistan’s irritation with the Indian Ocean name goes back even further. In March 1971, ToI reported on a presentation made by Latif Ahmed Sherwani of the Pakistani Institution of International Affairs at a seminar in Georgetown University, Washington DC, on Indian Ocean affairs.

Sherwani pointed out that the Mediterranean wasn’t known as the Italian Sea, despite Italy occupying a prominent position in it, just as India did in the Indian Ocean. So in the same way a name should be used that was more respectful of the many countries around the Indian Ocean’s rim. He suggested calling it “the eastern ocean or the Afro-Asian ocean.”

Even further back though, an objection to ‘Indian Ocean’ came not from Pakistan, but Indonesia. In July, 1963 ToI reported the startling news that Indonesia’s President Sukarno wanted Indonesia’s Navy to call the Indian Ocean as the Indonesian Ocean and his Chief of Staff of the Navy Eddy Martadinata had issued an order making the change. Martadinata later became ambassador to Pakistan where he may have enjoyed meeting others peeved about the persistence of ‘Indian Ocean.’

CHINA’S POSITION

Matters of sea are important to Indonesia which is a nation of islands. This includes the Natuna Islands, an archipelago of 272 small islands that lie in a part of the sea where they rub up against China. That whole area is generally known as the South China Sea but last week the Indonesian government said that the part near their islands would now be called the North Natuna Sea.

China’s response was predictable. “Some countries so-called renaming is meaningless,” said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. Some idea of Chinese views about the region can be seen in a statement made at an international conference in 2015 by Chinese Vice Admiral Yuan Yubai, who stated bluntly, “the South China Sea, as the name indicates, is a sea area that belongs to China.”

The Chinese government’s position on the sea is inherited from its predecessor, the Republic of China (RoC). In the aftermath of World War II the RoC released the Nine-Dash line, a map with nine dashes encompassing nearly all of the sea between the Chinese mainland and the countries of South-East Asia, all claimed for China.

After the RoC collapsed and moved to Taiwan, its communist successor continued to maintain the claim (though the RoC in Taiwan has never officially dropped it either).

WIDE GULF

An even more intensely felt maritime dispute in the region has been running for decades over the name for the sea between Korea and Japan. The general convention is to call this the Sea of Japan, but South and North Korea affirm passionately that they always called this the East Sea and that its appropriation by Japan continues the humiliating colonisation of Korea by Japan and atrocities committed during WWII. The Koreas have pleaded in multiple international meetings for at least parity, with both names being recognised, but Japan remains stonily unresponsive, inflaming the matter even more.

Another dispute over maritime naming, in a particularly volatile region, is over the Persian Gulf. The ancient Greeks referred to this as the Sinus Persicus, with Sinus Arabicus (Arabian Gulf) sometimes used for what became more commonly known as the Red Sea. The six Arab countries who border the Persian Gulf strongly feel that their control of around 70% of the coastline gives them the right to rename it the Arabian Gulf now.

Iran refuses to countenance this even though, ironically, it has moved away from the term Persia in most other ways. The term Iran, which derives from Aryan, applies for most of the country, except in matter concerning the Gulf. There is an official National Persian Gulf Day on April 30th, the top Iranian soccer teams play in the Persian Gulf Pro League and airlines found to be using any term other than Persian Gulf on their in-flight information systems are banned from flying in Iranian air-space.

According to a paper by Martin Levinson, following the Islamic Revolution of 1979 there were moves to promote the term Islamic Gulf – which presumably the Pakistani proponents of the Muslim Ocean would have appreciated. This idea disappeared after the start of the inter-Islamic Iran-Iraq war, but apparently was revived by Osama bin-Laden and used as a term to rally Islamic militants.

BUILDING BLOCKS

This underlines the larger dangers of maritime naming disputes. Land based naming disputes are numerous, but they tend to settled by the brute principle of physical possession. Laying claim to the open sea is harder and it is partly why opponents try and enlist more solid features like continental shelves, shoals and reefs as a way to buttress their position (China has been accused of actually building islands for this purpose).

The real problems come with the economic benefits which, inconveniently tend to be less easy to pin down. Sea lanes for ships tend to be in the most open waters, submarine oil and gas fields stretch in unpredictable directions and shoals of fish which, as they dwindle through overfishing are increasingly desperately sought after by national fishing fleets, and are the hardest of all to demarcate in national areas.

ACCIDENTAL OWNERSHIP

In all this India is something of an exception. Our name attaches to one of the largest maritime expanses of all, but the country has never seemed too concerned about defending this. Periodically our politicians boast about the blue-water ambitions of the Indian Navy and the potential of Indian Ocean commerce, but they then go back to land based issues. Coastal issues are literally marginal in India, with fishing communities struggling to receive the same attention paid to farming ones.

This might reflect the fact that our ownership of the Ocean name is somewhat accidental. As with most things involving the predominantly Western developed system of cartography, it was first used by the Greeks tracking the sources of the prized spices and textiles from India. As Martin W.Lewis explains in his essay ‘Dividing the Ocean Sea’ (1999), the Greeks began the somewhat arbitrary division between sea (thalassa) which meant the Mediterranean for them, and the wider Oceanos, the world of sea that lay at the edge of the world of land.

Travel and trade made them refine this view and from fairly early on the term Indikon pelagos was used for the seas around India. The Roman geographers who built on their knowledge occasionally made a distinction between the waters closer to India and the open sea they knew existed beyond Ceylon, which they called Mare Prosodum or the Green Sea. Other terms were used like Oceanus Orientalis, Ethiopian Ocean (for the parts closer to Africa) and Mare Barbaricum, but probably following the traders who actually sailed the seas, they always came back to Indian Ocean.

BHARATIYA OCEAN?

This persisted through the 16th century as increasing knowledge from the global voyages of explorers like Magellan lead to the creation of the first atlases. The Atlantic has received its name from the Greeks, who saw it as the edge of the world, held up by the giant Atlas, but then explorers broke through to the Pacific, after sailing down south and surviving the storms of Cape Horn at the tip of South America, to come to the more peaceful seas to its north.

Explorers going north and south added the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, although geographers have argued about whether these count or not. Different divisions have given the seven oceans that, in number at least, correspond to the seven seas of ancient Arabic and Indian legend, or four oceans, or even just one – as one geographer pointed out, if you invert the globe and look from the South Pole there is just one vast sea with three great bays that are the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.

Even in this the Indian connection remains, and oddly the only threat to it might come from ultra-nationalists who believe in elevating the term Bharat over India. They argue that this internal name should be the external one too, ignoring the long global history of the use of India. They might want to consider how imposing this change would delight maritime minded Pakistanis since the chances of getting the world to accept the idea of a Bharatiya Ocean accepted are nil."
India and Pakistan: They got the generals Part 2,"My last blog post argued that while Pakistan got its generals as a ruling class, India got its bureaucrats who overly complicate and mess up things for the rest of us. Look, for example, at India’s new GST structure that was supposed to simplify things. But even sweets can be taxed four ways — from 5% all the way upto 28% — and it’s hard to figure out what tax rate might apply to the particular dessert you have confected.

Plain barfi is taxed at the lowest rate of 5%, but if it happens to have a chocolate layer on top the tax could be 28% (at least that’s what a reading of the rules indicates, although no one knows for sure at this point – see this TOI article). Dhokla makers are quaking lest their product be identified as ‘cake’, and thereby heavily taxed. This is way beyond ridiculous. Layered sweets may be delicious, but a GST this layered ends up as counter-productive.

Our bureaucrats and politicians (like the Brahmins of yore) excel in separating out things into multiple grades, so that they can retain their paramount role in the system (and make a bit of money too) by being the arbiters of what fits into which pigeon-hole. This tendency has prevented India from developing rapidly.

Is there any icing (or chocolate) on this barfi? Since the 1991 reforms India has, in general, been growing faster than rival Pakistan. But Indian per capita income crossed Pakistan’s only about a decade ago; even today it is only 15% above Pakistan’s. India is 141st and Pakistan 147th among 186 countries in terms of per capita income – this is hardly a great lead, particularly given Pakistan’s dire (and self-inflicted) security situation.

Given 70 years of bad history between India and Pakistan, which nobody has been able to resolve so far, the best solution may simply be if the Indian economy does way better than Pakistan’s – in a manner which will make the fruits of cooperation evident even to Pakistani generals (who, after all, have large business interests of their own).

Of course, China is a complicating factor here as it is likely to get in the way of any India-Pakistan rapprochement. But that makes it even more imperative for India to succeed, because China worships GDP growth, and a large part of the reason China looks down on India and refuses to take its concerns seriously is how far ahead it is of India in economic terms."
Stand firm: Prepare for a long haul with China on Doklam,"Even though there are some signs that the India-China standoff in Doklam is thawing on the ground, Beijing is keeping up its strident rhetoric. In its latest tirade, China warned India of “serious consequences” if the latter did not pull back its troops from the contested area in the India-China-Bhutan trijunction region. To its full credit, New Delhi has been firm that Doklam is Bhutanese territory and Beijing’s road building activity there is in clear violation of the 2012 agreement that stipulates trijunction boundary points are to be determined through mutual consultations. Plus, New Delhi has been clear that both sides should withdraw troops from the area simultaneously.

It’s also commendable that instead of matching Beijing’s vitriol, New Delhi has been calm yet firm on Doklam. This sends out a clear message to China that it can’t expect to quietly nibble away at others’ territory. Besides, India has security obligations with respect to Bhutan and strategic sensitivities of its own vis-à-vis Doklam. Hence, Chinese unilateralism can’t be the last word on the matter. However, having ratcheted up the matter, Beijing finds itself painted into a corner. With an important Chinese Communist Party congress coming up later in the year, Beijing is unlikely to retreat from the standoff any time soon.

Given this scenario, New Delhi should prepare for the long haul in Doklam and wait things out. As far as overall India-China relations are concerned, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has stated that India’s roadmap is peace and that Chinese investments in India have gone up in a big way. This is a subtle hint to Beijing that it stands to lose the most in a trade war, as it runs a $51 billion surplus with India currently."
"Facebook's Language Translation Tools Are Now Fully Powered by AI, And The Results Are Amazing","Whenever you see a post that’s in a language other than your own on Facebook, you likely don’t even realise what it is. What you might instead occasionally see is a post with seemingly bad grammar, until you notice the hyperlinked text at the bottom that tells you it was translated by Facebook. And that little feature just reached a pretty amazing milestone.

Right now, Facebook is auto translating posts using only neural networks. The social media platform carries out some 4.5 billion translations everyday, but the earlier system used to have simpler phrase-based machine translation tools. Now, the company has announced it’s switched to a more advanced system.

“Creating seamless, highly accurate translation experiences for the 2 billion people who use Facebook is difficult,” the company said in a blog post. “We need to account for context, slang, typos, abbreviations, and intent simultaneously.” The major difference in the new system is how it goes about translating sentences. The phrase-based model would essentially translate statements word by word, giving you the garbled text you’ve likely come across before. The new tools instead uses AI to consider whole sentences at a time, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), allowing for context and other factors.

And the results are pretty clear. Just look at these two comparisons of translations by the old and new models.

“With the new system, we saw an average relative increase of 11 percent in BLEU — a widely used metric for judging the accuracy of machine translation — across all languages compared with the phrase-based systems,” the company said.

“Neural networks open up many future development paths related to adding further context, such as a photo accompanying the text of a post, to create better translations.We are also starting to explore multilingual models that can translate many different language directions.”

Bangladesh to focus all energies on training ahead of Australia challenge

Bangladesh cricket team will switch their attention to an intense training session as they head to Chittagong for a grueling one week program, that starts on Saturday (August 5).

Bangladesh had started their preparation camp from June 10 for the two-match Test series against Australia at home, through demanding fitness program sessions to help them increase their strength and endurance. Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha is now looking forward to put his emphasis on developing cricketing skills as the hosts strive to be fully equipped as they face Australia during the Test series to be played in Dhaka and Chittagong.

The camp at port city (Chittagong) is expected to be lively with the cricketers are expected to come up with a more determined approach after the long standing pay dispute between players and Cricket Australia reached a resolution on Thursday.

Chief selector Minhajul Abedin told Cricbuzz on Thursday that he feels players need to pick their momentum when they travel for the one-week program and more importantly when they play in a three-day match. ""I think the match is important to get back into the rhythm as they need to play longer-version cricket with a competitive mind set.

""We are excited that Australia is coming because playing Test match against them will always be something to cherish for every international cricketer,"" he added. ""They are one of the most competitive Test nations and they won't let us take an inch of advantage without making us sweat. But we are focusing to look at our own strength rather than thinking about our opponents,"" said the former skipper, who recently had his contract extended by the BCB for another year after completing his tenure that ran till June 2017.

""We should be looking to get the most out of the three-day match as by doing well over there you are expected to gain confidence and chances are high you will also carry that confidence when you take on the visitors,"" Abedin said.

The training program in Chittagong is expected to comprise of a high intensity session on the first day followed by a lighter session on the second, before going back to high intensity again.

Tuesday is expected to be a leisure day but when they take the field for the three-day match on Wednesday, the team management expects high intensity from the cricketers based in the camp.

Following this, Bangladesh will have a specific training session in a bid to prepare for their fixtures against Australia. Also, according to insiders, there is a possibility that former Australia legspinner Stuart MacGill might join them at some point when they resume their training at Dhaka.

For the time being though, Hathurusingha will oversee their slow bowlers and would be expected to bring his own experiences along side drawing important notes from his time spent while working with Sri Lankan ace spinner Rangana Herath.

On the other hand, Courtney Walsh will be working with the fast bowlers while newly appointed batting consultant Mark O'Niell will be busy chalking out his plans with the squad.

Australia are scheduled to arrive on August 18 for a two-Test series with the first Test slated to start on August 27 at the Shere-e-Bangla Stadium. The second Test will be played at Chittagong's Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium from September 4.

Those who sow Hindu terror will reap Muslim terror,"Prime Minister Modi and his partymen wax eloquent about the need to tackle and end terrorism. But what exactly is terrorism? The dictionary definition is “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims”.

Going by this definition, the lynch mobs that beat up and kill people suspected of carrying beef are terrorists. So too are Muslim lynch mobs killing policemen in Kashmir. All these lynch mobs are unlawful, use violence against civilians, and have religio-political goals. They fit the definition of “terrorist” like a glove.

Many in the BJP will not agree: they would like to say that Hindu sentiments have been hurt and anti-beef violence is an understandable though not entirely warranted reaction. The Hurriyat in Kashmir will also shed crocodile tears for the killed policemen but say the mob violence must be seen in the context of Indian military repression. Such excuses are as hollow and cruel as those given by al-Qaida or ISIS for their misdeeds.

The murder of 15-year-old Junaid Khan, for the crime of simply being a Muslim, has been condemned — after a typical long pause that will not discourage mobs — by Modi. Many of his ministers have also issued condemnations. Yet the lynch mobs have not appeared out of a vacuum: they have grown in a socio-political climate created by three years of BJP rule.

A deadly mix of communalism and ultra-nationalism has stirred communal passions despite an absence of major riots. One more Muslim was killed by gau rakshaks in Jharkhand after Modi’s call for peace, showing how difficult it is to put the genie back into the bottle.

My fear is that, unless checked quickly, Hindu terror will be met with Muslim terror, and the country will go up in flames. If the state cannot protect Muslims, there is a high risk that they will devise their own armed squads for protection. Hindu-Muslim terror can escalate with the state a helpless spectator.

Modi wants to sell India to the world as a global manufacturing hub. That will not be possible if India’s fastest growing industry is lynch mobs. Economist Dani Rodrik has shown that the ability to manage internal conflicts is an important determinant of economic growth and prosperity. Since Independence, despite a thousand flaws, India has succeeded in managing its internal conflicts reasonably well, and reaped the corresponding social and economic dividends. That achievement is now in jeopardy.

Fifteen years ago, President Bush of the US congratulated India on having 150 million Muslims but no terrorists. That plaudit was an exaggeration, yet it was not unearned. Given the strident rise of militant Islam across the world since 2001, the moderation of India’s Muslims stood out. That moderation owed a lot to strenuous political efforts to check majoritarian violence and persuade minorities that India was their land too. Alas, the rise of lynch mobs could signal the coming end of that phase.

Across the West, small Muslim terrorist groups (mostly homegrown) are wreaking havoc. They do not need financing or encouragement from ISIS or other foreign agencies: the expertise and knowledge for making bombs are on the internet. Militancy is not typical of Islam: the vast majority of Muslims in the West, as in India, are law-abiding citizens who condemn terrorism. Nevertheless, militants have become a menace in countries with just a few million Muslims.

India now has a Muslim population of 180 million. Even if 0.01% of these Muslims turn militant, that will guarantee havoc. And if 0.01% of Hindus interpret the violence of 0.01% of Muslims as a reason to bash all Muslims, communal terror can ratchet up. Even if 99.99% of both communities are against hate crimes, that will not save the situation, unless the sternest action is taken to halt vigilante groups.

Dawood Ibrahim’s bomb blasts in Mumbai did not occur in a vacuum.

They were a reaction to the anti-Muslim riots that followed the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and the Shiv Sena’s maha-aarti riots of January 1993. Thirteen bomb blasts hit prominent locations including the Shiv Sena’s headquarters. Fortunately, violence did not ratchet up further, and communal tempers gradually eased.

If Hindu-Muslim terror escalates today, it will not easily be doused. I fear that those who sow Hindu violence will reap Muslim violence and vice versa, in a vicious spiral."

Bengaluru franchise returns to Karnataka Premier League,"KPL 2017

Bengaluru franchise returns to Karnataka Premier League

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Fri, 04 Aug, 2017, 09:55 AM

The Bengaluru franchise has marked its return to the Karnataka Premier League, albeit with new owners. Having been a part of the tournament in the first two seasons, the Bengaluru-based team had pulled out ahead of the 2014 season. Nonetheless, Kalyani Motors - city's car dealers - have bought the team for the sixth edition of the tournament, and will be playing under the team name Kalyani Blasters Bengaluru.

Sudhakar Rao, Karnataka State Cricket Association's secretary, said they were delighted by the return of the Bengaluru franchise and hoped that they would get adequate support from the fans in the city.

""The capital city has always loved its cricket, and congratulations to Kalyani Motors for winning the bid of the franchise,"" he said. ""We are sure the fans from Bengaluru are eagerly awaiting to catch the action live.""

Karun Nair-led Mangalore United and Rockstars, a team that included film and television stars, apart from some former cricketers, won't be a part of the upcoming edition of the KPL. All the six other teams - Bijapur Bulls, Belagavi Panthers, Bellary Tuskers, Hubli Tigers, Mysuru Warriors and Namma Shivamogga have retained their franchise rights for the next five years.

KSCA has successfully managed to conduct five seasons of KPL, more than any other state association in the country. And the success of the tournament has eventually translated into the success of their players. Not only has it helped unearth talents such as KC Cariappa, Shivil Kaushik, J Suchith and Kishore Kamath, but has also resulted in Karnataka producing most number of players to have played in the Indian Premier League.

It is a fact that hasn't missed too many eyes, and Sanjay Desai, the KSCA president, hopes that KPL will continue to help enrich cricket in the state and bring talented cricketers to the notice of IPL scouts.

""Over the years, the tournament has helped many young cricketers in Karnataka reach greater heights, and this time, with a revamped set-up, it will further help up-and-coming cricketers in the state and provide a platform for further improvement of Karnataka cricket,"" Desai said.

The season is set to kick-start in September at the M Chinnswamy Stadium. Apart from Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hubli will be the other venues where the KPL matches will be hosted. Before the start of the season, fresh auctions will be held on August 6 with all the players set to go into the auction pool.

"Meet Qudsiya Altaf, Who Is Inspiring Stone Pelters In Kashmir To Kick The Ball Instead","Not far from the Friday rush at the Hazratbal shrine, Qudsiya Altaf, 23, adjusts her bright red cap on the lush green fields of Kashmir University. With six footballs at her pair of shuffling soccer cleats, she rattles off names as she essays the kicks.

facebook

""Haider, Ilyas, Faizan, yahan aajao beta. Thoda gap rakho. Warm up. Fir at least five times pass karo,"" Qudsia says, almost perfunctorily. That has been her routine between 3:30pm to 6:30pm everyday for the past few months.

Last year, when the valley was teeming with protesters over clashes between security forces and stone pelters following Burhani Wani's killing , Qudsia left her civil engineering dream to do her bit: apply salve on a distressed people.

facebook

She then enrolled at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala to train herself as a football coach, a sport she has loved and played since 2007. With a regret that she could never represent India despite playing at district and state levels, Qudsia now wants to take her football team to an international soccer event.

""My dream is to see that these boys represent India at international events. I want to wean them away from guns, stone pelting, drugs and smoking. There's a bright chance for them to make their country proud,"" Qudsia tells TOI.

There were at least three dozen stone pelters who had flocked to her in the initial days.

""They are all good and reformed people who come to me now. They want to do well for India,"" she said.

facebook

She has decided to keep her academic pursuits with another bachelors degree in interior designing, and is thrilled with her new job as a coach at J&K State Sports Council.

As part of her new sports policy, chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has taken Qudsia as football coach for under-14 and under-17 for girls and boys. Since April this year, she is being paid 5,000 per month as a coach.

Qudsia is part of 198 such coaches for different sports such as athletics, hockey, volleyball, basketball, being recruited as part of agreement between the state government and the Centre under Prime Minister's special package of Khelo India programme.

facebook

Seeing Altaf's success, the sports council has identified 200 stone pelters and decided to teach them football on local playgrounds.

Being a girl, Qudsia knows the perils of breaking the glass ceiling. But she is ready to take on the challenges. She shrugs off comments from orthodox Muslims over hijab or her t-shirt and arm bands.

""I am a disciplined coach. I am glad that my father, who taught me mountaineering, has fully supported me. I will fulfil my responsibilities. I speak to these young footballers strictly in Urdu or English. They respect me and win rewards when they play good or win local championships,"" Qudsia said.

Tata Group May Sell Its Telecom Assets To Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio,"India's largest conglomerate Tata Group has explored selling its struggling telecom and related assets to the country's most valued company Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) even as Bharti Airtel remains a strong contender to acquire them.

bccl

While talks with RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's disruptive telecom venture Reliance Jio may not progress, it assumes significance for being the first such deal talk between the country's two corporate Goliaths emerging from the cold war of the past.

The two groups haven't had much business ties in the past and even restricted recruiting employees from each other. The last decade's telecom battles saw Tatas and Ambanis pitched on opposite sides.

bccl/representational image

This started changing with Tata Trusts and Reliance Foundation collaborating in areas such as high-speed connectivity and cancer care. More recently, Tata bagged the Jamshedpur franchise of Indian Super League — a men's professional football league co-managed by RIL.

""It's credible to say both Jio and Tata Tele have explored options, but risky to believe it would make progress,"" said a person familiar with the matter. The Indian telecom industry is gripped by consolidation moves — three deals have been announced in the first half of the current calendar — as the Jio onslaught has hit the bottom-lines of competitors hard.

representational image

New Tata chairman N Chandrasekaran is working on a time-bound plan to sort out the telecom mess, and has asked his deal-makers to explore all options. In June this year, TOI quoted UK research firm CCS Insight to first report that M&A experts were betting on Bharti Airtel acquiring Tata Tele.

Sunil Mittal-led Bharti would be interested in a bundled acquisition of Tata Tele and related assets, especially DTH unit Tata Sky and the world's largest submarine network through Tata Communications.

Tata Group holds a majority stake in Tata Tele and 49% in the listed Tata Communications. It has 60% in Tata Sky with Murdoch and Temasek owning the balance.

bccl/representational image

Anil Ambani's RCom is also learnt to have evinced interest in Tata Tele but its own debt woes and an uncertain merger with Aircel is seen as weighing down on further deal-making.

The Indian telecom industry could become a four operator market by 2020, according to CCS Insight, a global mobile and wireless sector intelligence provider. This envisaged three private operators — Vodafone-Idea, Airtel and Jio — with the state-run BSNL as the fourth-ran.

Chandrasekaran is said to be keen to reduce the over Rs 30,000-crore debt in Tata Tele after Tata Sons bought out Japanese partner NTT DoCoMo. The group's holding company, Tata Sons, recently decided to infuse Rs 12,000 crore in the telecom arm to improve its financial metrics. Tatas have had several discussions to sell off their telecom business in the past, including protracted talks with Vodafone before the UK-based transnational forged a merger with Idea Cellular.

"No case for turf war, CCI and Trai","A turf war is brewing between telecom regulator Trai and the Competition Commission of India, on who should ensure competition in telecom services. This should be avoided. Both should work together, being guided by the overriding objective of serving the interest of the consumer best. Take a hospital. Its administration and its doctors are best placed to decide how it should be run.

But that does not mean the police, whose job is to maintain law and order and prosecute violators, should keep away when irate relatives of patients start beating up hospital staff and smashing furniture. Sectoral regulators should mind sector-specific matters, while the Competition Commission is duty-bound to ensure competition in the working of the sector.

Abuse of market dominance is the key target of competition regulation. Which is the relevant market is the obvious question, for deciding who is dominant. This cannot be assessed without specific knowledge of the sector and its direction of evolution.

In telecom, the markets for content and content delivery will have different contours, depending on whether principles of strict net neutrality are part of the operating framework or not. The markets for voice and data could be separate or identical, depending on the technology deployed.

Only sector-specific knowledge and understanding will allow a regulator to deploy the principles of competition and fair trade to determine appropriate rules of conduct as well as rule-breaking.

The sectoral regulator would understand the sector and its complexities better than the competition regulator; but the competition regulator better understands the overlap between industrial organisation and general economic principles that matter for assessing competition.

The two can and must work in tandem, instead of marking out turfs and snarling at each other.

Ease of entry and exit of operators is the best guarantee against predatory pricing. It stands curtailed by dedicating chunks of spectrum to specific uses and operators. If policy allows true spectrum pooling, markets and competition would get redefined."

Messy GST structure brings back old problems,"The main criticism about the goods and services tax (GST) is the compromises made to bring it about have taken away many of the potential gains. One gain that could have ended is tax arbitrage. But the GST Council’s decision to fix as many seven different tax slabs for goods has made arbitrage inevitable.

In a recent interview to Times of India, Yashwant Sinha, who was finance minister during the earlier NDA administration, pointed out the problem associated with many tax slabs. He said:

“Now, all the problems have been brought back with multiplicity of rates. We had a single rate in service tax but now it is broken into multiple rates. That’s why it is flawed. The return of multiple rates is a step backward and will lead to implementation problems.”

Separately, two reports in Times of India (link, link) highlight problems which have shown up on account of the complicated GST structure. For instance, sweet makers and eateries are either using arbitrage or altering the composition of products to lessen the tax incidence.

Tax arbitrage is the practice of profiting from differences between the way transactions are treated for tax purposes.

When tax arbitrage shows up it means that the focus of the manufacturer is on exploiting the complexity of the tax system instead of offering a consumer the best possible product or service.

Hopefully, GST Council will soon re-visit its tax slabs. There are far too many of them. Even if an ideal GST with just one tax slab is not possible in the near future, the tax slabs can be compressed to three."

China rises; Point is to keep it peaceful,"China’s war games with the Russian navy in the Baltic Sea come on the heels of China opening an extraterritorial base in Djibouti, its test run of an indigenous aircraft carrier and its deployment of world-class destroyers.

Western powers acknowledge China’s rise as a world power and seek its integration into stability-inducing sharing of responsibility such as providing maritime security along the major sea lanes. This is no cause for alarm for India or other countries in the Asia-Pacific. Nor is it a cause for cheer. India simply has to find ways to keep China’s rise peaceful.

For a while, the US and China shared an idyll some dubbed the G2. This new great-power relationship made countries in the Asia-Pacific uncomfortable. As with his Russian counterpart, Xi Jinping’s vision for his country includes the restoration of past glory. That and the more mundane need to deploy unutilised industrial capacity and excess savings underlie President Xi’s signature One Belt, One Road initiative.

Past US administrations sought to check and balance China’s runaway ambitions — by diverse means such as removing western curbs on India’s strategic capacity, via the nuclear deal, and the Trans Pacific Partnership that sought to set the rules of new economic engagement without China’s participation. But President Donald Trump’s America-First bluster has left the field open for China and pushed Europe, the UK and Turkey towards it.

China has good relations with Russia, on the surface, but tensions ripple below. India must rebuild its once-close ties with Russia and put new vigour in relations with Iran and Europe, instead of getting lost in the exertions of Acting East. Countering China will require India to build up its own strategic capacity, leveraging its huge market to the hilt."

No, it is not bizarre because both were men, because of the reason behind the wedding... to please rain gods.

ANI

Residents of Musakhedi area in Indore were in for a surprise on Thursday when two men, dressed in traditional wedding attire, married each other in front of a large crowd of relatives to appease the rain gods.

There was a proper baraat and the usual dancing to Bollywood numbers as the marriage possession passed through the main roads of the locality. The wedding was solemnised in Hindu tradition by a priest, while Sakaram Ahirwar and Rakesh Adjan performed the rituals and took the saat phere of the hawan kund, even as their wives and children looked on.

ANI

""There was no bride. Both Sakaram and Rakesh were grooms in this marriage. They tied the knot as a gesture to draw Indradev's attention for good rain on Indore,"" said organiser Ramesh Singh Tomar.

ANI

Sakaram and Rakesh are labourers who work for Tomar, a water supplier. Tomar pointed out that Indians have taken to western culture and same sex marriages and live-in relationship are now a common thing. ""It gave me the idea of performing a marriage between two men as a gesture to please the gods for rainfall,"" he said.

And apparently the wedding caught the attention of the rain god!

It is reported that monsoon, which had bypassed Indore for the past few days, showered its bounty just as the marriage was being solemnised.

While this is the first time a homosexual wedding to please rain gods have been reported, in the past people have done everything from frog weddings to dog weddings to please rain gods."
11 Underrated Lines From Movies That Explain How Heartbreaks Actually Make You Feel,"Cinema is a beautiful form of craft. The way in which filmmakers try to depict pain and love through their cinema is more than beautiful. No matter if a film ends up doing well or not, sometimes the songs and scenes stay intact in our memories for a long time.

For instance, the scene in Rockstar when Heer hugs Jordan's pullover and cries.

The pain in Heer's eyes and Rahman's music made that moment freeze in our hearts forever. Films have the rare magic of making you feel that you're not alone. Everyone goes through similar situations in life and films and the characters give us sweet reassurances on the same.

The climax of Kal Ho Naa Ho made us realize that not all endings are bitter. You move on in life and keep the memories of that person intact. Heartbreaks are not always about breakups.

Dharma Productions

Sometimes, losing a friend causes as much pain too. When it comes to pain and heartbreaks, films surely have bowled us over with the most honest and unadulterated scenes. Recalling some of those, here are 11 of our favorite and most underrated lines that made us realise how pain and heartbreaks actually make us feel. Read on.

This guy's poem on manning up takes us on a touching ride of bygones, that is too close to reality. He forces us to reminisce about how our fathers, brothers, and sons have been asked to man up because some things are just not for them.

The poet has put down his emotions and years of struggle in this beautiful composition. Check it out.

We don't need feminism as much as we need equality. All of us should be an egalitarian, period.

Why Your Clothes Can Increase Your Chances Of Infecting A Urinary Tract Infection,"The rainy season may bring with it cooler weather and a reason to switch off your air conditioners. But experts suggest that it also increases your chances of developing a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI); especially if you are a woman, which makes you susceptible. Rain and humidity make for a perfect breeding ground for bacterial growth, leading to infection. Clothing such as figure-hugging jeans and other tight clothing further increases chances of developing a UTI.

Doctors say that one in five women suffer from UTI at least once in their lifetime. The risk prevails right from birth—paediatricians often advise parents to look out for their baby girls from contracting UTI.

""In women, the urethra is shorter than in men and is closer to the anal opening. So they are more prone to infections,"" urologist Jaswant Patil said. Improper cleaning techniques and exposure in an unhygienic swimming pool can increase chances of infection, he added.

Gynaecologist Priti Vyas said chances of UTI increase with advancing age. ""More women than men suffer from UTI and the numbers do not neutralise with age. In fact, as women reach their peri-menopausal and menopausal stage, their estrogen levels in the vagina dips, thereby making the urethra more prone to catching urinary tract infection,"" Vyas told this correspondent.

Similarly, lower estrogen levels in adolescents make baby girls more susceptible to such infections.

Clothes can also play a big role in making for a perfect breeding ground for infections. Gynaecologist Ranjana Das said that tight clothing that traps moisture increases chances of UTI.

""We see a lot of young college-going girls complaining of UTI. Wearing tight-fitting jeans that go unwashed for days is a big culprit because it does not allow ventilation and makes a conducive environment for bacterial growth. Using unclean washrooms is another reason,"" the doctor said.

Avoiding public washrooms may not be possible, especially while travelling or at work. Even so, a lot of people, especially women, hold their urine for a long time when faced with the prospect of using public loos. This, Vyas said, also leads to UTI. Hence many people are now opting to carry toilet seat sanitizers.

Vikas Bagaria and his wife Srijana, co-founders of one such product, PeeSafe, said that they realised its need after Srijana was hospitalised with a high-grade fever and acute UTI while on a road-trip.

""We had to cut-short the road-trip in Rajkot and fly back to Delhi where Srijana was hospitalised. It was then she thought of a product that would keep women safe while using public washrooms,"" Vikas said. They discussed the idea, and he finally came up with the product that is now exported to different countries like Australia, Nigeria, Kenya and Singapore.

Coming back to clothing, Patil also said that tight clothes ""compromise blood circulation which leads to lowering of local immunity and makes one prone to infections"". ""Women with menstrual problems are more prone and should be cautious,"" he added.

Nylon undergarments should also be avoided.

To tackle the problem or keep risk at bay, doctors advise consumption of plenty of fluids—although one may not feel as thirsty during the monsoon—and alkaline food like fruits, vegetables and legumes. In hot and humid weather, the urine becomes more acidic and concentrated, and therefore chances of inflammatory UTI and then secondary infection spikes, which fluids can help avoid.

Vyas also has a word of advice against certain products. ""Female hygiene sprays, scented douches and scented bath products can sometimes cause severe inflammation and irritation; so they should be avoided,"" she said.

Ties that bind: Rakhi doesn’t work if made compulsory,"In a new twist on an old tradition, the Daman and Diu administration asked all its female employees to bring rakhis and tie them on their male colleagues’ wrists. While a rakhi often comes in handy for north Indian women in schools, colleges and workplaces to friendzone men and scotch any romantic interest, this may be the first time that it has become a matter of official fiat. The order was quickly withdrawn after protests, but that it even occurred to the officials of the Union territory administered by the home ministry, is telling.

In their own defence, the officials said they were doing it to spread ‘brotherhood’. But why is it the administration’s problem to enforce any relationship at all between professional peers? Rakshabandhan is a sweet festival, as a reminder of sibling bonds. But it does rest on the patriarchal premise that men protect their sisters, who shower them with sweets in exchange for their own survival. Even the friendzoning with rakhis is a troubling phenomeon – it’s a band of placation, for a culture where a woman’s consent and refusal are not valued.

But whether or not one approves, the tradition is deeply meaningful in north India. Ultimately, it is for those who participate in it to argue, accept, or revise it. But meanwhile, an office of the government, where men and women work as equals, has no business injecting these skewed “relationships” into the workplace."
Proud Moment For Sardara Singh And Devendra Jhajharia As They’re Recommended For Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna,"Devendra Jhajharia today became the first paralympian to be recommended for India's highest sporting honour -- the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna -- along with celebrated former hockey captain Sardar Singh.

Javelin thrower Jhajharia, the first Indian to win two Paralympic gold medals, was the first choice of the awards selection committee headed by Justice (Retd) C K Thakkar.

AFP

The committee has picked 31-year-old midfielder Sardar as its second nominee for the top honour and has suggested that both Jhajharia and Sardar be considered for the award jointly.

The 36-year-old Jhajharia's two gold medals came in the 2004 Athens Games and last year's Rio Paralympics and he set new world records on both the occasions. He also won a gold medal at the 2013 World Championships.

Sardar, on the other hand, has been a constant in India's fast-improving standing in international hockey. The 31-year-old, regarded as one of the ace midfielders in the world, became the youngest player to captain the Indian hockey team when he led the side at the 2008 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.

A recipient of the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award of India in 2015, Sardar has two Asian Games medals -- gold in 2014 Incheon and bronze in 2010 Guangzhou. He also has two Commonwealth Games silver medals and was named in the International Hockey Federation's All-Star team twice in 2010, 2011.

""My hard work for the last 15-20 years has paid off. It is the biggest of all sporting honours and the credit for that goes to my teammates because without them I couldn't have achieved what I have,"" Sardar said.

Sardar's name became a topic of debate during the meeting today due to the sexual harassment allegation levelled against him by a Indian-origin British hockey player. However, his sporting achievements were hard to ignore for the committee.

Whether both Sardar and Jhajharia get the award or either of the two is picked, would be decided by the Sports Ministry in the next few days.

The 29-year-old Pujara scored the maximum runs for India in a single season last year. He tallied more than 1350 runs, surpassing even skipper Virat Kohli. Mariyappan had won the men's high jump (F46) gold medal at the Rio Olympics. Bhati, on the other hand, had claimed a silver in the same event. Golfer Chawrasia had won back-to-back Indian Open titles in 2016 and this year. Khel Ratna recommendations: Devendra Jhajharia (Para- Athlete) and Sardar Singh (Hockey).

Microsoft Is Working With Telangana Government To Spot Eye Defects In Children Using AI,"Tech giant Microsoft is tying up with the Telangana state government, using its artificial Intelligence-based platform to screen children for eye defects.

The two parties had signed an MoU in November last year, to use Microsoft’s cloud technology to drive citizen services and digital inclusion. This latest effort is a pilot project to better the health screening program of the National Health Mission.

MINE, the Microsoft Intelligent Network for Eyecare platform being used, is a global collaboration between eye care providers, researchers and academic institutions that trains AI to recognise scans of eyes that show fixable defects, as wells as to pick out markers for preventable future blindness. The AI is trained by teaching it what the ideal healthy eye looks like, as well as specifically training it to look for certain defects by the way they show up on lateral scans.

“We are pleased to announce that Telangana will be the first state in India to bring AI in public health screening and we are excited about how technology has the potential to make great social impact.With the adoption of cloud-based advanced analytics, we see a huge potential for improving the healthcare of our young citizens,” KT Rama Rao, Telangana’s IT minister said.

South Africa nose ahead on compelling opening day in Manchester

• Last updated on Sat, 05 Aug, 2017, 01:16 AM Rob Johnston in Manchester

This was a day of proper Test cricket at Old Trafford, attritional, hard-fought and compelling. Ben Stokes's dismissal, brilliantly bowled by Kasigo Rabada just before the close, tilted the day in South Africa's favour. With a bit more luck and had they taken their chances, the visitors could have had a truly excellent day.

As it is, they will be happy with the six wickets they ended up with after both Vernon Philander and Chris Morris were ruled out of the match with back injuries. Philander, in particular, would have been a handful in conditions tailor made to seam and swing bowling but Duane Olivier stepped in manfully to finish with 2 for 72 from 19 overs. With England 260 for 6 at the close, much is riding on the first session tomorrow.

It was an impressive performance from South Africa's four-man attack and in particular from left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj who conceded less than two runs an over from his marathon 29-over effort. He provided Faf du Plessis with great control from the Statham End and allowed him to rotate the three seamers at the other. Had Maharaj gone round the park, South Africa's attack would have been hugely exposed.

England's batting never really got going despite all of the top seven reaching double figures. Ben Stokes top scored with 58 while Joe Root made 52, the tenth consecutive Test in which he has scored at least a half-century. For the rest, it was a case of what might have been. Alastair Cook, Tom Westley and Dawid Malan will all look back with regret at poor shots while Keaton Jennings was dismissed by a good piece of bowling from Olivier.

Were it not for a partnership of 65 in 132 balls between Stokes and Jonny Bairstow, England would have been in real trouble after Root won the toss and elected to bat on a surface which looked before the game started as if it had plenty of moisture left in it. So it proved.

Jennings was the first man to go for 17 - another failure in the second innings will surely see him dropped for the first Test against the West Indies - but should have been dismissed on four when Rabada dropped a caught and bowled chance. The ball had ballooned up off a combination of Jennings' inside edge and pad but Rabada let the ball slip through his hands as he dived to take the catch.

The South Africans were making the new ball swing and move off the seam at will, although they perhaps bowled slightly too short for the first hour. Tom Westley and Alastair Cook put on 50 for the second wicket but it was hard going. Westley took 27 balls to score his first boundary and England had only made 67 by lunch. Nevertheless, it was a good effort by the home side on a tricky surface and with an outfield slowed by heavy rain over the previous two days.

After lunch, South Africa bowled with extra purpose and, at one stage, bowled five consecutive maidens. Perhaps because of that pressure, Cook played an expansive drive off Maharaj and was caught behind for 46 and two overs later, Westley (29) played away from his body and edged Rabada to Quinton de Kock, who took a stunning one handed diving catch. England had lost two wickets for no runs.

South Africa kept the pressure on Root - he took 16 balls to get off the mark - and Dawid Malan in the most concerted spell of the day. Rabada bowled a seven-over spell in the afternoon session which tested Root to his limits, the England batsman being beaten often and nearly chopping on to his stumps, as the South African found a good length and some added pace.

Malan, who looked more composed than he had at the Oval, and Root put on 52 for the fourth wicket before the former edged the impressive Morne Morkel to Faf du Plessis at second slip just before Tea. It was a poor shot and Malan knew it, smashing his bat in to the turf a couple of times as he walked off and it left England tottering on 147 for 4 at the interval.

Root should have been out as soon as play resumed, as Morkel, who bowled far better than his one wicket suggests, found his edge from a good length ball which nipped away from England's captain. De Kock motioned to go for the catch but in the end left it and the ball sailed away for four runs. Two runs later, Root had passed 5000 in Tests, becoming the third youngest player to the reach the landmark behind Sachin Tendulkar and Cook.

Luckily for de Kock, his error only cost South Africa 12 runs as Root, needlessly shuffling across his stumps, missed a straight, full ball from Olivier to be out for LBW for 52. As ever, it was Stokes who saved the day for England, scoring his eleventh Test half-century. He looked the most fluent player on show and despite some luck - Morkel passed his edge a number of times with the second new ball and he flailed the same bowler through a vacant third slip area - saw England to a decent score by the close.

Stokes' partnership with Bairstow could have been ended in its infancy if England's wicket-keeper had been given out caught off Maharaj when he had just four. With the batsman playing defensively, the ball took Bairstow's inside edge on to his pad and ricocheted to Dean Elgar at first slip, who dived forward to take the ball. Replays were inconclusive and the batsman got the benefit of the doubt but it was, in all likelihood, out.

Bairstow continued on and was in place to face the second new ball which was taken in the final session. Morkel and Rabada, who finished with 2 for 52, beat Bairstow, who finished unbeaten on 33, and Stokes with regularity as they searched for the wicket which would give them the advantage. It duly came as Stokes's stumps were rearranged by a brilliant yorker from Rabada which gave South Africa the spoils of an absorbing day's Test cricket.

Brief scores: South Africa 260/6 (Ben Stokes 58, Joe Root 52; Kagiso Rabada 2-52) vs England

"What modi can do next: Government looks unassailable now, undertake bold policy moves to transform India","Rare is the government that is stronger when nearly two-thirds into its term than at the start. Yet, few would deny that is the case with the Modi government today, especially after the coup in Bihar last week, when it weaned back into its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) the redoubtable Nitish Kumar.

By most accounts, this has dealt a body blow to the opposition. What are the implications of this for governance and reform? Not many would bet on this prime minister playing it safe from the current high till the next general elections. That just does not seem to be his style.

There are already substantial changes underway. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is beginning to drag large chunks of the informal economy into the formal one. The increasing use of Aadhaar, and its unparalleled ability to “de-duplicate” beneficiaries, is drastically pruning the leakages in governmental schemes. India is finally getting international acknowledgment of its surge in infrastructure. And, going by Niti Aayog and International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates, the GDP growth rate again leads the world’s large economies.

But the same growth rate today – for argument’s sake, let’s take the IMF’s projected 7.2% and 7.7% for the next two years – no longer creates the same number of jobs it would have a decade or two ago. The nature of the world’s economies has changed, with far more automation and disintermediation than ever before. That remains a fundamental challenge for India.

I have discussed a Universal Basic Income (UBI) in these pages, an idea being championed by many across the world, with a closely watched pilot project in Finland. While the debate on UBI is hotting up in India, it remains a cutting-edge but still untested idea. It deserves encouragement but also critical assessment, including randomised controlled trials.

Meanwhile, there remain many conventional policy options to dramatically boost India’s economy and governance standards. In some ways these are “no brainers”, tried and tested the world over, and brimming with common sense.

Consider just three such reform options. Judicial (including an overhaul of the criminal justice system), Administrative, and Labour are arguably the three most impactful areas, whose restructuring would transform India’s fortunes. In fact, they have all been attempted before, but lacked the political consensus needed to succeed. With the government’s commanding position today, if its key members are persuaded of their utility, consensus is less of a hurdle.

No society can function well if justice is uncertain or delayed. India’s abysmally clogged judicial system, where even heinous crimes can take decades to investigate, prosecute and try, is in desperate need of reform. Besides our judicial system’s woeful impact on social justice, poor contract enforceability is one of the biggest shackles on our economy.

The last attempted judicial reform ended with the Supreme Court’s tragic 2015 overthrow of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), preserving the world’s only self-appointing collegium system. NJAC had been based on UK’s path breaking act, incorporating transparency and checks and balances, and had unanimous political backing.

With that unanimity now lacking, it is unlikely this government will expend political capital on revamping judges’ appointments. Nevertheless, opportunities abound in police, prosecutorial and judicial procedures reform. But some of these, like funding more police hiring, have large cost implications whose benefits take a long time to show up, not exactly ideal for election cycles.

Similarly, the creaky “steel frame” civil service, designed in the 19th century for colonial aims, is at odds with 21st century India’s needs and aspirations. Sure, it has bright people who once pipped millions of others in an exam. But its systemic flaws, including generalists handling specialised domains, job security despite non performance, short tenures at each post, promotions on seniority rather than merit, etc have long been a crippling choke point for the nation.

Earlier prime ministers including Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh had attempted major administrative reforms but were forced to back down. This PM seems to be going about it incrementally, and quietly. The government has started penalising non-performers and, earlier this month, modernised bureaucrats’ appraisal system, including for the first time peer and subordinates’ feedback.

There have also been reports of significantly larger shares of posts usually “reserved” for the premier Indian Administrative Service (IAS) now going to allied services officers. Could this be a precursor to lateral entry from outside the bureaucracy? If yes, that would be excellent, having been recommended repeatedly by experts.

Finally, our counterproductive labour laws act as a massive brake on job creation, especially in manufacturing, which has stagnated at around 16% of GDP for more than three decades. Economists Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya have written that it is impossible to comply with all of India’s approximately 200 labour laws.

Both the Union government as well as a few states have started tinkering with those. But for the magnitude of jobs crisis India faces, this is too little. It requires radical national level reform to significantly boost job creation.

Traditionally, all Indian political parties have relied on unions, making labour reform unachievable. But Modi pushed GST through despite apprehensions among his party’s traditional base of small traders. With his government now looking unassailable, could lightning strike twice?"

Doklam Imbroglio: Sushma Swaraj chiding Rahul Gandhi is unwarranted,"Against the backdrop of the Doklam standoff between India and China, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has criticised Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for meeting Luo Zhaohui, the Chinese ambassador in New Delhi. According to Swaraj, Rahul should have got his facts on the Doklam issue from the government instead of the Chinese envoy. This is a specious line of argument. It is quite normal for ambassadors of foreign nations to meet political leaders from all sides. Further, it is not as if India and China are at war today – may that never happen. Hence, all political leaders are at liberty to meet the Chinese envoy in New Delhi.

In fact, it is Swaraj who is playing politics by projecting Rahul’s meeting in a negative light. Of course, when it comes to foreign relations and sensitive matters like the Doklam standoff government and opposition parties should maintain a common public position while sorting out differences of opinion in private. However, this doesn’t preclude the possibility of opposition parties or interested entities initiating their own channels of communication with representatives of foreign governments. I repeat, India and China are not at war. The Doklam issue is a dispute that can be managed through dialogue.

In fact, given the current scenario, government should encourage more engagement between the Indian and Chinese sides. This will help government get inputs from multiple sources, which in turn will help it formulate appropriate policy. China is our largest neighbour. And it is not Pakistan. It’s in the interest of Asia as a whole that India and China resolve their differences and maintain a cordial, mutually beneficial relationship. For that to happen, distrust and apprehensions between the two countries need to be mitigated. And this will only happen when there is greater engagement between the two sides, both at the political and civil society levels.

So let’s put the Doklam standoff into perspective. Yes, it is a dispute. Yes, it is sensitive matter. Yes, India should safeguard its strategic interests. However, none of this precludes the option of resolving the standoff through dialogue. There are already some signs of a thaw on the ground with indications of troop withdrawal from both sides. Hence, both India and China need to ensure that the Doklam issue isn’t blown out of proportion. The bilateral relationship is too important to be governed by domestic political considerations in New Delhi and Beijing."

Wrong move: Scrapping no-detention policy won’t improve learning outcomes in schools,"The Union Cabinet’s decision to scrap the no-detention policy in schools till Class VIII – a key provision of the Right to Education (RTE) Act – is a backward step. The no-detention policy was instituted to arrest school dropouts, especially among economically marginalised communities. However, last year the Central Advisory Board of Education – the highest body advising the Centre and states on education – passed a resolution to scrap the no-detention policy on the ground that it was leading to lower learning outcomes. But it’s the poor quality of teaching that must be blamed rather than students.

Bringing back year-end examinations for Classes V and VIII and detaining students who fail them won’t improve learning outcomes. It will simply palm off the responsibility of learning to students, letting teachers off the hook. Students from economically well off backgrounds can overcome the pass-fail system through out-of-school tuitions. But this option simply isn’t available to economically disadvantaged students who are clinging to the school system precariously. Hence, a reversal of the no-detention policy in the foundational years of schooling is bound to increase dropouts, casting a shadow on the future of millions of disadvantaged students.

It needs to be recalled that an important aspect of RTE was continuous comprehensive evaluation where teachers were to periodically assess students’ progress without a pass-fail exam. However, this was never implemented properly. In fact, an analysis of RTE over the last two years shows that more emphasis was laid on implementing 25% free seats for economically weaker children in private schools than on upgrading infrastructure or teacher training. This clearly shows that improvement of quality of education continues to get short shrift. Politicians still see education as a tool to disburse patronage rather than a means to uplift the next generation.

It’s precisely this approach that’s behind the caste-based reservation policy, both in higher education and government jobs. But as experience shows, quotas simply initiate a race to the bottom with each community fighting to get a share of the reservation pie. This in turn creates a creamy layer within the disadvantaged communities, perpetuating the cycle of inequality. The real solution to socio-economic deprivation lies in improving quality of and access to education. And that requires making teachers do their job better as well as fixing shortcomings in educational infrastructure and administration. Governments must deliver inclusive education policies that nurture students and keep them in school."

Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing India’s policymakers.

According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are “overexploited.”

A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.

Punjab also happens to be India’s most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.

One way of looking at it is India’s food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjab’s impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjab’s crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.

It is not just quantity where Punjab’s farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.

This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.

The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?

Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."

OK, don’t panic. You can always watch TV. That’s something, what with all these hundreds of channels, all in different languages, and many of them 24×7.

Bloody hell. Where’s the damn TV remote gone? Except they don’t call it a remote anymore, not if it’s a smart TV. Then it’s called a Magic Wand. And the most Magical thing about the Magic Wand is its seeming ability to wave and make itself disappear where you can never find it when you need it the most. So no TV. Now what?

But Musk is wrong about machines running our lives and us being unable to do anything without them. I am doing something without them. Twiddling my thumbs.

"Amid Border Doklam Standoff, China Violated Border In Uttarakhand Barahoti's On July 25","Two days before National Security Advisor Ajit Doval visited Beijing, Chinese soldiers transgressed into Uttarakhand's Barahoti and came into as much as one kilometre of Indian territory, reported Times Now on Monday.

This is the second transgression, coming a little over a month after the June 16 incursion by Chinese troops in Doklam in the Sikkim sector of the India-China border. They violated the border and began construction on a road in the area.

The incursion into Uttarakhand occurred on July 25 at about 9 am. Chinese soldiers transgressed into between 800 metres to 1 kilometer of Indian territory, sources told ANI.

twitter

Last year, also in July, two soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered 200 metres into the Barholi area of Uttarakhand. At the time, then defence minister Manohar Parrikar said the border has not been demarcated and the two sides have a ""different perception"" about it.Therefore, India called the incident one of ""transgression"" and not "" incursion.

Still, this latest report of a transgression doesn't bode well for Sino-Indian relations, coming so close on the heels of Doklam. And National security advisor Doval's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping did not yield any breakthrough that could end the current standoff.

afp/representational image

Relations between New Delhi and Beijing are fraught. China has refused to acknowledge it violated the border. It claims that Indian border troops crossed the boundary line in the Sikkim sector of the China-India boundary. Its intransigence has extended to Beijing insisting on Indian troops withdrawing before the possibility of any talks with New Delhi.

On its part, India has been unyielding in insisting that China is the aggressor. It points to a clear 2012 understanding that China has violated. On June 30, India told China that its attempt to construct a road in the Doklam area in Bhutan will cause a ""significant change of status quo"", is a ""violation of a 2012 understanding"", and will lead to ""serious security implications.""

""On 16 June, a PLA (People's Liberation Army) construction party entered the Doklam area and attempted to construct a road. It is our understanding that a Royal Bhutan Army patrol attempted to dissuade them from this unilateral activity,"" said India on June 30.

Doval met Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials last Friday at the summit of Brics national security advisors in the Chinese capital. It was clear that both India and China want to keep the discussion on the Doklam stand-off restricted to the bilateral area instead of making it an issue requiring the attention of Brics.

ap/representational image

A Chinese analyst told TOI last week, there is little possibility of Xi going back on the demand that Indian troops must withdraw ahead of the celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army on August 1.

""At best, the high level of belligerence can be allowed to taper off, giving leaders enough time to find a solution. But even this is not easy because there are hawkish voices on both sides,"" the Chinese analyst added, requesting anonymity.

China rises; Point is to keep it peaceful,"China’s war games with the Russian navy in the Baltic Sea come on the heels of China opening an extraterritorial base in Djibouti, its test run of an indigenous aircraft carrier and its deployment of world-class destroyers.

Western powers acknowledge China’s rise as a world power and seek its integration into stability-inducing sharing of responsibility such as providing maritime security along the major sea lanes. This is no cause for alarm for India or other countries in the Asia-Pacific. Nor is it a cause for cheer. India simply has to find ways to keep China’s rise peaceful.

For a while, the US and China shared an idyll some dubbed the G2. This new great-power relationship made countries in the Asia-Pacific uncomfortable. As with his Russian counterpart, Xi Jinping’s vision for his country includes the restoration of past glory. That and the more mundane need to deploy unutilised industrial capacity and excess savings underlie President Xi’s signature One Belt, One Road initiative.

Past US administrations sought to check and balance China’s runaway ambitions — by diverse means such as removing western curbs on India’s strategic capacity, via the nuclear deal, and the Trans Pacific Partnership that sought to set the rules of new economic engagement without China’s participation. But President Donald Trump’s America-First bluster has left the field open for China and pushed Europe, the UK and Turkey towards it.

China has good relations with Russia, on the surface, but tensions ripple below. India must rebuild its once-close ties with Russia and put new vigour in relations with Iran and Europe, instead of getting lost in the exertions of Acting East. Countering China will require India to build up its own strategic capacity, leveraging its huge market to the hilt."
Ravichandran Ashwin Spins Out Sri Lanka In Colombo As Virat Kohli's Boys Take Massive 439-Run Lead,"Ravichandran Ashwin proved why is the No. 2 bowler in the world with five wickets on Day 3 of the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo.

AFP

He took 5/69 as the hosts faltered for 183 which means India now lead by a mammoth 439 runs. This is his 26th fifer, second highest among Indians and he is only behind Anil Kumble who has 35

After a solid 54 on Day 2, which saw him complete 2000 Test runs, he continued his good show with the ball to leave the Lankans dazed. Resuming at 50/2, they were in relative comfort at 117/4 when a collapse saw them lose 6 wickets for 66 runs.

AFP

Ashwin is targeting the 300 wicket mark in 55 Tests so that he can break Dennis Lillee's record of the fastest to that milestone (56). He currently has 284 in 51. With Kohli enforcing the follow on, he has the chance to get closer to that mark."
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."

India Will Soon Get Nuclear Submarines That Can Attack China And Pakistan At The Same Time,"India has finally kick-started its ""mother of all underwater defence deals"" after an excruciating 10-year delay, with France, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Spain and Japan being in the fray to build six advanced stealth submarines for an estimated Rs 70,000 crore ($10.9 billion) in collaboration with an Indian shipyard.

bccl/representational image

This conventional submarine programme called Project-75 (India), languishing in politico-bureaucratic apathy, files and committees since it got the government's ""acceptance of necessity"" way back in November 2007, is likely to be the first mega project under the new ""strategic partnership"" policy finalized by the defence ministry in May.

But it's early days yet. The six shipbuilders, Naval Group-DCNS (France), ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (Germany), Rosoboronexport Rubin Design Bureau (Russia), Navantia (Spain), Saab (Sweden) and the Mitsubishi-Kawasaki Heavy Industries combine (Japan), have to first respond to the RFI (request for information) issued to them last week by September 15, say officials.

bccl/representational image

The Navy will then formulate the NSQRs (naval staff qualitative requirements) before the formal RFP (request for proposal) is issued to the six for submitting their technical and commercial bids for evaluation. The Indian shipyard for the strategic partnership with the selected foreign collaborator will be chosen in a parallel process.

""It may take around two years for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-Indian shipyard combine to be down-selected. Moreover, the first new submarine will roll out only seven to eight years after the final contract is inked. But the aim is to fast-track the entire process,"" said a defence ministry official.

bccl/representational image

The Navy wants the six new diesel-electric submarines to have land-attack cruise missiles, air-independent propulsion for greater underwater endurance and the capability to integrate indigenous weapons and sensors as and when they are developed.

""The stress will be on transfer of technology from the OEM and indigenization. The submarines, to be built with indigenous steel, should also be less maintenance-intensive to ensure a better operational cycle with minimal downtime,"" said the official.

As per approved plans, the Navy should have 18 diesel-electric submarines as well as six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs) and four nuclear-powered submarines with long-range nuclear-tipped missiles (SSBNs) for effective deterrence against China and Pakistan, as was earlier reported by TOI.

But the force is grappling with just 13 old conventional submarines, only half of them operational at any given time because at least 10 of them are over 25 years old, apart from two nuclear-powered submarines, INS Arihant (SSBN) and INS Chakra (SSN).

bccl/representational image

The six French Scorpene diesel-electric submarines being built in Mazagon Docks under the Rs 23,652 crore Project-75, after an over four-year delay, will all be delivered by 2021. But by then, many of the 13 existing submarines will be up for retirement despite mid-life upgrades and refits.

While Russia, Germany and France already have submarine-building experience in India, the possibility of Japan also being included as a contender for Project-75 (I) was first reported by TOI in January 2015. Given the personal chemistry and the desire to deepen the bilateral strategic ties between PMs Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe, India had then asked Japan if it was interested in offering its latest 4,200-tonne Soryu-class submarines for Project-75 (India).

But even though Japan has junked its decades old self-imposed arms export embargo, it has little experience in hawking its military products in the global arms market. ""Project-75 (I) may just be the right arena for Japan,"" said an official.

Why the breakdown of consensus in Monetary Policy Committee is good,"The outcome of the sixth meeting of Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee, or MPC, was a surprise. It was not on account of a reduction in the repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks), but on account of the lack of unanimity in the six-member committee.

The first four meetings of MPC resulted in unanimity of decision making. The first sign of diversity of views came in the last meeting held in June. Ravindra H. Dholakia, an external member of MPC, differed and felt that the repo rate should be lowered by half-a-percentage point, which was a larger cut when compared to what the MPC finally chose to do.

He stuck to the position in August.

That leads to the question: what was surprising about the lack of unanimity in August meeting?

Michael Debabrata Patra, executive director in RBI, which makes him the junior most of RBI’s three nominees, differed from the rest of the committee. He wanted to maintain status quo.

It will take a couple of weeks for the minutes of the meeting to be published. But in the meantime it worth looking at why Patra’s position is a positive development.

When there were public debates on the best possible composition of MPC, it was often assumed that RBI’s nominees would vote in the same way. There were arguments that RBI’s nominees were unlikely to publicly differ from the governor on the matter of policy rates.

Patra just did that which can’t be a bad thing when seen in the context of the need for diversity of views in MPC.

It is tempting to second guess Patra’s reasoning based on the minutes of the last MPC. He states that the aim under a flexible inflation targeting framework is to steer the trajectory of inflation towards the target in the medium-term and deal with risks around it.

He seemed to anticipate some of the criticism that would come MPC’s way as he stated that it would not do to change the framework of inflation targeting on the basis of past data or forecast errors of MPC.

It was the equivalent to anticipatory bail as Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor in finance ministry, later tweeted:

“Policymakers should follow real data rather than error prone forecasting models.”

On the basis of the last two MPC meetings, it may be reasonable to say that there is evidence that MPC’s minutes will in future be a more insightful document."

"Tech companies in Israel: Here, startups are really startups","By: Ambi Parameswaran

A recent trip to Israel was an eye-opener. As we went about meeting the tech startups as a part of our study tour, it dawned on me that there was something that was happening in Israel that we are not seeing in India, despite all the hoopla around startups and unicorns.

Israel ranks No. 2 in innovation, according to the World Economic Forum. It produces 1,000 startups a year. The total number of active startups are anywhere between 4,300 and 6,000. Now to the surprises.

None of the 20-plus startups we visited had anything to do with e-commerce. You could say: Israel is a small country, so what are they going to sell and to whom? While Israel has strong links to Silicon Valley in the US and could well be working on e-commerce opportunities to be exploited in that country, we did not meet one.

We kept hearing about the startup pipeline being supplied through the army — which while insisting on army service, isolates the nerds to do its own computer work, only to let them go back to the world of commerce to do their own startups. No wonder cyber security is a hot area for Israeli startups

The incubator ecosystem in Israel is second only to the one in the US. The number of accelerators has grown from one to 186 in just 10 years. The country ranks No. 1in startups per capita.

Israel not only has robust angel-investing and venture-investing systems —including some wonderful crowdfunding organisations — but the ‘exit system’ is equally robust. There were $10 billion worth exits in 2016. In 2017, the total has already hit $17 billion with the acquisition of MobileEye by Intel. (Intel has acquired 30 Israeli startups in the last decade.)

Old age is no sin. Several Israeli startups are by serial entrepreneurs, some in their 50s. I am told that in India, no venture capitalist (VC) will look at you if you have a head full of grey hair. Some of these veterans in Israel we met were ready to admit that they may have gone wrong with their latest enterprise, but with their characteristic chutzpah were ready to sell and start again.

Israeli startups are being built to scale up rapidly. In a sense, they are all looking to sell to US companies who can take their technology and forge ahead in the large growing US market. Finally, in Israel, you can’t confuse startups with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). By definition, a startup is an enterprise that can scale up rapidly, probably by adding a stack of servers, or more space on the cloud.

And all the Israeli startups we met were all focused on breakthrough technology. We heard terms like Edge Computing, Deep Thinking, Augmented Reality, Interactive Handheld Devices, Drone Gaming, Endpoint Security….

I was left wondering if the Indian startup ecosystem is also throwing up such hi-tech companies. So, I sent this innocuous question to a few of my friends who are active in the startup scene here in India: ‘I was in Israel last week and met many startups. I got a feeling that Indian startups are not playing in the high-end tech space at all, unlike the Israeli startups. True?’

I got a range of responses, from ‘Unfortunately, yes. Our ecosystem likes transaction business models. Things that require R&D are not encouraged as valuable businesses’ and ‘The ecosystem of university, government and venture capital for hi-tech startups is fantastic there. The tech stays in Israel, and marketing goes to the US’, to a very terse and telling, ‘Yes. Very True.’

One more thing we learnt: Israelis are not only breeding super intelligent young startups, they are also happy with large families with kids, the larger the better. At least that sounded oddly comforting and familiar.

Teacher Allegedly Strips Two Girl Students Of Class 6 For Scoring Low Marks In An English Test!,"Uttarakhand police have registered a case against a woman school teacher under section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC after parents of two students alleged that their daughter were stripped by the teacher.

The incident was reported from Landaura, 8 km from Roorkee on Tuesday.

The teacher allegedly took the extreme step of public shaming two girls, students of class VI as punishment after they scored low marks in the English test paper.

""Parents of both girls alleged that the teacher first reprimanded their daughters and then took off their shirts in front of the entire class as they had performed poorly in an English test. When the girls reported the incident to their parents, they went to the school and protested against the teacher,"" Superintendent of police (rural) Manikant Mishra said.

""We demand strict action against the school administration for not installing CCTVs in classes and not terminating the teacher for her behaviour,"" parent of one of the students said.

Braham Pal Singh Saini, district education officer (basic), said, ""We have taken cognisance of the incident and asked the school to remove the teacher. We are also issuing an advisory to all schools, asking them to start training courses for teachers on appropriate conduct.""

"No case for turf war, CCI and Trai","A turf war is brewing between telecom regulator Trai and the Competition Commission of India, on who should ensure competition in telecom services. This should be avoided. Both should work together, being guided by the overriding objective of serving the interest of the consumer best. Take a hospital. Its administration and its doctors are best placed to decide how it should be run.

But that does not mean the police, whose job is to maintain law and order and prosecute violators, should keep away when irate relatives of patients start beating up hospital staff and smashing furniture. Sectoral regulators should mind sector-specific matters, while the Competition Commission is duty-bound to ensure competition in the working of the sector.

Abuse of market dominance is the key target of competition regulation. Which is the relevant market is the obvious question, for deciding who is dominant. This cannot be assessed without specific knowledge of the sector and its direction of evolution.

In telecom, the markets for content and content delivery will have different contours, depending on whether principles of strict net neutrality are part of the operating framework or not. The markets for voice and data could be separate or identical, depending on the technology deployed.

Only sector-specific knowledge and understanding will allow a regulator to deploy the principles of competition and fair trade to determine appropriate rules of conduct as well as rule-breaking.

The sectoral regulator would understand the sector and its complexities better than the competition regulator; but the competition regulator better understands the overlap between industrial organisation and general economic principles that matter for assessing competition.

The two can and must work in tandem, instead of marking out turfs and snarling at each other.

Ease of entry and exit of operators is the best guarantee against predatory pricing. It stands curtailed by dedicating chunks of spectrum to specific uses and operators. If policy allows true spectrum pooling, markets and competition would get redefined."

BCCI nominates Pujara, Harmanpreet for Arjuna award

Cheteshwar Pujara, the pillar of Indian Test cricket, and Harmanpreet Kaur, the driving force of India's women's cricket, have been nominated for the Arjuna award by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), according to PTI reports.

""We have sent Cheteshwar and Harmanpreet's name for the Arjuna award. The names have been forwarded to the Ministry of Sports,"" a senior BCCI official informed PTI on Thursday (August 3).

""Both have been exceptional performers during last season and were unanimous choice from our end,"" he added. The BCCI, however, haven't recommended any names for Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the highest sporting honour of the country.

Pujara was the leading run-scorer in Tests since the start of Indian home season and has been pivotal in helping the team achieve mammoth first innings totals. He averages over 70 in 25 innings with six tons and eight half-centuries against his name. He also went past 4,000 Test runs in his 50th Test match, which is the ongoing second Test between India and Sri Lanka.

Harmanpreet Kaur, the India Women's T20I skipper, has been a revelation in the last 18 months. She helped India seal a rare T20I series victory in Australia and had also become the first Indian Women's cricketer to clinch a deal by an overseas T20 franchise when she was picked by Sydney Thunder in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL). She was impressive with the bat during her stay with the franchise.

Needing 2 from the final delivery in ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier 2017 final against South Africa, Harmanpreet held her nerve and pulled off a miraculous win to help India finish on top. The 28-year old also steered India to their first World Cup final since 2005 with a once-in-a-life-time-knock against Australia of an unbeaten 171 that included 20 fours and 7 sixes, which knocked the defending champions out of the tournament.

Tiny ponds used to form in the crevices of kholas then – all dried up now – and young men would clamber up the slippery rocks to take a dip in the cold, clear pools.

The boys, on a break from school, had packed sandwiches and tea in a flask. They were excited about their little excursion. Suddenly a vehicle with CRPF jawans screeched to a halt in front of them and all three were bundled in. An officer asked for information on local leaders active during the agitation for a separate state of Gorkhaland that had erupted with Subhash Ghisingh in 1986. The jawans were cursing and hitting the boys.

One of the kids remembered advice he had been given by elders: if you are caught by CRPF, speak in English. “Sir,” he said in English, “I go to school and live in a hostel. My father is with the SBI. These are my friends and we don’t know the people you are talking about.” The beatings stopped and the officer asked if the statement could be verified. Then he said something that both terrified and relieved the boys. “Run home, don’t turn back. If you do, you will be shot.”

The boys ran and ran, like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. But unlike in the movie, the shackles never really came off. They don’t, if you belong to any of the communities on India’s margins. However hard one tries to integrate, osmosis remains difficult in a country that thwarts its own people.

It is that, apart from a sense of other injustices, which is fuelling the agitation for Gorkhaland this time in the hills of Darjeeling. If there is a difference in the nature of protests from those in the 1980s, it is that hundreds of thousands of young men and women have travelled out of the region in the past decades – some have returned, many have not – and all of them have grown up to ask one question: where do we belong? Where is home?

It is not the Darjeeling of Bengal, where they feel discriminated against, where at the best of times they are left to fend for themselves. The inquiry has become urgent – and articulate – with the new generation not content anymore just to join the army and unquestioningly serve a nation that doesn’t seem to care for or notice them.

The Gorkha, call him Nepalese if you will, has gone beyond the condescending stereotype that has forever defined him. He is a software engineer in Bangalore now, an actor in Mumbai, doctor in Delhi, fashion designer in New York and writer in London. And he’s had enough of it. Today he wants his space in the sun, he demands recognition.

There is another crucial change in the passionate voices coming from the hills. They no more belong to the leaders. The movement has passed into the hands of students, housewives, professionals, senior citizens.

In street meetings and town rallies, warnings openly go out from the public to local legislators and administrators. This time, you will not cheat us or mislead us, they say. You will not make contracts behind our back. In fact, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Bimal Gurung, who snatched the baton from Ghisingh, has begun to look marginalised.

Though it was Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who lit the fire when she said Bengali would be compulsory even in the schools of Darjeeling where a majority speak Nepali – language, she should have known, is an intrinsic part of identity – and Gurung, battling shrinking political space and anti-incumbency, stoked it, the latest round of calls for a Gorkha homeland has taken a life of its own. It hasn’t mattered that BJP, which sent SS Ahluwalia to Parliament from Darjeeling with support from the Morcha, has turned its back on the people, looking as it does to make inroads into Bengal.

The party knows that its endorsement of Gorkhaland may backfire during the next elections, what with Mamata reiterating that she will not allow a division of her beloved state, however far the hills might be from Kolkata – ethnically, culturally, linguistically.

The indefinite bandh in Darjeeling is now its longest ever at 47 days and shows no sign of ending. Smartphone in hand and talking to a diaspora that has spread to every corner of India and the globe, never before has there been such communication of resolve, commitment to cause.

Solidarity videos are being streamed from Hong Kong and Manchester, marches are out in Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and all the 15 million estimated Indian Gorkhas seem to be sharing a common anguish, a hope that the shackles may finally be coming loose, a conviction that Gorkhaland is an idea whose time has come."
"There is no military solution in J&K, separatist finances should have been targeted much earlier","The most ineffective way of fighting your adversary in a hybrid conflict, like the one in Jammu & Kashmir, is to fight it only through the military route. This mostly ensures that you restore temporary order, but mayhem will soon return and often in your own presence.

The scope of hybrid conflict extends to multiple domains. Violence at different levels and different locations keeps the conflict relevant and visible while an adversary delves into other domains silently and effectively. Among these domains are promotion of radical ideology, creation of intense alienation, keeping the organs of government on tenterhooks and incapable of governing, intimidation of government agencies, media and private citizens, gun running and narcotics to sustain finances, and lastly and perhaps most importantly maintaining financial conduits for the unimpeded flow of money into the conflict system.

The invisible elements of hybrid conflict are far more dangerous than the seemingly more potent but largely visible elements such as cannon fodder terrorists. A common question which even some intellectuals ask me is – “why despite killing so many terrorists and losing so many soldiers, is little headway being made in J&K?” This is because, while keeping the army and police engaged in the fight against terrorists and stone throwers, there have been a range of activities taking place under the sponsorship and patronage of a host of other people.

The separatists have been projecting their cause through literature, social media, media patronage, mosque power, direct engagement and creation of structures which can be activated in minutes to respond to diverse situations. The campaign to radicalise Kashmiri society has been a deliberate ploy to empower the mosque and link Pakistan’s chosen path of radical Islam to the Valley’s new ideology.

None of us could stop it because of our intellectual inability to realise what was shaping up around us. In any case India’s security agencies were largely bereft of knowledge on religious ideology when radical Islamists across the border were planning and coordinating activities in the Valley with impunity.

None of the above can be done by separatists with the level of competence they have displayed without adequate financial backing, a truism for any such conflict. Islamic State could survive three years in northern Iraq because of looted finances from the Mosul treasury and revenues of taxation and the oil refinery. Once most of that was spent it was no longer possible to continue in the same mode.

It was, therefore, always a question of evolving our own strategy through ‘whole of government’ approach. Unfortunately the political class could not appreciate what its role was at the operational and strategic level. The problem was their perception that it was a conflict situation and therefore the responsibility of the security forces.

The separatists have far better network and organisational structures than even the army. There are elements in every ‘qasba’ and every town, the intelligence providers, backed by an army of lawyers, treasurers, ideologues, rabble rousers, stone throwers, drug addicts and of course terrorists. All of them survive on the additional income provided by the separatists. There has been enough money coming in to finance a plethora of overground workers, compensate families of terrorists, pay guides at the LoC, safe house owners and stone throwers on an everyday basis.

Money came from foreign sources into legitimate accounts, cash was drawn by cards from accounts opened and existing in Delhi and even more cash was available through gift packets on Pakistan’s national day, at the Pakistan high commission.

With the situation in south Kashmir having drastically changed, the government has finally acted. It is good that both parties of the J&K coalition government have supported the NIA’s initiative with arrest of seven separatist leaders. Details of their financial networks are bound to produce enough incriminating material to ensure that the leadership is sufficiently ineffective for long. Care must be taken to prevent VIP facilities and availability of communications to the leaders, otherwise the entire gamut of operations may be compromised.

Next should be curtailing of mosque power, for which the effective advice of moderate Muslim clerics from rest of India should definitely make a difference. In the interim the army and other security forces must continue their excellent run to prevent the resurgence of gun power in the Valley. The ‘whole of government’ approach must continue."
The fault lies in our stars,"In 1983, Indira Gandhi said corruption was a global phenomenon. Many laughed at the prime minister’s pitiable attempt to defend herself against charges of corruption. But it, indeed, is. No country, region, province or locality is free from corruption, admits eminent journalist N Ram in his brilliant analysis of political corruption in India in Why Scams Are Here To Stay (Published by Aleph, Pages 202, Price Rs 399). Ram says that corruption is a normal, not an abnormal, condition within the political economy of capitalism.

Should the fact that every other country too is corrupt be some consolation for an ordinary Indian?

No, it should not. Although the title of this impeccably produced Aleph book can be a little pessimistic, Ram, who at the helm of The Hindu in 1987 spearheaded the investigation into the Bofors case involving the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, lays out nine proposals to combat corruption by bringing in changes in laws, enforcement capacity, policies, institutions, regulation, vigilance, the private sector, journalism and politics.

Chief among them is action on the legislative front to tackle corporate fraud since corruption, however flagrant or damaging, committed by private individuals and companies cannot be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act (1988). Ram points out that private sector fraud rarely figures in mainstream media but must be recognized as one of the most widely prevalent and toxic forms.

To buttress his argument Ram brings alive Asian Drama: An Inquiry Into The Poverty of Nations, where Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal called attention to the active role of the business world in promoting corruption among politicians and administrators in south Asia.

Ram reminds us that the past decade-and-half has seen a spectacular outbreak of corruption scandals, big-ticket, medium-sized and relatively small. It is an alarming situation as Ram puts it. “With its tentacles spreading to virtually every branch of the Indian state, including the judiciary, and to key sectors of the economy, notably finance, construction, mining, land and real estate, information technology, telecommunications, agriculture and defence, and to the news media, corruption’s salience in India’s political economy and public policy discourse has never been higher.”

Why Scams Are Here To Stay is a must-read for all public-spirited Indian citizens since corruption involves us all. This is a masterly work but written in accessible style. To begin with, Ram discusses the story of corruption and scams in India. Then he addresses the multifariousness of corruption where grand, petty and political corruption gets examined. Significantly he brings his critical gaze into news media corruption and sharp practices involved in it. His next focus is law and enforcement. In a highly educative Section II, Ram examines the history, definitions, and theory of corruption. He then looks at political corruption through a Marxist lens and presents the argument of Prakash Karat, former general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that it is not politicians who are to be blamed for corruption in India but big business. Listen to Karat’s argument. “The fountainhead of corruption is big business and the neo-liberal policies. Interestingly, the political system is getting perverted by big capital. It is the illegal money generated by big business and the corporates which has corrupted the political system and not the other way around. The political system is getting moulded to accommodate the interests of a proliferating capitalism.”

Karat is right. Karat’s theory is an admission of guilt and failure of politics in India. But what, then, is the role of politicians? Shouldn’t politicians be the bulwarks against corruption? And if capitalism is the villain what about socialist China? Ram does not fail to ask Karat that why does China, a socialist country with its socialist market economy have such high levels of corruption, making President and Party General Secretary Xi Jinping take the anti-corruption drive against ‘tigers and flies’-powerful leaders as well as low-ranking cadres-as one of his top political projects?

His two case studies-Bofors scandal and Tamil Nadu’s scientific system of political corruption-warn us about the pitfalls in the battle against corruption. The frequent hijacking of the adjudicative process by defence lawyers and the failure of the judiciary to observe strict timelines, ensures that even if the investigation is independent and efficient, the corrupt in high places cannot be tried and punished within anything like a reasonable time-frame.

Citing the example of Bofors case, Ram points out that what prevailed at the bar of public opinion and politics (V P Singh won the national election and became PM) failed and eventually collapsed at the bar of public prosecution. In Jayalalithaa’s disproportionate asset case the verdict came too late.

Ram rejects the notion that corruption is a mode of moral and social behaviour. For him, the fault lies in India’s capitalist system, which has developed a high degree of monopoly, is enmeshed with international finance capital, is caste-ridden, and coexists with vestiges of semi-feudalism and its mutations. And finally the admission-fault lies also in ourselves. That realization has to dawn on all of us if we are to make any difference."

Grass or no grass, India set to face bowling conundrum

• Last updated on Wed, 02 Aug, 2017, 06:04 PM Vishaal Loganathan in Colombo

Will Harduik Pandya be dropped to accomodate an extra spinner? © AFP

Virat Kohli would have gone to bed a happy captain last night. He had seen the pitch at the Singhalese Sports Club, Colombo - the venue for the second Sri Lanka-India Test - and liked what he saw. The pitch was hard and had an even covering of grass. It seemed a batting beauty that offered little to the bowlers.

The last time India played on such a wicket, they racked up 600 in their first innings, and went on to win the match by 304 runs. Kohli himself notched up a century in the second innings of the Test. An encore looked on the cards, and Kohli would have been pleased.

When India arrived for the practice on the pre-match day, Kohli would've had no reason to believe that the pitch would've changed much. He would not have seen that since morning, ground staff were working hard on the pitch, making sure that almost every blade of grass was removed. He would not have heard or read Dinesh Chandimal saying, just minutes before India's press conference, that the pitch looked dry and would take spin from the second day.

When the Indian team arrived at the ground, the transformation was complete and the pitch was under the hessian. In fact, when one of the journalists asked Kohli about the surface being dry and if there was a possibility of India playing three spinners, the India captain scoffed.

""Surface looks dry? It had a lot of grass on it, so I don't know which wicket you had a look at,"" he said.

Kohli would soon find out the secret under the covers. The pristine batting wicket India had seen 24 hours ago had vanished. Instead there was a dry wicket that would take spin early. It would have led to all sorts of confusion for the captain.

Kohli had just talked up the wicket he'd seen prior to the question about three spinners.

""I had a look at the wicket yesterday, I haven't seen it today yet. Looked pretty nice and hard underneath with good covering of grass. The last time around as well, we thought it was a great wicket for Test cricket. Batsmen had to apply themselves to get runs, bowlers were in the game throughout. It is a wicket that you will get a result on for sure. That excites us, it's something that we look forward to as a team and this is the kind of wicket that we always like to play on, where we have a chance to make an impact on the game throughout. I really enjoyed playing here last time, and I think it's a great wicket for Test cricket,"" he said.

But now, this was a whole new wicket, and India's plans had a spanner in them. They would now have to look at whether they would need to play an extra spinner in place of an allrounder or a pacer. Hardik Pandya had offered the team a lot of balance, but would he play a second seamer's role well enough? That would mean the reverse swing of one of Mohammed Shami or Umesh Yadav, a vital part of India's bowling plans on hard abrasive surfaces, would not be for use. If Hardik is dropped, the extra batting cushion and the x-factor is amiss. India will then play with three spinners, using Kuldeep Yadav as the third, but again questions will be raised about whether they would really need three spinners, when R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, two of the best spinners in the world, are already part of the squad.

The inclusion of an extra batsman would be a tantalising option too. If the track does take oodles of spin, then an extra specialist batsman would shore up the batting side of things. Rohit Sharma, Kohli's calling card for a player who changes games in a session, would be in at six for India.

Another option for India would be to stick to the same bowling combination. The same five bowlers in Umesh, Shami, Pandya, Ashwin and Jadeja were able to get 20 Sri Lankan wickets on a pretty bland surface, and they could still put faith in the side to do that on a spin-friendly wicket.

The sudden change in the pitch would definitely have caught India by surprise. But as the number one Test side in the world, and one that consistently talks about being 'ready and looking forward to new challenges', they should take this in their stride and look to seal the series against Sri Lanka.

One day ago, India's would have dabbled with thoughts about their opening combination. Now that they've seemingly settled that, they will face another phase of uncertainty over their bowling order.

"From tech cos to Everest, her marathon continues","Forty-six-year-old Meerah Rajavel, hailing from Virudhunagar, is probably the only woman from Tamil Nadu who completed a marathon at the Everest Base Camp last year. But that is just one of the feats that make Meerah an inspiring figure for girls in the state. A tech aficionado in a senior position at a US-based company, Meerah, has come a long way from being a small-town girl who was not allowed to study outside, to being a globe-trotting professional, an avid marathoner and a social entrepreneur.

Meerah started running in a bid to socialise with others in her early 30s. So far she has participated in more than 20 marathons, her first being the one at Long Beach, Los Angeles. The Athens Classic Marathon was one that tested her endurance. With a part of the marathon involving an uphill climb, Meerah says she began throwing up midway. “My body was telling me to stop. If I had, the ambulance would have picked me up and the medics wouldn’t have allowed me to continue. But, something within told me to finish it and I ran on,” she says.

For Meerah , running is an addiction. “Human body is a great machine. If you give it time and train it well, it will work the way you want it to. The adrenaline rush and the energy and fitness levels you acquire are by-products but running is the motivation,” she says.



Besides running, Meerah juggles her time between her role as the chief information officer at Forcepoint, a cyber security company in the US and her passion for social entrepreneurship. Her love for computers began when she was in the 11th grade. Studying in a small girls’ school in Virudhunagar, Meerah’s batch would travel to the nearby boy’s college over the weekend to get five minutes in front of a computer. She even convinced a college professor to teach her computer skills.

Determined to study computer science engineering, Meerah was set on Guindy Engineering College (GEC) in Chennai but her parents felt otherwise. “We didn’t want her to be far away. Both of us were working and we had to make sure we could be there if she ever needed us,” says Astamani, her mother.

When her admit card to GEC was received by post, her father kept it away from Meerah. After she cleared the entrance to Thiagarajar College of Engineering at Madurai which was less than an hour away from home, her father showed her the earlier admit card. “I was livid at first. But I knew it was in my best interest,” says Meerah.

Post her engineering, Meerah worked with various companies including Lotus Infotech and Infosys in India and Cisco in the US. “The years in Cisco were formative for my career. In a span of 10 years, I handled roles across sales, finance, engineering and shared services,” she says.

She is also deeply invested in social entrepreneurship. After her mother retired as a school teacher, Meerah set up a fund along with her in Virudhunagar to sponsor the education of underprivileged girls and build a free library. “It is a free of cost and centrally located facility that is accessible to all the girls’ schools. All girls commuting back home have to pass by the library. We have more than 3,000 books that I have sourced from various stores and sales in the US,” she says.

For young girls in small towns who aspire to make it big, Meerah says,” Dream big. Everything is possible when you put your heart and mind to it.”"
Free children from chains: India and the world need a multi-dimensional strategy to stop human trafficking,"Ideas have legs. So do human beings. When ideas are chained, we desecrate the very fundamentals of freedom. When human beings are chained, we desecrate the fundamentals of humanity.

One of the monumental milestones for mankind is the abolition of slavery. But while we have won many decisive wars against slavery and bondage, we haven’t succeeded in completely vanquishing this degrading and dehumanising practice. What is ironic is that the world today has the largest number of slaves at any point of time in history, even medieval or colonial.

Let us remind ourselves of some sobering and deeply disturbing facts. More than 21 million people across the world are victims of trafficking. They are de facto 21st century slaves.

While sexual slavery and forced labour remain the major drivers behind trafficking, shocking new trends have emerged. At least 10 nations have reported that trafficking has been related directly with organ harvesting. This is now a $32 billion a year business according to the UN.

But humanitarian agencies reckon that it has surpassed drugs and arms as the largest criminal business in the world with an annual revenue of $150 billion. Women and children constitute 71% of the victims. How can any civilisation allow this atrocity to continue and flourish?

Another alarming trend is that the line between migration, refugee crisis and trafficking is becoming very thin. It has been consistently noticed that the geographical paths and routes of trafficking bear striking resemblance with those of migration. The increasing scale of both natural and man-made disasters, particularly armed conflicts and civil wars, is creating a whole new generation of refugees who are becoming victims of trafficking gangs. Syria is a stark reminder of this trend.

Clearly, law enforcement agencies in developed countries as well as global bodies tasked to check trafficking need much more coordination and cooperation. Moreover, the international community – by incorporating abolition of trafficking and all other forms of modern slavery in a time bound manner in UN Sustainable Development Goals – has agreed this crime has wider negative implications on economic growth and development. Realisation of these goals requires will, resources and action at national and international levels.

India has not been immune to this global scourge. Official data indicates that close to 20,000 women and children were trafficked in India in 2016 but the real numbers could be far higher. More than 1,00,000 children go missing every year. Almost half of them are never traced. Most of the untraced children become victims of human trafficking, slavery, begging and prostitution rackets.

Since most victims of trafficking belong to poor and marginalised families, hardly anyone, including police personnel, paid much attention to these family tragedies. But a historic Supreme Court judgment of 2013 based on a petition by our movement Bachpan Bachao Andolan has directed the state to act promptly and effectively. Yet, trafficking and slavery continue to flourish in India.

And the stories are tragic. We had rescued 13-year-old Malvika (name changed) from Gurgaon. She was trafficked from a village in West Bengal with promises of good wages. Her life was hell after that. In two consecutive homes where she worked as a domestic help, Malvika was treated like a slave with the employers routinely beating her. In both houses, she was raped repeatedly by drivers.

Malvika is lucky that she was rescued and is back with her family. Hundreds of thousands of victims like her have not been as lucky. What can we do in India to stop the barbarity against young girls like Malvika?

For starters, we need a strong law against trafficking. Despite endless debates and repeated pleas by civil society groups, stringent anti-trafficking laws have not been passed by Parliament. Nor have state governments taken meaningful measures to stop this atrocity. It took almost 19 years for India to ratify the ILO conventions that prohibit the worst forms of child labour. Let us not drive hundreds of thousands of innocent children into cruel and miserable lives of slavery by indulging in such unforgivable delays.

We as citizens too need to play a more proactive role by refusing to keep our eyes and ears closed. We must protest and report cases of suspected trafficking victims in our neighbourhoods. That is a moral imperative. Equally important is the need to target the economic roots behind trafficking. It is states like Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam and Odisha that still witness extreme poverty that report the most cases of trafficking.

Apart from vastly improved awareness and law enforcement, what India needs to deal with trafficking and slavery is economic opportunities. When poor families earn enough to feed themselves, they become less vulnerable to criminal gangs. When incomes of poor families improve, their children go to school instead of seeking work. When children go to school, their chances of being trafficked and sold into slavery diminish dramatically.

For 70 years or so, India has not ensured economic security to a large number of its citizens. Of what help is India becoming an economic superpower if hundreds of millions remain in poverty with their children vulnerable to predatory traffickers?"
Managing the ticketing operations for the FIFA U17 World Cup,"By Joy Bhattacharjya

On the 17th of May, the first major milestone for the FIFA U-17 World Cup was accomplished when Carles Puyol handed over the first ticket to the family of Shibdas Bhaduri, the captain of the legendary Mohun Bagan team that won the IFA Shield. It was exactly 19:11, the year that Bagan won that epic game. It activated one of the most important parts of tournament organisation, the ticketing operations.

On the face of it, ticketing seems the simplest possible operation. Just pick up an old stadium map, find the number of seats available and put them up for sale. It is one of the most complicated operations in both design and execution.

The first major task is the creation of a ticketing manifest – a plan that maps out every seat in the stadium. Now, while existing maps are usually there with the authorities, most are inaccurate.

One big reason is that most Indian stadiums did not originally have bucket seats, so all capacities were judged on a rough basis and assume very little space between people. Most stadiums lose a lot of capacity by converting to safer and infinitely more comfortable bucket seats. Salt Lake will now seat less than half of the estimated 140,000 that watched a Derby match in 1997.

The other issue is that high-quality television coverage involves putting in cameras around the ground, even in places not envisioned thirty years ago.

So all the seats close to or behind that camera platform are also ‘killed’. They also may be structural issues for which a particular stand should not seat more than a certain number of people. After a six-month process and numerous walkthroughs to determine seat kills, the final stadium manifest records the number of seats available.

The next stage is deciding the categories of tickets. The closest tickets to the ground are normally the most coveted in most international football stadiums, but Indian stadiums either have a running track or are also oval shaped to also allow cricket matches. So the lowest level seats don’t always have the best view of the ground. Each view is photographed and compared before finally deciding on the ticket category.

What is also decided is the order in which they will sell in each category. Generally, all categories start with the seats most likely to be picked up by cameras to make sure that the stadiums look as full as possible.

Once seats and categories are fixed, they need to be priced. Given that it is a development tournament, profit is not the objective. But the biggest nightmare for organizers is people not turning up after taking complimentary tickets, wasting both money and space. So while a substantial number of tickets will be given free of cost to schoolchildren, they will also need to be ‘earned’ by the kids through various activities in the MXIM program.

At the same time, tickets can’t be priced out of reach. Eventual ly, the prices were fixed with a simple metric in mind. We wanted to give fans an opportunity to watch a World Cup game for less than a hundred rupees, because then nobody had an excuse to not watch a match.

The final and most important part of ticketing is deciding the various phases. The FIFA strategy is designed to reward football lovers first. So when the tickets were first released, spectators could buy only venue packages at a hefty sixty percent discount. The logic is that at that stage, the fans buying tickets did not even know the draw or the specific teams playing, just the match dates in a city. So they were buying purely for the love of football, and the privilege of watching a World Cup match, not a specific team.

The next stage of ticketing was after the draw, when the spectators actually knew the teams, and therefore the group stage, but had to take informed guesses on which team would end up in the knock out stages. And there are many smart buys available there. All those buying a quarterfinal ticket in Kolkata would have plotted the draw and are probably hoping for a Brazil game.

The final stage of ticket sales is during a tournament, literally mirroring the rise and falls of the competing teams. Back to the 16th of May. It was a nerve racking evening, waiting for the sales to start. And when the first report came in, just one hour later, Javier took the call and then turned to mouth ‘three thousand.’ Auspicious beginnings."

"By refusing to buckle under China’s threats on Doklam, India has called the bully’s bluff","Standing on the Himalayan crest with well-developed infrastructure, China is in a militarily advantageous position along much of the border with India. The tri-border overlooking the Chinese-held Chumbi valley is one of the few areas where India still holds a distinct advantage, with Chinese forces within Indian observation cum artillery range. If China were to capture Bhutan’s high-altitude Doklam plateau, it would not only mitigate that vulnerability but also hold a knife to India’s jugular vein – the Siliguri Corridor, through which Bhutan’s communications and transportation arteries also pass.

While existential stakes drove India to halt China’s construction of a strategic highway through Doklam, Beijing made a serious strategic miscalculation by intruding there: It anticipated Bhutan’s diplomatic protest but not India’s swift, stealthy military intervention. The Indian army had long geared up to respond to such a contingency.

No Indian government can countenance the construction of a road through Doklam that allows China to bring main battle tanks to the tri-border and implement, in the event of a war, its military plan to decapitate India. In such a corridor-bisecting scenario, while China gobbles up Arunachal Pradesh, the other northeast Indian states, as a Chinese state mouthpiece warned recently, could become “independent”.

Today, thanks to its miscalculation, China finds itself in an unenviable position: It must extricate itself from a militarily wretched situation in Doklam, where its intruding soldiers are caught in a pincer movement. If China were to initiate hostilities at the tri-border, it will likely be left, as in 1967, with a bloodied nose, given the Indian army’s terrain and tactical advantages.

Politically Beijing has boxed itself in a corner, with its intense psychological warfare (“psywar”) and disinformation operations failing to yield continuing gains, after the success in initially dominating the narrative. If anything, its psychological operations (“psy-ops”) and manipulation of legal arguments (“lawfare”), as by selectively quoting an 1890 colonial-era accord, offer India important lessons. It is standard Chinese strategy to play the victim in any conflict or dispute, as China brazenly did even in 1962.

Mounting frustration has sharpened Beijing’s war rhetoric. To compound matters, the standoff is imposing reputational costs on a power that supposedly brooks no challenge and is ever willing to wreak punishment. India, in the face of vitriolic warmongering, has defiantly stood up to China and refused to budge. By calling the bully’s bluff, India has set an example for other Asian states to emulate.

Beijing’s story that Indian troops “trespassed” into Chinese territory was designed to disguise its intrusion into tiny Bhutan. But this tale, along with President Xi Jinping’s vow not to permit the loss of “any piece” of Chinese land, deepens China’s discomfiture by undermining the image it has sought to project at home and abroad – Asia’s pre-eminent power that no neighbour will mess with.

In sum China, if it is to save face, needs India’s help to extricate itself from a mess of its own making. Beijing’s coarse statements and threats, while integral to its psywar, are also part of a negotiating ploy to secure a compromise on largely its terms.

There is no reason, however, why India should let China off the hook easily. With Xi looking ahead to this autumn’s Communist Party congress to cement his status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, India should play psychological hardball because Chinese incursions have become increasingly recurrent.

India should allow the Doklam military stalemate to drag on until the arrival of the harsh winter forces the rival troops to retreat, thus restoring the status quo ante, including frustrating China’s road-building plan. If an earlier negotiated mutual retreat from Doklam becomes possible, it should be based on an unequivocal assurance that China henceforth will refrain from unilaterally disturbing the territorial status quo anywhere in the Himalayan borderlands.

Implicitly, if not explicitly, China must come out a significant loser in order to help rein in its creeping, covert encroachments. There should be no more Depsangs, Chumars and Doklams or the quiet chipping away at Indian and Bhutanese lands."
Lights! Camera! Crisis! Advancing technology and borderline government hostility bring bure din to Bollywood,"Indians associate Bollywood, or the Hindi film industry, with glamour, big money, stardom, entertainment and beautiful people. It is seen as a wonderful place to be, perhaps because of the happy feelings we get when we watch Bollywood films. Therefore it becomes unthinkable to imagine this – Bollywood is in the middle of a major crisis.

Yes, we had a Baahubali 2 this year. It made people come to the theatres like never before. Yes, Dangal did extraordinarily well. Yes, Hindi Medium and Lipstick Under My Burkha found an audience despite low budgets. However, these few examples don’t give you the complete picture. Most trade analysts are stunned at how low collections have been for many big budget, well reviewed films.

Sure, perhaps the films lacked something in content. However, collections and footfalls have dropped to below 2013 levels for similar genre/ reviews/ likeability of the film. Films like Rangoon, Jagga Jasoos and Raabta, were made on a huge scale and with a novel concept. They found it difficult to garner even a third of the expected business to make the films reach breakeven point for their distributors.

New generation rom-coms like Ok Jaanu, Meri Pyaari Bindu and Noor struggled to reach a box office total of Rs 50 crore for the three films put together, something a single rom-com would easily achieve on its own a few years ago. Even Salman Khan starrer Tubelight struggled, with a Rs 125 crore box office take compared to over Rs 300 crore collections for his previous few films.

So, film collections on the whole are dropping. A few good films, when liked, get tremendous positive word of mouth with terrific velocity thanks to social media. This leads to a great success like Baahubali 2. Thirdly, if a film is not liked as much, or liked but not considered ‘must watch’, people are not interested to watch it.

Fourthly, only two kinds of films still seem to work – high spectacle or high concept. High spectacle films offer a visual experience that only a big screen can offer, say The Avengers movie or Baahubali. A high concept film offers a fresh take on a relevant subject, making a section of people want to watch it. Everything else is passé. People just don’t ‘need’ to watch movies anymore.

Finally, if you ask an average Indian why they watch movies, they will say it is for ‘time pass’. Well, this ‘time pass’ is already happening on the mobile phone now, for free or at a fraction of the cost of the movie ticket. YouTube recently reported it has 150 crore monthly viewers, with each viewer spending an hour a day on the site on an average. Facebook users, at 200 crore, watch tonnes of videos all day long. There are many other digital content apps making rapid inroads in India. Then, why go to the theatres to watch movies?

Making things worse is rampant piracy and no real will from the authorities to eliminate it. This is mainly due to our government’s borderline hostile attitude towards Bollywood, mistakenly seen as an industry of rich, entitled people (due to a tiny number of visible stars). We also have regulations that tax Bollywood films more than any other form of content – films attract a higher GST rate than other content.

The poor infrastructure in cities that makes getting to a theatre a harrowing, pot-hole filled experience where one is stuck in traffic jams, also hinders ticket sales. It’s simpler to just stream content directly on your phone or TV.

Of course, some of the blame lies with Bollywood as well. There’s been little cost evolution with advancing technology. Films are still shot expensively, using giant cameras and light setups. Stars, even those who are not attracting audiences, charge way more than they bring in. Many younger actors have entourages on set that cost several lakhs per day.

As a result, a shoot day in Mumbai could easily cost Rs 20 lakh. A film with an average budget may need 80 such days! Compare this to a stand up comic video you liked on Facebook, which was probably shot for a few lakhs at the most. Today, even inexpensive cellphones offer 4K resolution recording capability.

News channels have dumped big camera setups for mobile phone journalism. Also, plenty of acting talent in the digital world is ready to work without the umbrella-holding, ego-boosting entourage. How does Bollywood ever expect to compete? Costs need to go down all across by at least 50%.

The film industry can no longer rely on entry barriers in content distribution. Earlier, only films had the marketing budgets and the screens to show their content, with television being the only competition to a certain extent. Today, distribution barriers are all but gone. Now, anyone with a cellphone is both a content creator as well as a content distributor while of course continuing to be a content consumer.

In this ‘new’ normal Bollywood needs to wake up, revise content and reduce both costs and egos at the same time. With better taxation structures and a firm hand on piracy, government needs to support an industry that directly and indirectly hires millions. One hopes Bollywood will evolve and we will create better and cheaper content to keep our film industry alive for the next several generations. Hopefully, picture abhi baaki hai mere dost!"
Why Ravichandran Ashwin is India’s best all-round cricketer,"While the current dispensation in Indian cricket is all out to promote new entrant Hardik Pandya as a genuine all-rounder in the team, they may end up ignoring another cricketer who has just crossed an important milestone in all-round performance – Ravichandran Ashwin. The 30-year- old hit a half century in the first innings of the second test against Sri Lanka and became the fastest cricketer to reach the milestone of 2,000 test runs and 250 wickets. He has even gone past the fabled quartet of the eighties comprising Kapil Dev, Richard Hadlee, Imran Khan and Ian Botham on this occasion.

The past few years have seen two finger spinners dominate test cricket: Sri Lanka’s Rangana Herath and Ashwin. During the course of India’s first innings in the second test at Colombo, the duo was pitted against each other. Ashwin was on strike and Herath was at the bowler’s end. Ashwin stepped out and hoisted Herath for a six over the long-off boundary to reach 2,000 runs in style. Herath had the last laugh when he clean bowled Ashwin off the very next ball, but that had already put Ashwin on a different pedestal in the list of top all-rounders. What Ashwin achieved in his 51st test was achieved by Hadlee in 54 tests while Imran and Botham needed 55 tests to reach the milestone.

Ravichandran Ashwin brings up his FIFTY with a six. Goes past 2000 Test runs as well. #SLvIND pic.twitter.com/K8Aa1wQAzf — Cricbuzz (@cricbuzz) August 4, 2017

Pandya is young and can evolve into a genuine all-rounder but he will have to prove himself on the big stage. At the moment, Pandya’s bowling can best be utilised to contain batsmen rather than take wickets. Ashwin is easily the best spin bowler in the Indian side over the last few years. The fact that this was Ashwin’s 11th half century to go with his four centuries speaks volumes of his consistency."
What dies when a language dies,"In a commendable effort to document and thereby help preserve the country’s linguistic diversity, the People’s Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI) has been working on a multi-volume compendium of languages spoken across all the different states. At the a launch of the latest volumes, PLSI chairman Ganesh N Devy highlighted how India had lost 250 languages in the last five decades and another 400 are at the risk of dying in the coming 50 years. Even while forcing us to face the great and unacknowledged diversity of languages in India, Devy emphasizes that India is becoming a graveyard of languages.

A fine TV conversation between Ravish Kumar and Devy gives us some sense of what’s at stake:

A useful excerpt of Devy’s argument above is translated below:

“It was thought that there was an original language and from that all languages emerged, many families of languages in the world would have had a mother family. But this thought has not found a scientific basis, because language is constructed from the ground …

Every language is a unique worldview … the way we see length and breadth in one language we do not in another. If we did then for my ‘mausera bhai’ and ‘chachera bhai’ there would not be only the word ‘cousin’ in English…

The dying of one language is more painful than the death of one human being although the death of a human being is also painful, indeed the death of anyone is painful. But the death of language is especially painful because the building of each and every word takes so much labour.

A poet doesn’t create a word on a page. It takes decades, 50 years, 100 years doing one kind of work to build words associated with that work. Like the Mumbai dabbawalas have their own idiom now or the bus drivers or see what’s written on the back of trucks. Then these things slowly start coming into language and a novel or travelogue standardizes them but behind that is the labor of thousands and lakhs of truck drivers, say.

Language is a currency. Like there is currency in the bank, language holds the currency of our thinking. And like it takes labor to put currency in the bank, unless it’s black money, the death of a language is the wiping out of the labor of thousands of years. Demonetization is nothing by comparison.”"
Canada Turns Montreal Olympic Stadium Into Shelter For Asylum Seekers Coming From The US,"Health authorities and aid workers in Canada have opened the Olympic Stadium in Montreal to house refugees crossing over from the United States of America.

"Being American: Trump notwithstanding, the US is moving away from associating national with ethnic identity","Boston: What is eternal? Not a trivial question nor one that can be answered readily. A few days ago five young persons in a summer camp here had a conversation about it. They were playing Apples with Apples in which an adjective had to be paired with an apt noun. The players were three nine-year-olds and two teenage campers. One chosen adjective was ‘eternal’.

Our nine-year-old grandson, Rohan, and his two friends proposed ‘Saturn’ as a noun that could be legitimately described as eternal. The teenagers in the other team came up with ‘Church’ asserting there would be no Saturn if Jesus Christ had not created the universe. Rohan turned to his buddy Henry: “Is church eternaI? I don’t know much about religion, do you?” Henry shrugged. And Rosie, their teammate, piped in: “I’m Jewish!”

Youthful uncertainty aside, the situation creates ground for speculative reflection. In all likelihood there is nothing in the cosmos that is eternal, not even this universe of ours or the numerous others that might exist. Neither Saturn nor the church are permanent features of cosmic reality. Yet, our young campers believed eternity was a valid qualifier of the nouns they had selected.

Can such assumptions change with age and the acquisition of incremental knowledge? Yes, in many instances. The three nine-year-olds playing the above game are somewhat conscious of the limitations of their store of knowledge. I suspect, however, that most people find it more comforting to believe in the certainty of religious doctrine than to inculcate the endless curiosity of an inquiring mind honed by information and evolving perspectives.

The teenagers who believe the church is eternal and Jesus Christ created the universe will have to cross many hurdles before they understand, if ever, a reality founded on fact and observation. They feel secure in Christian certainty. As do, it appears, a significant number of Americans.

A detailed survey of 8,000 voters conducted by the Democracy Fund, a bipartisan foundation, asked people what being American meant. 56% of Republicans thought being Christian was important to being an American, as did a third of Democrats. Among Trump voters, 63% felt being Christian was crucial to their notion of an American identity. And Trump supporters placed an emphasis on the importance of European ancestry and Christianity for anyone claiming to be an American. Paradoxically, nationwide the trend is quite different.

Survey results from 1996 to now reveal a declining proportion who believe in Christianity as a mark of being American. From 53% in ’96 it rose to 64% after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but declined sharply since then to a 44% nationwide average in 2014, then to 39% in 2016. The decline continues. The fastest growing segment of the American belief spectrum, around 20% now, is that of non-believers including atheists, agnostics and those who belong to no religion. The church it seems may not be eternal after all.

America as a whole is moving away from exclusionary conceptions of national identity even as Trump supporters cling on to an idea of America as definably Christian and European. Fully 90% of Democrats think diversity is important to the American identity; surprisingly, the same survey shows 80% of Republicans today agree.

In fact, its founding fathers never intended this nation to be Christian. In the late 18th century they gave it a secular constitution that served to influence the approach of several subsequent founders of republics, such as India’s BR Ambedkar, who drafted India’s secular constitution and firmly believed that a singular religious identity would never work for the nation.

The notion of turning the United States into a Christian nation took root first in the early 19th century, says Geoffrey R Stone in his book on a different subject, Sex and the Constitution. The attempt has gathered intermittent momentum since then but has clearly not succeeded. America remains secular. Trends indicate it is not likely to ever become an exclusionary Christian nation, to the mounting frustration of ideologues and bigots who currently occupy positions of influence."

108-kg Actress Refuses To Gain More Weight For TV Show,"Actress Anjali Anand, who currently weighs 108 kg, has refused to put on more weight for her role of an oversized girl in the upcoming TV show ""Dhhai Kilo Prem"".

Anjali, who is making her acting debut with the show, was asked by makers to put on more weight. However, she refused to do so.

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

Not only Anjali, even Meherzan has gained 16 kg weight for his role.

Baby Girl Who Was Adopted By Sunny Leone Was Turned Down By 11 Couples Before She Found A Home,"Sunny Leone is now a mother and she has never been this happy. All the pictures and her interviews prove that she’s enjoying every bit of being a mother to the bundle of joy in her life, Nisha.

However, not many know that the toddler that Sunny adopted was turned down by 11 prospective set of parents before she finally found her family. Adoption agency CARA has confirmed the news. We all know that parents who look for babies to adopt are very picky and anal about the kids they choose.

Twitter

From physical appearance of the kid to medical history, everything plays a major role in the final decision making.

“Without looking at color, background and health status, Sunny Leone happily took the child in adoption. We respect that they didn’t try to bend the rules and stood in the queue like all the other parents,” said Child Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) CEO Lt Col Deepak Kumar.

Twitter

Sunny had applied for adoption on the web portal of CARA, the apex body for adoption, on September 30 last year and was referred a child on June 21. Leone gave her assent the following day as parents are given 48 hours to accept the child.

Twitter

On completing all the formalities, Sunny brought Nisha home from Latur in Maharashtra into pre-adoption foster care and is now awaiting a court order which will declare the couple the legal parents of the nearly two-year-old.

60 per cent of the children referred to foreign nationals are special needs children and 90 per cent are those older than two years reflects the fact that such children find less acceptability among domestic applicants, Kumar explained.

In fact, concerned about parents delaying the adoption process, the central adoption body had in May this year revised its rules and said it would only refer one child at a time to prospective parents instead of three in one go.

Prepare Yourself To Witness A Beefed-Up Ranbir Kapoor For His Upcoming Flick Where He Is Set To Play Muscle Man Sanjay Dutt,"From Aamir Khan’s physical transformation in Dangal to a fit Shushant Singh Rajput’s who played MS Dhoni in his biopic, Bollywood has never shied away from creating superstar physiques forged for the big screen.

Now Ranbir Kapoor, who has always surprised his audience with his acting skills but never with a muscle-bound frame, is all set to hit the big screen again with Sanjay Dutt's biopic. Only this time he’s packing on a tonne of muscle to play the legend!

vinno-khobor.com

It seems like the actor making a hard comeback after his disappointing maiden production ‘Jagga Jasoos’; quite literally by already packing an enormous 13 kilos of pure muscle! In one of the leaked pictures, the actor seems to be working himself hard in the gym for a massive full-body transformation!

From the looks of it, he is on course to surprise us yet again, this time in probably a more emphatic way than before. The film is being helmed by Rajkumar Hirani and is slated to release next year in March.

Long Walk Of Faith,"ACHARYA VARDHMAN SAGARJI is camping for chaturmaas in Shravanabelagola with 44 monks, and will stay on for the much-awaited Mahamastakabhisheka of Bahubali on the Vindhyagiri Hill. He talks to NARAYANI GANESH



Acharya Vardhman Sagarji led a group of 44 male and female monks on a padayatra from Rajasthan to Karnataka to participate in the 2018 Mahamastakabhisheka of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola that is to take place during February 7-26.This ceremony is conducted every 12 years,ever since the statue was first installed and consecrated in 981 CE by Chamunda Raya, a minister from the southern kingdom of Madhura. The venerated Digambar spiritual leader,Vardhman Sagarji,reached the sacred town of Shravanabelagola on June 4 this year and will stay on for the big event in February 2018. He is observing chaturmaas here,from July 7 till Deepavali and will stay on till the Mahamastakabhisheka concludes early next year, during end February. This is not his first time here. Vardhman Sagarji had come in 1993 and 2006 as well for the grand headanointing ceremony of the towering figure of Bahubali, the son of the first tirthankara, Adinath Rishabdev, who gave up his kingdom and other possessions to become an ascetic. Like this time, on the earlier two occasions, too, the Jain Acharya spent chaturmaas here in Shravanabelagola.Devotees point out that he follows a disciplined daily routine and still drinks only well water and eats food cooked over a coal-fired stove. In the course of a conversation, he answered the following questions:





Why did you undertake the padayatra from Rajasthan to Karnataka that took you one whole year to complete?



■We set off from Niwai near Jaipur, Rajasthan, and undertook the journey to Shravanabelagola by foot,covering a distance of 2,500 km in 365 days. During the course of the yatra,several events were organised, including panchakalyanak and the chaturmaas.Diksha was also given. More importantly, the journey was crucial to creating public awareness not just about the forthcoming Mahamastakabhisheka of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola, but also to create more knowledge about Jain dharma and the teachings of the tirthankaras.The yatra was sponsored by devotees, some of whom also participated in the pilgrimage.



Why is the Mahamastakabhisheka conducted once in 12 years?



■ It is like the Kumbha Mela for the Jain community.Moreover,we need that much time to prepare for such a mega event. Since it is only once in 12 years, people look forward to it as an important event and it is a major attraction not just for Jains and devotees of Bahubali,but for people of all faiths and it is a big tourist attraction as well.



What is the significance of the Mahamastakabhisheka?



■ Imagine, the sculpture of Bahubali is so beautiful and it has stood there for more than 1,000 years now.Yet, we still do not know the name of the sculptor! We do know that the statue was commissioned by Chamunda Raya and, of course,there are many stories around how the sculpture came into existence. One story goes that the sculptor demanded payment equal to the weight of stone chips that fell off during the sculpting, in gold. But later, he decided not to take any payment once he realised his ego was getting the better of him. There is another story of how when Chamunda Raya initiated the pouring of milk over the statue,the milk would not flow beyond the neck.Then an elderly woman, Gullikayi Ajji — actually, Padmavathy the protective goddess or yakshi of the region — comes along with a small container of milk and when she offers that to Bahubali, much milk flows all the way down and even fills up the large Kalyani Tank between Vindhyagiri and Chandragiri hills.The incident brought home to Chamunda Raya the truth that when one operates from pride and ego,nothing is achieved, but when one acts with humility, love and devotion,one is showered with Divine Grace.



What would you say is Bahubali’s eternal message?



■ Ahimsa se sukh; tyag se shanti; dhyan se siddhi and maitri se pragati — happiness from nonviolence;peace from sacrifice; realisation from meditation and progress from friendship. Bharat and Bahubali were sons of Adinath and were heirs to the kingdom but when Bharat decided to wage war against his brother, Bahubali declined and instead of risking the lives of his people, offered to combat just Bharat in three ways, one to one…. and Bahubali won. An angry Bharat released his chakra that had helped him conquer several territories so far but the chakra stopped short of entering Bahubali’s territory and so Bharat lost. But this triggered a train of thought in Bahubali who decided to give up everything and become an ascetic. He stood in the open in penance for one whole year, even as anthills grew at his feet and creepers clung to him as they used his body as support.This way, Bahubali attained kaivalya (enlightenment) and also achieved moksha — before his father Adinath, the first tirthankara, could attain moksha although he, too, had attained kaivalya state.



In most text books, Jainism is always attributed to Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, but it existed long before even Adinath, the first tirthankara.



■Yes, it is believed that Bharat’s son Marichi’s Atman became Mahavira,the 24th and last tirthankara.Every era gives rise to 24 tirthankaras, so Jainism has neither beginning, nor end.



Can you tell us something about the Jain practice of voluntarily giving up one’s life, known as Sallekhana or Santhara. Recently a girl child reportedly practised this; is there no age limit?



■ About sallekhana — no, there is no age limit. Either you have finished all worldly responsibilities and decide it is time for you to go or you suffer a terminal illness and wish to go.For the latter, it has to be confirmed by doctors that no medicine or treatment can save the patient’s life.The process is that slowly, in a phased manner,you reduce your intake of food and fluids, until you abstain altogether.According to legend, Emperor Chandragupta Maurya is said to have performed Sallekhana here, in Shravanabelagola, after completing all his responsibilities.

Baba Ramdev Wanted Patanjali Employees To Work For 'Free' Claims Former CEO,"Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev's Patanjali is one of the biggest brands in India now and has shown signs of growing even bigger.

BCCL/ File

But it appears that the benefits of the sales worth Rs 10,561 crore in the last financial year is not reaching the people who made it possible.

According to former CEO of Patanjali, SK Patra, the company believes its employees are doing a 'seva' (voluntary service) and can work without being paid.

""Patanjali pay very little to the people who work for them. Babaji (Baba Ramdev) calls it ‘seva’. For instance, I was doing two jobs there — at Patanjali Ayurved and Patanjali Food Park. They had promised to pay for both. But he would announce to everyone that 'Patraji has come to do seva. Right now he is drawing salary, but soon, he won’t even take that…"" Patra told Mint.

Reuters/ File

Patra, an IT and IIM alumnus said he did not want to do 'seva' as Ramdev claimed and demanded money for the work he was doing.

""I used to respond, “No, I want my money.”... I said I don’t need it for myself. I have a family. I need money for my family, to support them and my relatives. Then Babaji relented and gave me a salary for one of the two jobs that I was performing. But basically his argument was — I have to offer free seva to his host of companies.""

Patra said he left the company due to the differences in their words and actions.

""I was also seeing the distance between their words and their actions and it troubled me. Eventually, it became too much. So I left.""

The notion of turning the United States into a Christian nation took root first in the early 19th century, says Geoffrey R Stone in his book on a different subject, Sex and the Constitution. The attempt has gathered intermittent momentum since then but has clearly not succeeded. America remains secular. Trends indicate it is not likely to ever become an exclusionary Christian nation, to the mounting frustration of ideologues and bigots who currently occupy positions of influence."

This Unique Celebration By Virat Kohli When A Wicket Falls Is Called The Dab And It's Fun To Watch,"The dab craze dance is becoming a popular way to celebrate in sports and cricketers are not far behind.

Virat Kohli has used this form of expression to celebrate the fall of a wicket and it's catching on with his teammates as well.

This can be seen during the Colombo Test against Sri Lanka. On Day 2 we saw it when Lokesh Rahul took a good catch and celebrated with Kohli.

Day 3 saw it once again when Kohli took a catch off the bowling of Umesh Yadav to send back Kusal Mendis.

It's a unique mode of celebrating and certainly fun to watch."
"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
Unfriendly fight: Tax raids on Congress minister ignite charges of partisanship by investigative agencies,"A political storm is raging over income tax raids on over 60 premises linked to Karnataka power minister DK Shivakumar, who was busy keeping together Congress’s group of 44 Gujarat MLAs before the August 8 Rajya Sabha election. Shivakumar has a reputation for being Congress’s money and muscle man in Karnataka, and income tax sleuths recovered Rs 10 crore from the raids. They have denied acting under political pressure and claim the raids were decided well in advance. Nevertheless questions are bound to be raised about the timing of the raids, which coincided with when Shivakumar was shepherding the Congress flock and trying to avoid a break in its ranks.

The resignation of veteran Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela followed by six MLAs in Gujarat last month precipitated a crisis for the party. The crisis came even as Congress party’s chief strategist Ahmed Patel faces a tough challenge in his bid to get re-elected to the Rajya Sabha. Congress has cried foul, claiming that BJP is offering Rs 15 crore for each MLA to break ranks which had forced them to seek refuge in Congress-ruled Karnataka. Income tax investigations and raids only of opposition parties can raise questions of partisanship of state investigative agencies, especially when it will be scarcely credible to most that only opposition parties offer illicit money to legislators, and not parties that are friendly to BJP.

All this is bound to spark further polarisation in an already polarised political atmosphere. To avoid this government should ensure that agencies like IT department are insulated from political control, else it could soon draw comparisons with CBI which was famously called a caged parrot by the Supreme Court in 2013."

"Back on the field, Rahul is doing what he does best","INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Back on the field, Rahul is doing what he does best

• Last updated on Thu, 03 Aug, 2017, 07:40 PM Vishaal Loganathan in Colombo

Rahul made a fluent 57 on his comeback before getting runout. © AFP

KL Rahul was enjoying a fine return to international cricket, after nearly four months, when a mix-up between him and Cheteshwar Pujara cut his innings short. Rahul hadn't played an international game since the fourth Test against Australia, and had to miss India's Champions Trophy campaign as well as the limited-overs tour to the Caribbean. In Sri Lanka, he was ruled out of the first Test due to a viral fever. He finally got his chance at the Singhalese Sports Club, and hit a fine fifty, his sixth fifty in as many innings, to make his return a memorable one.

Until the runout, Rahul had played the kind of innings that has underlined his potential in the Indian team. He was sound defensively, but also unafraid to play his shots. Elegance oozed out of his shots, but there was also a certain rawness to his innings. A rawness that Rahul quickly wanted out of the system. Hence, when the run out happened, Rahul threw a fit. In anger, he turned towards his partner, Cheteshwar Pujara, before walking off.

The anger was more at himself for getting out, rather than Pujara, he said at the end of the day's play.

""I wasn't upset with him. Run outs happen, it could have happened with anybody,"" Rahul said. ""It could have been him who got run out and it could have been my mistake. I wasn't disappointed about that. I was disappointed because I have been away from the game so long and I didn't want to get out at all. I wanted to be in the middle, play as many balls as I could, as many days as I could if I could bat. I was disappointed about that. I was looking good and just after lunch, a crucial time as a batsman, you can capitalise and get a lot of runs during that session. So I was disappointed that I got out at that time.""

Rahul missing games for his country has, sadly for him, become a pattern in his short career. It's part of why India have struggled to have their regular batting pair of him and Murali Vijay batting for a series of games. He said that although he's gotten used to missing games due to things not in his control, the comeback is never easy.

""I have been in and out of the team because of injuries. It's never easy to come back. It takes you a couple of games to get back into your groove as an opening batsman, understand where your off-stump is, to understand what pace you have to play at, how many shots are too many shots, how slow is too much slow. There are a lot of things, a lot of doubts in your mind if you keep going out and coming back in but yeah I have enjoyed the challenge.

""These injuries people might say there is certain part where I can control my body and I can take care of my body but sometimes it just happens. No matter how well I have taken care of my body, I have been injured a few times which is very unfortunate and which is very disappointing but each time I have come back, I have come back stronger, I have come back more hungry. Wanted to contribute to the team, wanted to make a difference to the team whenever I was out there in the middle. It's kind of taught me to value my position, value my opportunities each time go out on to the middle. I enjoy it and play it like my last game. That's something that has really worked well for me,"" he added.

Another worrying pattern for Rahul has been the inability to convert his fifties into hundreds. A run of seven straight fifties is no mean feat, but Rahul has shown previously that he has the aptitude for big hundreds. Midway through the question about why this was happening, Rahul jutted in saying, ""I'm dying to get that back"" before adding ""I've never chased numbers, firstly. My job as an opening batsman is to give the team a good start, lay a solid foundation and I think I've done that so far. Disappointing that I have not been able to convert that, but I think that will keep me more hungry. Each time I go back to bat, I will want to get more and more runs. I'm learning from my mistakes. Each time I've done a silly mistake and that's how it is. Life of a batsman is... you might play 60 balls perfectly and then one ball you get out.

""Maybe if this keeps going it might start playing on my mind. But nothing changes, you feel a lot more confident, you're seeing the ball a lot better, so you want to maybe play a little bit more positively. Maybe sometimes that has led to the downfall, maybe I try to play too many shots knowing that I'm set. All these things, all the answers to the questions I will only find when I'm in the middle and when I get a hundred. That's when I'll know what the right process is and how I need to go about my innings.""

India will be fervently hoping that he does that soon, but for now, just like him, they will be happy that KL Rahul is back on the field and doing what he does best.

What happens to your body when you stop having sex,"All of us go through dry spells at some point in life. But many of us aren't aware of the effects this can have on our body. While there are no severe repercussions (and many won’t experience any), if you stop having sex for a while, it can sometimes mess with your system. Here are five things that happen to your body when you abstain from sex for a long time.







Reduced sex drive

If you haven’t had sex for a long time, you may experience a loss in libido. You may not feel the desire to have sex, and even if you do have sex, it may not feel as enjoyable.



Loss of lubrication

For some women another side-effect of abstaining from sex is vaginal dryness. Older women, especially, may find it difficult to get properly lubricated when they have sex after a long interval.



Increased stress

Sex is found to help relieve stress, and when you take a sex hiatus, you may feel more wound up than ever. Sex releases feel-good hormones in the body, and an absence of those may make it difficult to manage stress.



Painful periods

Sex is also known to alleviate pain, and is quite effective with period cramps. When women orgasm while on their period, they have a uterine contraction which expels blood more quickly, thus helping to relieve pain. If you stop having sex, you may experience more pain during periods.



Discomfort during sex

The time you have sex after a long break, you may feel pain down there, and there may be vaginal soreness after. There also may be some muscle pain, because your body has got used to not having sex. It’s just like going for a run after a long time.

"With An Eye On China, India Has Already Constructed 27 Of The 73 Roads And Five More Stories","27 of the 73 roads approved along the India-China border have been completed and the rest are expected to be finished by end of 2022, the government said on Friday.

In a written reply to Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre said 73 Sino-Indian border roads along the Northern Borders were approved for construction.

AFP

""Out of this, 27 roads have been completed and the balance are planned for completion by December 2022,"" the minister said.

He said the delay in execution of road projects was due to delay in forest, wildlife and environment clearance.

Besides, hard rock stretches, limited working season, delay in land acquisition, difficulties in availability of construction material and damage due to natural disasters such as flash floods were also hampering work. Read More

Aamir Khan’s Dangal Inspires 478 YO Akhada In Varanasi To Break Stereotypes And Start Women's Wrestling

DNA





Swaminath Akhada situated at Tulsi Ghat in Varanasi has a history of 478 years and each year the akhada organises wrestling matches known as dangal on the occasion of Nagpanchmi. But this year was unique, as for first time in history, the akhada allowed women wrestlers to show their skills.

The credit goes to the Aamir Khan starrer Dangal, says the organiser, Sankatmochan Foundation. Over a dozen girls from Varanasi and other neighbouring districts of UP participated in the contest in the oldest inhabited city in the world.

Tulsi Ghat is named after the great Hindu poet of the 16th century, Tulsidas, who composed the Indian epic, Ramcharitmanas, at Varanasi. It’s believed that it was he who started dangalon the banks of river Ganges. The akhada has been functional ever since and has given the country wrestlers such as Kallu Pehlwan.

Three rounds of matches were held, with half the girls being eliminated in each round. In the end, four girls were declared winners by Sankatmochan Foundation. Read More

Heavy To Moderate Drinkers Are More Likely To Live Till The Age Of 85 Without Dementia Or Other Cognitive Impairments,"For all those struggling to fight their own case against their doctor or family members to lift the restrictions on their consumption of alcohol on a daily basis; here’s some good news that can help your cause.

maxim.com

A landmark 30-year study conducted by the University of California, San Diego concluded moderate-to-heavy drinkers are more likely to live till the age of 85 without Dementia or other cognitive impairments. More specifically drinkers were twice as likely to remain cognitively healthier than non-drinkers!

informe21.com

What does moderate or heavy drinking mean for gender and age-specific guidelines?

Moderate drinking involves drinking up to one alcoholic beverage a day for women of any age and men aged 65 or above, and up to two drinks a day for adult men under age 65. Heavy drinking is defined as having up to three alcoholic beverages per day for women of any adult age and men aged 65 or older, and up to four drinks a day for adult men under 65.

Drinking more than this is categorized as excessive and is not advisable!

portal.abczdrowie

Although this is not the first study to find a correlation between moderate alcohol intake and longevity it is one of the most conclusive ones till date!

""This study is unique because we considered men and women's cognitive health at late age and found that alcohol consumption is not only associated with reduced mortality, but with greater chances of remaining cognitively healthy into older age,"" said senior author Linda McEvoy, PhD, an associate professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

sciencedaily.com

""It is important to point out that there were very few individuals in our study who drank to excess, so our study does not show how excessive or binge-type drinking may affect longevity and cognitive health in ageing,"" adds McEvoy.

The study also doesn’t suggest that drinking is responsible for an increase in longevity and cognitive health."

Serpent Wisdom,"The serpents, endowed with higher intelligence, have been guiding human beings since time immemorial; sometimes even in the form of spiritual masters, writes MOHANJI



There are several worlds, constitutions, configurations, and also species.However, man-made machines can only show us certain aspects of the Milky Way, our planetary system. They can show us only the highly gross aspect. They cannot show us subtler planes. One such plane is what we call the Naga Loka, the world of serpents or snakes. These are beings who came to earth with superior wisdom to assist mankind, while it was evolving into a civilisation. That is why you can see Shiva with a snake around his neck, and also Vishnu, reclining on Shesha, the cosmic serpent. There are other dimensions to this symbolism of both Shiva and Vishnu. The multiple aspects of original creation were explained to mankind by serpents. This is reflected in our scriptures as words of wisdom by great sages. Subtleties of existence, or what is not so obvious, were explained to mankind by benevolent snake guides. These guides have donned the body of the snake so that they are left alone, though they are advanced enough to take any form they like at will.To the human eye, they appear snakes because humans are afraid of snakes.They may not seem as snakes to many other species on our own planet. It’s only when you meditate and attain a level of subtlety that you can see them.



And the serpents have the power to mask their world from aliens, as they are highly advanced beings.Another species, or beings of another world, can see their world only if they attain the same level of subtlety as that of the snakes, or if the snakes bestow them that power.Therefore, they are secured from outside invasion. Many serpent lords have lived on earth in human form.They have displayed superhuman capabilities. Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri, for example,was from the Naga Loka.He was found on the streets, as a baby protected by a snake.Nobody knows who his parents were.We have had many inter-galactic masters who have assumed the human form just to guide us. The ‘Nath’ tradition is closely linked to the higher order of guides from outside earth. Before eating food, I first offer it to our dear guides from the Naga Loka,because they have helped mankind a lot. Few know of their contribution to our civilisation. The snakes interpreted the dimensions of Parabrahma or the Supreme Father and brought the knowledge of the Supreme to the understanding levels of humans. It was the elevated guides from Naga Loka who came here and taught us about the various aspects of creation, existence, and dissolution.



And they actually told us about Shiva,Vishnu and Brahma being the embodiments of these aspects of the Supreme Lord. As always,we humans take everything for granted and complain when inspiration is lost. The serpents have subtly transferred much data to the human brain,which we have taken as our merit. It is not just the snake lords;we have also been guided by many species from outside the earth. Some are still living and guiding us. Since our capacities are limited to keep the channel of communication clean or to understand where it is coming from, using ego and nonunderstanding,we boast of our own originality, stature and attribute original thoughts to ourselves. We develop awareness based on the original thoughts provided by our guides or gurus. But, when we own them,we degenerate.When we do not show reverence and respect,we fall. Even Krishna, who is considered an avatar, says at various points:“Thus spoke the masters of the past”, refusing to take ownership of original thoughts, delivered by various mouths. He is a great master and he leads by example. There are so many dimensions, so many subtleties, which, with our current operating level, we cannot fathom; we can’t explain.We have to experience it.And in order to experience it, we need to attain higher levels of subtlety. In order to attain the subtlety, we need to go within and understand, accept and assimilate ourselves. Though the Nagas have donned the form of snakes, they are not our terrestrial snakes.They like to keep this shape because of flexibility and fluidity.They represent fluidity and spontaneity of linear existence.They opted for the snake’s body to remind us of our actual potential; these are celestial reminders for our existence.We must wake up.We must see.We must ‘live.’

This Woman’s Transformation Is An Example Of What Happens When You Change Your Bad Habits,"This 20-year-old woman who goes by the name of melephants on her Imgur account put up images of her stunning transformation after she lost 30lbs (14 kilos). The 4ft 10” woman who once weighed 143lbs, who now weighs 110lbs, transformed herself through cleaning her diet and increasing her activity levels.

Imgur user- melephants

She started adjusting her eating habits to the point where her meal consisted largely around a major source of protein (chicken, fish, eggs, yoghurt, protein shakes/bar) and veggies. The only time she increased her carb intake was on days that she trained.

Imgur user- melephants

Although she spent her time initially on a treadmill, she quickly switched to HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) when she didn't see any substantial results. That includes 30-second sprints with 30 second rest periods for a total of about 15 minutes.

Imgur user- melephants

She uses resistance training to work on her lower body two-three times per week and her upper body twice. The exercises she performs include deadlifts, squats, bench presses and hip thrusts. She claims weight training helped her make steady gains that she didn’t get from doing cardio alone.

Imgur user- melephants

She also recommends compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses for beginners looking to get a routine going for themselves. For people who are just starting out, she recommends a beginner’s routine called ‘StrongCurves’ by Bret Contreras, who also happens to have written a book on it.

Imgur user- melephants

Simple healthier habits have also gone a long way in helping her reach her goals. Sitting instead of standing on the train, drinking a lot more water through the day, avoiding stacking snacks and other junk food from her house.

If data is the new oil: Compensate citizens for their personal data used for Aadhaar and other purposes,"The Aadhaar juggernaut continues unabated. The government claims 99% of people over age 18 now have Aadhaar. I, however, belong to the 1% who don’t.

There are many others who are actively resisting getting the 12-digit unique ID number for a plethora of reasons. One of them is a crippling fear that Aadhaar violates our right to privacy and takes our personal information for various purposes. It is also being used by private corporate entities to create their own database. The UIDAI chairman admitted in an interview that Aadhaar can be used to create a 360-degree profile of an individual.

The biggest industrialist in India stated very clearly: “Data is the new oil” that would lead the world into a fourth industrial revolution. His words got me thinking. If data is indeed like oil, shouldn’t there be a price to it?

The Supreme Court is presently hearing arguments on whether Indians have a right to privacy and whether Aadhaar violates that right. Judging by the way things are unfolding since 2014, it’s simply too late to expect Aadhaar can be trashed.

For the sake of argument let us accept that, as the government propounds, we don’t have a right to privacy. We accept that citizens’ personal biometrics and metadata are being used by multiple companies and the government to achieve different objectives. It’s being used to make better policies after looking at spending patterns and demographic information or it is being used by companies to sell their products to me directly. Accepted that certain commercial bodies are doing deep packet inspection and using personal data of customers to earn massive profits.

The larger question now is: If my data has monetary value for the government and private players, shouldn’t i also benefit from it? If data is the ‘new oil’ and you are extracting that oil from me, it implies i am the resource. I should be compensated for providing that resource.

The way things are going, i wouldn’t be surprised if Aadhaar becomes mandatory for practically everything between birth and death. Let us accept that unquestioningly as well. Now, let us talk about the future.

If a citizen’s personal data is a commodity, which can be bought and sold by different entities like detergent or a pair of jeans, the citizen should get paid for it. Period.

Contractors engaged in enrolling people for Aadhaar should buy that resource at a price. These contractors should pay a flat upfront amount to the person who is enrolling and is converting into a rich resource. Since morals, beliefs and personal liberty matter little in this brave new world, i don’t think anyone would have a problem selling their soul for a high amount, say Rs 5 lakh. They will line up to link their bank accounts with Aadhaar the day this is announced.

A cheaper option would be to simply introduce Universal Basic Income (UBI) through Aadhaar. The Economic Survey 2016-17 points out that a UBI of Rs 12,000 per person per year is an optimal amount. If the government starts a UBI programme, it can gradually get rid of all other targeted welfare schemes. The way Aadhaar is becoming an impediment for people to get welfare currently is causing unimaginable pain and hardship. So just get rid of that welfare completely instead of destroying it piecemeal. UBI in partial lieu of Aadhaar should compensate for acquiring data for the remainder of the life of a citizen. Rich or poor doesn’t matter.

UIDAI itself can become a for-profit entity which buys and sells citizens’ data to whoever asks for it for a price that is transferred directly to the bank account of the ‘resource’ persons. Suppose a school asks for the data of a child for admission, the parent would get an alert on her phone which will quote a price for the data exchange and purpose of usage. If the person accepts the terms, the data will be shared by UIDAI with the school and their account will be immediately credited with the agreed price. UIDAI gets a cut.

Every exchange of such data from one entity to the other would be for a price depending on the value that the UIDAI assigns. This can be done when UIDAI facilitates these data transactions. All contracts signed between UIDAI and private entities would be public and available for review. This way, data would indeed become the new oil.

Since there is an overwhelming opinion amongst many experts that our data is being used for profit and profiling anyway, i believe it’s time we start discussing the next step: Of becoming a willing commodity and demanding a price from those interested in using us. Critics, me included, need to evolve and ask the government to simply be open about the uses of Aadhaar data.

Make it transparent and incentivise people to give up their rights. Tell us citizens where you intend to sell us and give us a share of the profits. If we are all being treated as a commodity now, tell us that to our face and we may be willing to get used to the idea.

The Aadhaar data river is flowing into an ocean consisting of large private entities and government who are benefitting from our data. We citizens need to build a small canal to irrigate our own farms. Why should they have all the fun?"

‘Bhojpuri is the most rapidly developing language in the world’,"Recently Toronto made boastful headlines because 140 languages are spoken there, because of how people from all over the world have congregated in this multicultural mecca.

But hey what about Mumbai?

GN Devy says there are around 300 languages active in Mumbai. All the 40 languages of Gujarat are spoken here, the 52 languages of Maharashtra, 14 languages of Karnataka. Bhojpuri is spoken on a big scale. They all came here for jobs and business and brought their language along.

But it’s Bhojpuri that People’s Linguistic Survey of India chairman Devy sees shining most brightly. He said in a TV conversation:

“Bhojpuri has not only stayed alive, in the whole world, and I am saying this in the most considered way, in the whole world Bhojpuri is the most rapidly developing language. It has music, cinema, philosophy. In the oral tradition of Bhojpuri, there is so much wisdom. Bhojpuri people are enterprising and the Bhojpuri language is even getting them employment these days.

This is because in states like UP and Bihar we have decided that only Hindi is the language, and Bhojpuri is sort of like a dialect, I wouldn’t call it a secondary citizen but still it has a different social status. Here look at the lessons of history.

In the Roman empire the Latin language declined and those languages that were considered vernacular grew bigger – French, Italian and Spanish were once under the Latin umbrella. Here the dynamic was that if a language tries to build an empire and tries to trample down other languages then those other languages rise up in some way. Today take Basque in Spain and Bhojpuri in India, they are fantastic.”

Maybe it was evidence of this ascendency that SRK was recently seen taking lessons in the Bhojpuri song ‘Lagawe lu jab lipistick’. Where? In Varanasi."
Did You Know Once Sachin Tendulkar Was So Angry On Sourav Ganguly That He Almost Sent Him Home During A Tour?,"The bond between Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly goes beyond the boundaries of the cricket stadium.

AFP

But there was one occasion that Sachin the skipper almost sent Ganguly home midway through a tour!

Yes, this happened during the 1997 tour of West Indies. Dada's performance was dippinf and the team was not doing well in general. He asked Sachin for some advice on what to do, the skipper told him to go for a run in the morning.

AFP

Ganguly missed the run and Sachin was so furious he said that he would be sending him home. That made Dada get his act right and he eventually went on to form a lethal opening combo with Sachin.

AFP

So this one incident may have turned the tide for Ganguly and we can be thankful to Sachin for using an iron hand when he had to."
"Despite Winning French Open Title, Rohan Bopanna Is Overlooked For Arjuna Award And He's Not Happy About It","Angry at missing out on the Arjuna award once more, Rohan Bopanna blasted the AITA for not nominating him within the deadline.

However the Federation said there was no point sending his application since he did not meet the requisite criteria.

bccl

The deadline to send applications expired on April 28 but the All India Tennis Association (AITA) made up its mind to send his name only on June 14 after he won the French Open mixed doubles title with Canadian partner Gabriela Dabrowski.

AITA had chosen Saketh Myneni, winner of two medals at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, for nomination and the awards selection committee stuck to the deadline.

In the past, Bopanna has been nominated several times but his application has always been rejected.

bccl

""We professional tennis players put in a lot to bring laurels to our country. And no one could question otherwise. However, it is when the system (the Tennis Association in this case) functions sloppily that is not only disrespectful but also robs one of the hope of a deserving acknowledgment,"" Bopanna said in a scathing statement.

""I am calling out to the lack of professionalism and efficiency by AITA for not sending my nomination for the Arjuna Award before the deadline. I have witnessed many such excuses for the past decade (while I was eligible and my record didn't falter) and then too, have never stood for it.""

However, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee said they had a reason for not sending his application this year.

""AITA did not send Rohan Bopanna's application for Arjuna award this year since his application was getting rejected all these years because he has not won any medals for the country at the Asian Games,"" Chatterjee told PTI from Cambodia, where he reached after attending the International Tennis Federation AGM in Vietnam.

""We knew why it was being rejected all the time.""

Asked why AITA decided to send his entry in June, Chatterjee claimed, ""I took a chance since it was a Grand Slam. It's like winning a world championship. So, we thought let's send it now.""

Points are given for winning medals at the World Championship/World Cup, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Championships (biennial) and Commonwealth championships (biennial) while evaluating the applications by the committee.

Bopanna had skipped the Incheon Asian Games along with Somdev Devvarman and veteran Leander Paes as the Coorgi had points to defend on the professional tour.

AITA had allowed all senior players to miss the Games even though Sania Mirza decided to turn up for country after initially expressing her wish to skip the continental event.

Myneni had won the mixed doubles gold with Sania.

bccl

The AITA official said he understands Bopanna's frustration.

""I do understand Rohan is disappointed for not getting the award, but it was because he did not meet the criteria for the award in 2016. He should see the criteria before making any comment,"" he said.

Chatterjee said winning the Grand Slam title at Roland Garros makes him eligible for next year and they will certainly nominate him.

""We do feel he now meets the criteria after winning the mixed doubles of the French Open. AITA will again try for him next year,"" he said.

The selection committee considered performances between January 2013 and December 2016 and Bopanna has achieved some tremendous results in this period but only on the Pro Circuit, not while representing India in a multi-disciplinary events.

bccl

He reached a career-high rank of three in the world in July 2013 and bagged nine ATP titles, including two Master series (Madrid, 2015 and Monte Carlo, 2017).

He finished fourth at the Rio Olympic Games with Sania Mirza in the mixed doubles and that could have given some weightage to his nomination had AITA sent his application.

Compared to Bopanna, Myneni may not have been very successful on the Tour but has logged enough points for his medal-winning performances at Incheon Games.

Bopanna also chose to congratulate Myneni.

""I want to take this platform to congratulate Saketh Myneni on receiving this award. I couldn't be more proud as I have seen him grow into the player and the man he is today,"" Bopanna mentioned in his statement.

Why Vijay Rupani is spot on about Congress’ fortunes in Gujarat,"The attack on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s car in Banaskantha while he was on his way back to the helipad has to be condemned in every possible manner. Though Rahul must be given credit for saying that he will not be bogged down by such acts of violence, but he should be a worried man when it comes to his party’s dwindling fortunes. Assembly elections in Gujarat are scheduled to be held in December. The worry is not just about defections in his party, but also the glaring omission of Congress MLAs at a time when the state is dealing with heavy rainfall and floods.

Visiting flood-affected areas and blaming the ruling dispensation for shoddy relief-work is par for the course for any political party in a state where elections are due in a few months. But how does one justify the absence of its MLAs from the ground when their visible presence would have made a world of difference in the eyes of the affected populace. Consider this – six out of the nine assembly segments in Banaskantha district are held by Congress. Yet all these MLAs are a part of the 44 MLAS who have been shepherded to Bengaluru before the August 8 Rajya Sabha election.

Rahul Gandhi shown black flags, his convoy attacked in Gujarat https://t.co/zFs8mILiuF — TOI India (@TOIIndiaNews) August 4, 2017

BJP has already moved in for the kill and is now totally focused on demolishing the Congress stronghold in Banaskantha. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and his cabinet colleagues have been visiting flood-affected areas to monitor relief-work being carried out. Their task has been made easier by the absence of local MLAs. Rupani took to microblogging site – Twitter – to vent his ire against Rahul’s visit where he compared the MLAs sitting in Bengaluru being akin to the Congress leader’s foreign vacations.

The perpetual tourist, Shri @OfficeOfRG came to Gujarat but the people of Gujarat are asking- where are our INC MLAs in this crucial time? — Vijay Rupani (@vijayrupanibjp) August 4, 2017

Over 200 people have lost their lives in the flood and rain in the state out of which Banaskantha and Patan districts account for nearly 70 of them. So far Congress’ focus appears to be entirely on securing a Rajya sabha seat for Ahmed Patel. Could the absence of MLAs for a lone RS seat cost them the entire election?"
"Teleportation: Beam us up one day, Scotty?","By: Prakash Chandra

When news broke last month of Chinese researchers successfully teleporting a photon — a particle of light —from an instrument on the Tibetan plateau to an orbiting satellite 1,400 km away in space, it sent a frisson of excitement through the scientific community. But it wasn’t quite ‘Beam me up, Scotty’ time yet.

When physicists talk about teleportation, they mean the creation of a single particle that can be in two or more states at the same time, and transferring characteristics that define the particle’s nature and behaviour to its twin without using any physical link.

The particles share their ‘quantum states’ — such as energy, motion and magnetic field — regardless of the distance separating them. Scientists have known for decades that teleportation is possible using a process called ‘quantum entanglement’ — at least for subatomic particles.

This involves what Albert Einstein famously described as “spooky action at a distance” between two linked particles that are created at the same time and place so that essentially they have the same existence.

The entanglement so entwines the fate of each inextricably that if one changes its state, the other takes on its old properties and becomes a replica of the first’s original state.

This ‘entangled’ state continues even if you separate the particles: if one particle changes, its doppelgänger in the other location also changes. This goes against the known laws of physics where we are used to everyday objects behaving in familiar ways.

Till now, this ability to transfer key properties from a quantum particle to another has been confined to experiments at limited distances. So how did the Chinese teleport a photon many times this distance into space? Well, photons can travel easily through the vacuum of space, provided they are able to negotiate Earth’s fickle atmospheric conditions on their way out first.

The Chinese apparently created thousands of quantum-entangled pairs of photons per second and allowed one from each pair to ride a shaft of light that was beamed towards an orbiting satellite. A supersensitive receiver on board the satellite detected the quantum states of the single photons coming its way so that the entangled photons could be transmitted to ground stations.

The phantom character of quantum particles that lets them be teleported —the simultaneous existence of two of a kind — can be used for developing quantum computers. Here, information is processed in the form of qubits used in computers today.

With quantum computing, you can have central processing elements smaller than a sugar crystal that can carry out unimaginably complex computations and they are faster, too. And this also means practically ‘un-hackable’ cryptography as data encryption using qubits is practically unbreakable.

So, will human teleportation be a reality someday? Teleporting photons or atoms is one thing, and teleporting people quite another. To vaporise a human made up of zillions (one with 27 zeros) of atoms and accurately reassemble them elsewhere seems well-nigh impossible. Even the data processing required to teleport, say, a teacup, without the tea, would take many times the age of the universe.

True, in principle, the laws of physics allow you to recreate anything anywhere, provided you satisfy two key conditions: that you have the requisite processing power, and are willing to destroy the original (teleportation destroys the object before reconstructing it). Quantum travellers would, therefore, be virtually killed if they tried to travel in this way, as it’s only their ‘copy’ that emerges at the other end.

Perhaps, in some far future, humans may build a device similar to the ‘beam transporter’ in Star Trek. Inside the transporter, computers codify your atomic structure and transmit it on laser beams across the universe.

At the destination, this ‘quantum communication’ is received by computers that use vats of chemicals to reconstruct you in your original image. And lo! You are ready to check your arrival and beam-out data from whichever universe you may be in."

"There is no military solution in J&K, separatist finances should have been targeted much earlier","The most ineffective way of fighting your adversary in a hybrid conflict, like the one in Jammu & Kashmir, is to fight it only through the military route. This mostly ensures that you restore temporary order, but mayhem will soon return and often in your own presence.

The scope of hybrid conflict extends to multiple domains. Violence at different levels and different locations keeps the conflict relevant and visible while an adversary delves into other domains silently and effectively. Among these domains are promotion of radical ideology, creation of intense alienation, keeping the organs of government on tenterhooks and incapable of governing, intimidation of government agencies, media and private citizens, gun running and narcotics to sustain finances, and lastly and perhaps most importantly maintaining financial conduits for the unimpeded flow of money into the conflict system.

The invisible elements of hybrid conflict are far more dangerous than the seemingly more potent but largely visible elements such as cannon fodder terrorists. A common question which even some intellectuals ask me is – “why despite killing so many terrorists and losing so many soldiers, is little headway being made in J&K?” This is because, while keeping the army and police engaged in the fight against terrorists and stone throwers, there have been a range of activities taking place under the sponsorship and patronage of a host of other people.

The separatists have been projecting their cause through literature, social media, media patronage, mosque power, direct engagement and creation of structures which can be activated in minutes to respond to diverse situations. The campaign to radicalise Kashmiri society has been a deliberate ploy to empower the mosque and link Pakistan’s chosen path of radical Islam to the Valley’s new ideology.

None of us could stop it because of our intellectual inability to realise what was shaping up around us. In any case India’s security agencies were largely bereft of knowledge on religious ideology when radical Islamists across the border were planning and coordinating activities in the Valley with impunity.

None of the above can be done by separatists with the level of competence they have displayed without adequate financial backing, a truism for any such conflict. Islamic State could survive three years in northern Iraq because of looted finances from the Mosul treasury and revenues of taxation and the oil refinery. Once most of that was spent it was no longer possible to continue in the same mode.

It was, therefore, always a question of evolving our own strategy through ‘whole of government’ approach. Unfortunately the political class could not appreciate what its role was at the operational and strategic level. The problem was their perception that it was a conflict situation and therefore the responsibility of the security forces.

The separatists have far better network and organisational structures than even the army. There are elements in every ‘qasba’ and every town, the intelligence providers, backed by an army of lawyers, treasurers, ideologues, rabble rousers, stone throwers, drug addicts and of course terrorists. All of them survive on the additional income provided by the separatists. There has been enough money coming in to finance a plethora of overground workers, compensate families of terrorists, pay guides at the LoC, safe house owners and stone throwers on an everyday basis.

Money came from foreign sources into legitimate accounts, cash was drawn by cards from accounts opened and existing in Delhi and even more cash was available through gift packets on Pakistan’s national day, at the Pakistan high commission.

With the situation in south Kashmir having drastically changed, the government has finally acted. It is good that both parties of the J&K coalition government have supported the NIA’s initiative with arrest of seven separatist leaders. Details of their financial networks are bound to produce enough incriminating material to ensure that the leadership is sufficiently ineffective for long. Care must be taken to prevent VIP facilities and availability of communications to the leaders, otherwise the entire gamut of operations may be compromised.

Next should be curtailing of mosque power, for which the effective advice of moderate Muslim clerics from rest of India should definitely make a difference. In the interim the army and other security forces must continue their excellent run to prevent the resurgence of gun power in the Valley. The ‘whole of government’ approach must continue."
‘Decision to shift Congress MLAs to Karnataka was taken by them without interference of high command’,"Gujarat Congress president Bharat Solanki has accused BJP of misusing the income-tax department and other central agencies to harass the opposition party’s Gujarat MLAs ahead of crucial Rajya Sabha elections on August 8. Three seats are up for grabs between BJP president Amit Shah, information and broadcasting minister Smriti Irani, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel and Congress rebel-turned BJP candidate, Balwantsinh Rajput. He spoke to Rohit E David on why 44 Congress MLAs fled to Bengaluru where they are being kept in a private resort, IT raids on a Karnataka Congress minister and the upcoming elections in the state:

Is it right that Gujarat Congress MLAs fled to Bengaluru in fear? Or are they being kept against their will?

Our MLAs did not go to Bengaluru in fear, they went for security. BJP-ruled states, especially Gujarat, are not secure places. Our MLAs decided they wanted to be together in a safe place. After thinking about this for long, all of them decided to go to a Congress-ruled state. This decision to shift the MLAs to Karnataka was taken by themselves without any interference of the high command.

What is your reaction to the IT raids on one of your ministers in Karnataka? ​

It clearly shows BJP’s mindset. If BJP was so sure of winning the three Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat, why did they force Congress MLAs to resign? Congress had got enough votes with 57 MLAs. After resignations and defections were induced by threat and pressure, six of our MLAs resigned. BJP fielded one of our former MLAs Balwantsinh Rajput as a fourth candidate in the Rajya Sabha election. These IT raids definitely show vendetta, corruption and criminalisation of politics by BJP.

You have claimed that BJP is offering Rs 15 crore to each MLA. Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani has emphatically denied these charges. Can you substantiate these charges?

The figures can vary from Rs 5 to 15 crore. This is absolutely true. Else why would any Congress MLA resign? In Gujarat there is a two-party system. These MLAs had put their career at stake. If they cross-vote they would not be able to contest for the next six years.

Political observers say you had a rivalry with Shankersinh Vaghela who recently left Congress? Is this the reason he left?

I don’t have rivalry with anyone. I was made state Congress president by Sonia Gandhi ji. Initially, I was reluctant to become the state president but she wanted me to be at the helm of affairs in Gujarat. I don’t know why all of a sudden Vaghela ji thought of leaving the party. He raised a few issues including the demand to make him the chief ministerial candidate and to remove me as the state president.

What has been the political impact of Vaghela leaving Congress? Do you have hope of him coming back?

Well, you will see in the 2017 elections. We will win the elections and come to power. Shankersinh Vaghela coming back to the Congress is out of question. When he was the state president, Congress got minimum seats in the assembly.

Is Congress going to tie up with Hardik Patel in the coming elections?

It is not a question of having an alliance. It is a question of supporting electoral politics of Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakore. They are all anti-BJP. It is a natural course of action to be getting together and removing one of the worst governments ever in Gujarat.

It has been said that when Gujarat is facing floods, Congress MLAs are enjoying themselves in a resort outside the state. Your response?

We did not enjoy anything. The MLAs were forced to get together and leave for Bengaluru. Before leaving, all MLAs were working in the field, where floods had struck the state. There was a lady MLA who had gone to Bengaluru though her son was admitted in the hospital.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi not heading the state during the coming assembly elections, is Congress more confident of winning now?

The leadership of BJP is very poor. Vijay Rupani and the state BJP president are weak leaders. This is the reason why the PM had to rush to Gujarat and send Amit Shah to save the sinking boat.

What do you have to say about cross voting during presidential elections?

There was no cross voting from the Congress side.

Is Ahmed Patel going to win the Rajya Sabha election?

He is definitely going to win. There is no question of him losing. Whoever is with us, will stand strong. I feel that Smriti Irani may lose in the Rajya Sabha election."
A Hoax Call Made Punjab Teenager Believe That Google Hired Him At Rs 1.44 Cr Per Annum Salary,"The family of Harshit Sharma, a 16-year-old school student from Chandigarh who made headlines a couple of days ago after it was reported that the teenager had been offered a graphic designer job in Google said he has been left devastated after it emerged that the job was a hoax.

According to his mother Bharti Sharma, Harshit had fallen victim to a hoax phone call which claimed that he had been selected for a ‘graphic artist’ job in Google.

“Harshit got a phone call. We did not believe it at first. I kept telling him it could be a hoax. He shared the information with his school principal, who further released a press note, which led to media coverage,” Bharti told Hindustan Times.

BCCL/ File

According to report ever since Google officially denied hiring Harshit, the teenager has traumatised and is hospitalised.

The family said it was the school authorities that issued a press release and not them.

Indra Beniwal, the principal of the Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS) where Harshit was a student said the family has admitted that their son has made a mistake.

""Harshit's parents have accepted that their son has committed a mistake (by claiming to have been selected by Google),"" Ms Beniwal said.

She added that the school had issued the press release based on documents Harshit had provided.

Harshit's parents however said he had only told the principal about the call and did not provide any documents.

However another teacher Deep Kiran calimed that Harshit had in fact forwarded his offer letter to her on WhatsApp.

He told me he had applied to Google online and was selected. He told me would be leaving for US in the next few days,” she told the New Indian Express.

Following the embarrassing episode, the Chandigarh administration has ordered a probe into the matter and sought a report from the school.

Lights! Camera! Crisis! Advancing technology and borderline government hostility bring bure din to Bollywood,"Indians associate Bollywood, or the Hindi film industry, with glamour, big money, stardom, entertainment and beautiful people. It is seen as a wonderful place to be, perhaps because of the happy feelings we get when we watch Bollywood films. Therefore it becomes unthinkable to imagine this – Bollywood is in the middle of a major crisis.

Yes, we had a Baahubali 2 this year. It made people come to the theatres like never before. Yes, Dangal did extraordinarily well. Yes, Hindi Medium and Lipstick Under My Burkha found an audience despite low budgets. However, these few examples don’t give you the complete picture. Most trade analysts are stunned at how low collections have been for many big budget, well reviewed films.

Sure, perhaps the films lacked something in content. However, collections and footfalls have dropped to below 2013 levels for similar genre/ reviews/ likeability of the film. Films like Rangoon, Jagga Jasoos and Raabta, were made on a huge scale and with a novel concept. They found it difficult to garner even a third of the expected business to make the films reach breakeven point for their distributors.

New generation rom-coms like Ok Jaanu, Meri Pyaari Bindu and Noor struggled to reach a box office total of Rs 50 crore for the three films put together, something a single rom-com would easily achieve on its own a few years ago. Even Salman Khan starrer Tubelight struggled, with a Rs 125 crore box office take compared to over Rs 300 crore collections for his previous few films.

So, film collections on the whole are dropping. A few good films, when liked, get tremendous positive word of mouth with terrific velocity thanks to social media. This leads to a great success like Baahubali 2. Thirdly, if a film is not liked as much, or liked but not considered ‘must watch’, people are not interested to watch it.

Fourthly, only two kinds of films still seem to work – high spectacle or high concept. High spectacle films offer a visual experience that only a big screen can offer, say The Avengers movie or Baahubali. A high concept film offers a fresh take on a relevant subject, making a section of people want to watch it. Everything else is passé. People just don’t ‘need’ to watch movies anymore.

Finally, if you ask an average Indian why they watch movies, they will say it is for ‘time pass’. Well, this ‘time pass’ is already happening on the mobile phone now, for free or at a fraction of the cost of the movie ticket. YouTube recently reported it has 150 crore monthly viewers, with each viewer spending an hour a day on the site on an average. Facebook users, at 200 crore, watch tonnes of videos all day long. There are many other digital content apps making rapid inroads in India. Then, why go to the theatres to watch movies?

Making things worse is rampant piracy and no real will from the authorities to eliminate it. This is mainly due to our government’s borderline hostile attitude towards Bollywood, mistakenly seen as an industry of rich, entitled people (due to a tiny number of visible stars). We also have regulations that tax Bollywood films more than any other form of content – films attract a higher GST rate than other content.

The poor infrastructure in cities that makes getting to a theatre a harrowing, pot-hole filled experience where one is stuck in traffic jams, also hinders ticket sales. It’s simpler to just stream content directly on your phone or TV.

Of course, some of the blame lies with Bollywood as well. There’s been little cost evolution with advancing technology. Films are still shot expensively, using giant cameras and light setups. Stars, even those who are not attracting audiences, charge way more than they bring in. Many younger actors have entourages on set that cost several lakhs per day.

As a result, a shoot day in Mumbai could easily cost Rs 20 lakh. A film with an average budget may need 80 such days! Compare this to a stand up comic video you liked on Facebook, which was probably shot for a few lakhs at the most. Today, even inexpensive cellphones offer 4K resolution recording capability.

News channels have dumped big camera setups for mobile phone journalism. Also, plenty of acting talent in the digital world is ready to work without the umbrella-holding, ego-boosting entourage. How does Bollywood ever expect to compete? Costs need to go down all across by at least 50%.

The film industry can no longer rely on entry barriers in content distribution. Earlier, only films had the marketing budgets and the screens to show their content, with television being the only competition to a certain extent. Today, distribution barriers are all but gone. Now, anyone with a cellphone is both a content creator as well as a content distributor while of course continuing to be a content consumer.

In this ‘new’ normal Bollywood needs to wake up, revise content and reduce both costs and egos at the same time. With better taxation structures and a firm hand on piracy, government needs to support an industry that directly and indirectly hires millions. One hopes Bollywood will evolve and we will create better and cheaper content to keep our film industry alive for the next several generations. Hopefully, picture abhi baaki hai mere dost!"
Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

Why having a 2-pizza team helps,"Work is increasingly becoming complex. The days of the lone genius are over. While Tim Berners Lee is given credit for inventing the World Wide Web, we often forget the contributions of Robert Callieau and the several thousands of people who have continuously worked to shape the web to its present reality.

Scientific progress is usually collaborative by its very nature. While Steve Jobs gets the limelight as the one person who gave us the iPhone a decade ago, it was the collective work of several people who had to work together to make it happen. The designers of the hardware worked with the supply chain people to procure the various components. The Marketing team had to create the ads that made us sit up and take notice. The Human Resources teams deserve credit for putting together the right team.

2-Pizza teams

Jeff Bezos made history this week when he surged past Bill Gates as the richest man on earth for a short while. Bezos had a net worth of over $89 billion when markets closed, while Gates was ahead by a billion dollars. I have no doubt that Bezos will go past Gates (for one Gates is giving away his wealth) very soon.

Amazon has grown from being an online book seller, which is where it all began 22 years back to a pot-pourri of businesses. From cloud computing, movies, music, food, AI and space shuttles, Bezos is doing it all. Apple may have been the past, Amazon is definitely the future. How does Bezos do this? While most businesses become bureaucratic and sloppy as they grow in size, Bezos has kept the 2 pizza rule to keep the behemoth nimble. He keeps the team size to no more than 6-7 people.

Amazon’s rise has led to the creation of Death by Amazon Index, which tracks the performance of the companies affected by the rise of Amazon. Those 54 companies include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart. As organizations grow, the rumor mills become far more reliable sources of information than the formal communication. The employees get far more reliable updates from the business press than their own managers. It slows down the organization far more seriously than we realize.

Quality of communication

As the number of members of a group increases, the number of links that need to be managed to keep the messages from getting tangled increases. Mathematically speaking the number of links between members in a group will be n(n-1)/2. If there are 5 people (ie n=5) in a team, there are 10 possible links to be managed. With 10 people, that number goes up to 45.

As start-ups add people to their payroll, they forget how to manage the number of communication links. Each time the business pivots, the leaders must explain the rationale to the entire organization and answer all the questions the team members may have. This is where communication breaks down. To manage time zone differences and to decentralize the process, founders will often leave the dissemination to the next level of leaders. Some leaders inevitably do not communicate the message in a timely manner. That is where cynicism and disillusionment happens.

Team members often have to invite their managers and senior leaders to review and set direction. Anyone who has tried to call for a meeting with a few senior leaders knows the nightmare of trying to match calendars. Even when the leaders manage to join the meeting, they are distracted by the messages and phone calls. Small empowered teams can really speed up things.

The 54 companies listed in the Death by Amazon index would do well to start creating 2-Pizza teams. Even if you are not one of the 54 companies listed, it may be a good idea to start trimming the team size.

Improves execution

Organizing the business in teams of 5-6 people, keeps bureaucracy at bay. It gives the teams a chance to create close bonds. Between five people, it is easy to coordinate meetings and develop a sense of ownership. The core team can keep inviting additional people as and when needed. But the 2-Pizza team can stay nimble enough to see the project through.

A smaller team helps improve execution. Amazon’s stock has risen more than 36 percent this year. If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 — and had held onto your shares — that money would be worth $83,000 today. In real terms it would be $61,000. Maybe 2-Pizza teams are effective after all."
"Making A Strong Point On Racism, Nawazuddin Siddiqui Reminds Us Why He Can Never Be 'Unusual'","During his days as a junior artiste in showbiz, he was told he can’t be cast as they would need “extra light” to make him “visible”. In just a few years of being active in the Indian film industry, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has proved that he is true and honest to his craft and he definitely is here to say.

While he can easily pull off any film with Khans without getting sidelined, he can pull off films like Haraamkhor, Raman Raghav, and Badlapur too.

After struggling for more than a decade, Nawaz has finally got his due and he deserved every bit of it. Just a few days ago, Nawazuddin was in middle of the whole racism fiasco and Bollywood chose to stand up for the actor.

Pinterest

Recently in an interview with IANS, Nawazuddin decided to raise some valid points. Expressing why he feels he represents the country’s “majority” with his dark skin, he spoke about his struggling days and said,

Pinterest

“In those days, I used to work on a daily basis for television shows as a junior artiste. Because of my brown complexion, people used to say, ‘We can’t take you… we have to put extra light to make you visible, you are dark and we don’t have time.’ Even after 12 years, nothing much has changed. People call me ‘unusual’. They say that a dark skinned man is too unusual to become a hero of a mainstream film.”

Recalling a racist tweet that he had called out, he said,

Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. — Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@Nawazuddin_S) July 17, 2017

“In our country, a majority of the population have dark skin complexion. Even I have dark complexion, which means I represent the majority. I want to ask, how am I the ‘unusual’ when I represent the maximum.""

That's a point well made, Nawaz.

Inputs From Reuters"
Sustaining the sunrise in India’s solar industry,"The 28th report of the parliamentary standing committee on energy reviewing the National Solar Mission has flagged several areas of concern. A target to generate 100GW of solar energy has been set for 2022, of which 60GW will come from large and medium scale solar projects and the remaining 40GW from rooftop solar projects. However, only 663 MW of rooftop solar projects have been installed. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy blamed it on multiple approval processes, the reluctance of DISCOMs to set up metering applications at the customer’s ( who now also becomes a power producer) end, and lack of consistency in subsidies and regulations.

The report also raises concerns about whether the falling solar tariffs, which are now Rs.2.44/kWh are sustainable and whether companies are sacrificing returns on investment to corner a larger market share. In 2010, bids ranged between Rs.10-12/kWh which fell to Rs.6-8/kWh in 2014 and has sharply fallen by over 50 per cent in the past one year. If banks pull the plug on funding, or if discoms renege from their power purchase commitments, or if the costs of operation and maintenance make the projects unviable these can hurt India’s fledgeling solar industry.

Interestingly, the committee maintains equanimity on the controversial question of dumping by Chinese SPV manufacturers. It restricts itself to stating that an anti-dumping duty should be imposed on poor quality imported materials. The reality is that the low-cost Chinese imports are fuelling India’s impressive solar surge in recent years. India added 5.5 GW of solar capacity in 2016 and is reportedly poised to add 9 GW in 2017. This is in contrast to a mere 945 MW added in 2013-14 when solar module costs were 58-60 cents/watt as against 16 cents/watts now. Imports account for 85 per cent of India’s needs.

The committee has suggested that the MNRE put more emphasis on setting up large scale manufacturing solar photo cell manufacturing hubs. They have also sought zero excise duty exemption and Zero import duty on raw materials. Considering that the WTO has restrained the government from placing restrictions on power projects that would have forced them to purchase only indigenous SPV modules, the government certainly needs to focus on capacity building and better designing of subsidies.

India’s SPV cell imports are to the tune of $5 billion while exports are just in the order of a few ten million dollars. There is no reason why India cannot bridge the gap in a few years time. For the moment it must use the cheap imports to build solar capacity but increasingly rely on domestic industry to meet future demand.

The report is scathing in its criticism of various government arms including the PSUs for not doing enough to build solar capacity. PSUs were supposed to add 10 GW of rooftop solar capacity by 2022 but are yet to achieve even a tenth of that capacity. With NABARD help only 1.27 lakh solar pumps have been installed against a target of 10 lakh. Against a target of installing 3 lakh streetlights in 169 constituencies spread across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Assam by 2018, only 9,400 were installed.

The committee visualizes an investment requirement of Rs.5 lakh crore for meeting the 100 GW target. But the government, by its own admission, has left it to the private sector to mop up the investment while it provides various forms of assistance, financial, administrative, and technical. The committee wants the government to play a more “proactive” role. The danger of the solar industry suffering the same problems that have plagued the power and telecom sector cannot be ruled out.

The growth of solar is critical in India’s ability to combat climate change and bring development to more people. It also has the potential to create jobs. Power minister Piyush Goyal has been among the better performing ministers in the government. Much of what is in the standing committee report contains will already be known to him. But can he address the significant challenges and the shortcomings that the report flags?"
CA-ACA pay dispute ends; players to receive upto 30% of revenue,"END OF PAY DISPUTE

CA-ACA pay dispute ends; players to receive upto 30% of revenue

As a result of the deal struck by Sutherland and Nicholson, the proposed tours of Bangladesh, India and the Ashes series will go ahead as planned © Getty

Cricket Australia and Australian Cricketers' Association brokered a new pay deal to bring to an end the bitter pay dispute between the two warring parties. As per the new MoU, the players - both male and female - will receive upto 30% of the agreed revenue, which is expected to be upto $500 million in the next five years.

As a result of the deal struck by CA chief James Sutherland and his ACA counterpart Alistair Nicholson, the proposed tours of Bangladesh, India and the Ashes series to be played at home will go ahead as planned.

""In announcing this agreement, we are restoring certainty, beginning to repair relationships, especially with the fans,"" Sutherland said on Thursday (August 3). ""We want the focus to be back on cricket. We have got a huge summer of cricket to look forward to, including Ashes cricket for both our men and women. I'm very confident that by the time the first ball is bowled this summer, all of this will be well and truly behind us. We know with the ticket sales that there is great anticipation about the Ashes series ahead, including from many advances bookings from the thousands of visitors from UK.

""In the meantime, I'm very pleased to say that the Bangladesh tour is preceding with the pre-tour camp scheduled in Darwin next week, and the team heading off to Bangladesh two weeks later, followed by our limited overs tour of India followed by the summer of cricket here,"" he said.

Another big breakthrough in the new agreement is the pay equity between the men and women players, which ACA chief Nicholson described as the ""highest pay-rise in women's team sport in Australia."" The ACA will conduct a player's vote in the next 24 hours on the proposed revenue model, the outcome of which they believe will be positive.

Among the key points of the new Heads of Agreement, as stated by Nicholson, include a gender-equity, revenue sharing model in which the players will share 30% of the agreed revenue, consisting of 27.5% of the forecast revenue streams and a 2.5% performance pool. This is estimated to be up to $500 million in the next five-year period.

For any over-revenue forecast, the maintenance of the adjustment ledger will continue. All domestic and international - male and female player - will share this revenue, while it was also announced that an amount of nearly $25 million will flow directly to the development of grassroots from the fund if the forecast is achieved.

After marathon discussions over the last few days, the two sides settled on various key aspects related to payments to the players and funding of grassroots cricket. In June, the negotiations between the two sides had broken down, with the previous MoU expiring at midnight on Friday (June 30), leaving 230 Australian cricketers officially unemployed. These cricketers will now receive back pay after further negotiations, which will continue for the next four to six weeks.

The deadlock between the two parties, which lasted for 10 months, resulted in Australia A's tour to South Africa being cancelled. Terming it as a shame, Sutherland said ""not a lot of cricket was lost"" apart from that while admitting that the relationship between players and the board was strained due to the tussle.

In March this year, CA's proposal sought to overhaul the fixed revenue percentage model that was the core of the MoU since 1998, with players being provided a fixed share of around a quarter of cricket's revenue. CA's initial deal in March had recommended salary hikes for men and women cricketers. However, the board had taken off a clause from players' agreements that had 'guaranteed' them a percentage of the board's revenue.

This offer was declined by the ACA, and they had also rejected a further amended pay plan. The players' association had pointed out that overhauling the MoU would result in them being downgraded from ""partners in the game to paid employees"".

"Exclusive: Without Mincing His Words, Amit Sadh Says Bollywood Is Currently Making Shit Films","Amit Sadh got our hearts racing for the very first time with his stint in Kyun Hota Hai Pyarrr, where he portrayed the character of Aditya and then became even more famous with Bigg Boss season 1.

Twitter/Amit Sadh

Since then, there has been no looking back for Amit Sadh. Whether it was his much-publicised affair with actress Neeru Bajwa or his Bollywood debut with Kai Po Che, he always knew how to make headlines.

Speaking exclusively to Indiatimes, the 36-year-old talks about the shit movies Bollywood is making, the brief lull in his career and his take on nepotism.

There is no terminology like a ''lull''

Twitter/Amit Sadh

Amit Sadh, who was seen in blockbusters like Sultan and Sarkar 3 feels there is nothing called as lull. The actor says there is no such terminology.

Speaking about his own career graph, Amit said, “I was working on my career. People label you down and out if your movies are not coming. People forget you but I am still grateful to everyone for giving me this beautiful career. All this while, I was working on myself, my roles and taking time to choose the right films. I wake up and thank god for this beautiful life"".

People crying over Nepotism should really calm down

On asking whose side is he on (Karan Johar or Kangana Ranaut), Amit said, ""People talking the most about nepotism should totally take a break. Please don’t cry foul and be grateful for what you have. I have nothing to say to anyone. I personally feel there are ample opportunities and everyone has work. People should be thankful for so much love. Ýou need to have talent to last long especially in a creative field like ours. And at the end of the day, we are all outsiders.""

So is he supporting the so called movie mafia aka KJo?

Twitter/Amit Sadh

""I am a very strong man and I don’t need to take stands or be a part of any debate. I respect both Kangana and Karan Johar and their views. Both of them are my seniors and I love their craft.""

According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."
Quick-footed Pujara outwits Sri Lanka's spin,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Quick-footed Pujara outwits Sri Lanka's spin

Vishaal Loganathan • Last updated on Thu, 03 Aug, 2017, 07:43 PM

Pujara came down the track 38 times for 33 runs on the first day © AFP

Cheteshwar Pujara is a batsman straight out of the old book. He plays for time, extremely content blocking deliveries away, patiently waiting for his chance to score. His currency is to tire the bowlers, and frustrate them into eventually throwing their plans away. His boundaries come through textbook shots, and sweeps, reverse-sweeps and scoops hardly find a mention in his book. He is the prime candidate for a battle of attrition, the kind of player you choose when you needed someone to bat for your life. Because Pujara, every time he bats, he does it like it could be the last time he will do the thing he loves most.

On the face of it, Pujara's game seems very simple. Keep out the good balls and hit the bad ones. But behind Pujara's often expressionless face, there is a mind that always seems to be ticking. He doesn't just spend his time defying the opposition, he also deflates them by showing them that their plans are useless, their intricate fields are ineffective, their lines and lengths are not right, their bowlers are amateurs he is using to gain more match practice. Once Pujara sets in, stopping him scoring almost becomes impossible. He becomes both the immovable object and the unstoppable force. The key to that is his superb footwork.

On a pitch that was taking a bit of turn, and against a team that had packed itself with three specialist spinners and a part-time one, Pujara's footwork was going to be critical. The first and third balls he faced, he played off the outside of the bat. Off the seventh ball, he was down the track and countering Perera, who was getting some decent drift and turn. That was the start of a masterful innings that remained undefeated by the time stumps were called on the opening day of the second Test against Sri Lanka.

Unlike most batsmen, Pujara uses his feet to not only score, but also defend or rotate strike. His favourite is the clip off the pads, and he almost never hits over the top. Just the simplicity of his game puts bowlers off their mark. And it was all too evident as Pujara's composed 128 in his 50th Test helped India to a commanding position by the end of day's play.

Pujara's propensity to coming down the track doesn't mean he is predictable. He picks lengths really early, and reads the field perfectly. He places almost the same delivery either straight down, towards mid-wicket of whips it much squarer. When the line is outside off, he hits it to the cover fence.

Such brilliance leaves the bowlers searching for answers. On Thursday, Sri Lanka tried to arrest his most productive shot by packing the leg side field. Off the 14th ball he faced, he came down and got his first boundary, and soon he had a six-man legside field to try and penetrate. Pujara would often come down the track, but his clip often found one of the four fielders on the legside. He was even forced to use the sweep on a couple of occasions to find that single.

Pujara got himself to 12 off 34 balls, but couldn't find another run for the next 30 deliveries. This could have rattled a lot of other players, but Pujara has been built by different bricks. In the second session, he batted like a man possessed.

He continued to use his feet to the spinners, getting both Malinda Pushpakumara and Dilruwan Perera to bowl to his strengths. Soon after a shimmy down the wicket, Pujara would hang back to play the cut or the pull, and when the bowler erred on the shorter side, he cashed in big time. Against the experience of Herath, he was understandably more watchful.

In all, Pujara came down the track to the spinners 38 times during his unbeaten innings on Thursday. Twenty three times, he was down trying to put the offspin of Perera and Dhananjaya de Silva off their lengths, while 15 times he came down to the left arm of Pushpakumara and Herath. He made 33 runs off the 38 times he came down, but not all were used as sun-scoring options. At least six times, he was happy to tap the ball back to the bowler.

This is very much in line with how Pujara plays his cricket. According to CricViz, Pujara had, before this game, come down the track 611 times to the spinners and scored 508 runs, with a strike rate of 83+ and an average of 254. Those staggering numbers should give the opposition the chance to plan against him, but Pujara is able to still consistently churn out the runs coming down the track.

After a sedate first session, he blasted the spinners in the second. From 14 off 58, he raced to 89 off 140 - 75 runs in 82 balls. He had done his work in the first session, and now the spinners, vary of his charge, often dropped the ball short. Pujara gleefully gobbled them up.

""We were probably a fraction short on that wicket. The wicket is very slow and once the ball becomes you don't have many weapons as compared to harder ball. We were a bit short. We don't have to [analyse] with the TV to say that. We know Pujara scores on the leg-side. That's what he has done all his career. We were little bit guilty in not getting the ball into other areas and bowling to his strengths. But as I said, that's Test match cricket and that's why he is a quality cricketer,"" Sri Lanka's current coach Nic Pothas said at the end of the day.

By the end of day's play, Pujara had amassed 128 runs in 225 deliveries, and a bulk of them had come thanks to the magic in his footwork. For all that pretty footwork, though, it's a surprise that his running between the wicket fails him often. But India will not complain that much. Not when he's batting the way he's batting.

"US Revises Immigration Policy Favouring English Speaking Highly Qualified And High Earners, And That Is Good News For Indians","President Donald Trump announced his support for a legislation that would cut in half the number legal immigrants allowed into the US while moving to a ""merit-based"" system favouring English-speaking skilled workers for residency cards.

bccl/representational image

If passed by the Congress and signed into law, the legislation titled the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act could benefit highly-educated and technology professionals from countries like India.

The RAISE Act would scrap the current lottery system to get into the US and instead institute a points-based system for earning a green card. Factors that would be taken into account include English language skills, education, high- paying job offers and age.

""The RAISE Act will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to nationals from other countries. Green Cards provide permanent residency, work authorisation, and fast track to citizenship,"" Trump said at a White House event to announce his support to the RAISE Act.

BCCL/Representational Image

This competitive application process will favour applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families, and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy, he said, adding that the RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare, and protects US workers from being displaced.

""That's a very big thing. They're not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. That doesn't happen under the RAISE Act. They can't do that. Crucially, the Green Card reforms in the RAISE Act will give American workers a pay raise by reducing unskilled immigration,"" he said.

The RAISE Act will be re-orienting Green Card system towards people who can speak English, who have high degrees of educational attainment, who have a job offer that pays more, and a typical job in their local economy, who are going to create a new business, and who are outstanding in their field around the world.

Senator Perdue said the current system does not work. ""It keeps America from being competitive, and it does not meet the needs of the economy today,"" he said.

""Today we bring in 1.1 million legal immigrants a year. Over 50 per cent of our households of legal immigrants today participate in our social welfare system. Right now, only one 1 out of 15 immigrants who come into our country come in with skills that are employable. We've got to change that,"" he said.

BCCL/representational image

Perdue said he looked at the at best practices. ""We looked at countries like Canada, Australia, and others. What we're introducing today is modeled on the current Canadian and Australian systems. It's pro-worker, it's pro-growth, and it's been proven to work. Both have been extremely successful in attracting highly skilled workers to those countries,"" the Senator said.

""We can all agree that the goals of our nation's immigration system should be to protect the interests of working Americans, including immigrants, and to welcome talented individuals who come here legally and want to work and make a better life for themselves. Our current system makes it virtually impossible for them to do that,"" said the Senator.

According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the higher entry standards established in this proposal will allow authorities to do a more thorough job reviewing applicants for entry, therefore protecting the security of the US homeland.

The additional time spent on vetting each application as a result of this legislation will also ensure that each application serves the national interest, he observed.

"IBM Sets A Record, Storing 201 Gigabits Of Data In A Square Inch Of A New Type Of Magnetic Tape","The days are long past when we’ve had to rely on magnetic tapes for storage. Instead, today we’re even moving past flash storage and into cloud storage for our everyday use. But there’s been a recent development that could keep tape storage somewhat relevant for awhile longer.

IBM Research’s team have just set a new record for storing 201 Gigabits (Gb) of data in a single square inch of a Sony’s new prototype “sputtered magnetic tape”.

The tape has been made more efficient by painting on several thin layers of liquid metal barium ferrite. This takes place in a process similar to how integrated circuits are made. The improvement is significant, considering Sony’s previous unsputtered tape was able to store just 123 Gb per square inch in 2015.

What this new record basically means is that IBM says it can store 330 TB of uncompressed data on a single cartridge that could sit in the palm of your hand. That’s 300 million books stored in something smaller than your wallet.

The reason this is important is because magnetic tape is much cheaper to produce than disks, and it’s more enduring than even flash storage. It’s because of this that tape is the preferred method for storing video archives in movie studios, or for saving massive troves of backup records in financial institutions.

But cloud storage companies, Google and Amazon included, claim that their systems offer faster and easier access to data, not to mention save the infrastructure needed to safely record and store data on magnetic tapes. Thanks to this new development, IBM now claims that its users can continue to rely on tape storage for the next 10 years.

“This really demonstrates the potential to continue scaling tape technology, basically at historical rates of doubling the capacity every two years, at least for the next 10 years,” IBM Research's Dr Mark Lantz said.

Pandey stars in India A's tight final-over finish

Having lost their campaign opener at the hands of hosts South Africa A, India A took a different route in their Thursday (August 3) clash when they opted to bowl at LC de Villiers Oval in Pretoria. The hosts began poorly before staging a strong recovery to post 266, which India A chased down, albeit with hiccups towards the end, winning it by one wicket with just two deliveries to spare.

Shardul Thakur vindicated skipper Manish Pandey's decision to bowl as he rocked South Africa early with two wickets, sending opener Reeza Hendricks and Jason Smith back into the hut inside the first five overs of play. The Proteas were not allowed to recover as in the fifth over, merely three deliveries after Smith had fallen, Mohammed Siraj removed Henry Davids for only 14. South Africa were tottering at 20 for 3. Just as it looked shambolic, wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen, who was joined in by No. 5 batsman and skipper Khaya Zondo, went on a counter attack. Zondo hit three fours and a six in his brief 26-ball stay at the crease before being dismissed by paceman Siddarth Kaul. The duo added 43 runs for the fourth wicket before Zondo departed, who was soon followed by the experienced Farhaan Behardien.

Klaseen dominated in the sixth wicket stand with Dwaine Pretorius as the latter could only contribute 17 to the 63-run partnership. As India A struggled to hold momentum, their bowling blew hot and cold to let the last but the most defining partnership to build. Willem Mulder, who walked in at No. 8, combined with Klaasen to add 111 runs which saw the lower-order batsman hit three sixes and three fours during his sprightly 66. In the meantime, Klaasen went onto register a ton before the hosts were bundled out for 266. Krunal Pandya broke the crucial stand while Thakur came back to wrap up the innings with his four-fer.

India A, in reply, were rocked early by Junior Dala's double strike that saw Shreyas Iyer and Vijay Shankar fall cheaply. Although Rishabh Pant, who walked in at number four, managed to get started with Sanju Samson, he fell for just 20 to leave the visitors' chase in dreariness. Skipper Pandey once again weathered the storm, hitting a six off Aaron Phangiso early in his innings. Samson appeared to be in fine touch as he hit sixes in back to back overs to celebrate his fifty.

Dala once again proved to be the man for his side as he broke the partnership in the first over of his comeback spell to send Samson back. India, much like their opponents, struggled to keep wickets intact at crucial junctures, losing them on either side of solid partnerships. The tourists were reduced to 184 for 6 in the 38th over and with 83 more needed to win, they found two key partnerships for the seventh and eighth wicket.

While Chahal performed the second fiddle's role very well, all-rounder Krunal hit three fours and a six in his quickfire 15-ball 25. Just as he was about to seal the chase for India A without any more hassles, Tabraiz Shamsi picked up his third wicket to remove Krunal off the final ball of the 48th over. When Pandey picked up a single off the second ball of the 49th over to hand Kaul the strike, Phangiso seized the moment for his side by removing the No. 10 batsman.

The match went right down to the wire as the last man in, Siraj, picked up a single off his second ball to hand the strike back to the skipper. Pandey levelled the scores with a couple off the last ball of the penultimate over and with Siraj on strike, chances of a tie were imminent. However, the last man survived four deliveries of the wrecker-in-chief Dala and ensured India A crossed the line with two balls to spare. Pandey remained unbeaten at the other end with 93 runs to his credit.

With this win, India A went to the top of the table with three wins, having played a game more than the hosts, who have two wins from three games. Afghanistan A have been winless thus far.

Brief Scores: South Africa A 266 all-out in 48.2 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 127, Willem Mulder 66; Shardul Thakur 4-35, Siddarth Kaul 3-41) lost to India A 267/9 in 49.4 overs (Manish Pandey 93*, Sanju Samson 68; Tabraiz Shamsi 3-55, Junior Dala 3-56) by one wicket.

Researchers Are Using Satellite Images To Help Locate And Shut Down Slave Labour Camps In India,"Researchers in England believe they can help crack down on modern day slavery in India by using satellite imagery to spot these hubs of activity.

Reuters

A team of geospatial experts at the University of Nottingham are using images pulled from Google Maps to locate brick kilns in northern India, labour sites notorious for their use of slave labour especially children.

These experts have teams of volunteers poring over hundreds of satellite images, in an effort to locate these slave labour camps and report them to authorities. “The key thing at the moment is to get those statistics right and to get the locations of the brick kilns sorted,” Dr Doreen Boyd, co-researcher on the 'Slavery from Space' project, told Reuters. “There are certainly activists on the ground that will help us in terms of getting the statistics and the locations of these brick kilns to (government) officials.”

The team believes these satellite images will help locate sites that are remote or otherwise go unnoticed by authorities.

“But there are other, more pressing challenges like tackling problematic practices including withheld wages, lack of transparent accounting,... no enforcement of existing labour laws,” Jakub Sobik, a spokesman for the London-based NGO Anti-Slavery said. Still, using this system could do wonders for the effort, and possibly change the lives of millions of people in India.

There are signs that household budgets are going to be under more stress as wholesale price of onions at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, last week hit a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 a quintal. The price of these two items serves as a barometer and recent trends are worrisome.

Price spikes are not uncommon. What makes the current situation unusual is that it comes at a time of normal monsoon and soon after farmers were gutted on account of a post-demonetisation collapse in prices. A cycle where farmers and consumers are stressed by turn is a sign of fundamental problems. At the same time a bird’s eye view shows that fruits and vegetables are where farmers are putting more effort on the heels of changing consumption patterns. Consequently, despite two of the last four years having deficient rainfall, production has risen steadily. Even area under cultivation increased and reached 24.92 million hectares last year.

Despite positive trends, if neither farmers nor consumers are satisfied, it is on account of factors under the control of policy makers and some beyond them. Sharp swings in climatic patterns have increased in the recent past, which makes agriculture a riskier proposition. Centre and states worsen this situation with an uncertain policy environment. The cumulative impact is that farmers get garbled price signals, which leads to oscillation between glut and shortage. Fixing this problem has to start with governments letting price become the primary signal for sowing, then keeping the economic environment stable for farmers.

A stable environment has to be complemented with two other steps. A start has been made by linking 455 markets of 13 states through an online marketplace, with more states expected to follow. This is an important step in breaking the hold of wholesale cartels. But it needs follow up in the form of superior infrastructure. Harvest and post-harvest losses in vegetables are estimated to be upto 12.44% of production. India needs to urgently enhance its cold storage infrastructure by providing private sector with better investment incentives. It is entirely possible to end the cycle of gluts and shortages if we get this policy framework right."
IIT Bombay Is Testing The Future Of Smart Classrooms With Exams Conducted On A Smartphone App,"We all know IITs are the pinnacle of technical education and research in the country.

So it's no surprise when you hear that IIT Bombay is experimenting with realizing the future of smart, digital classrooms in India. By slapping an in-house developed smart exam app with seamless wireless Internet connectivity throughout its classrooms and campus.

REUTERS

By collaborating with Mojo Networks, a service that offers cloud-based Wi-Fi management tools, IIT Bombay is now able to provide reliable W-iFi experience in halls to drive its smart classrooms initiative.

The wireless performance has helped in the successful deployment of SAFE (Smart Authenticated Fast Exams), a smartphone app-based system for conducting exams in classrooms, created by professors & student researchers of IIT Bombay.

SAFE leverages students' smart devices to conduct objective exams in a proctored setting.

IIT Bombay's SAFE app

SAFE is an outcome of over two years of R&D, and has gone through multiple rounds of refinements based on feedback from real deployment and use in classrooms.

SAFE is easy to operate and most importantly, it is safe: it employs a host of mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the exam, by restricting the use of the smart device for the intended purpose, for the duration of the SAFE exam. Another unique advantage of SAFE is that it's real time: after taking the quiz, the instructor is able to instantly view the consolidated marklist. This function enables students to get real-time feedback from the professor thereby helping them focus better on learning, especially in large classes.

On WiFi-enabled smart classrooms, Prof. Bhaskaran Raman of IIT Bombay opined: “Students should be able to collaborate with one another, and teachers should be able to interact better with students, get feedback on their understanding, and also conduct exams easily. The vision of the smart classroom is critically dependent on availability of a highly reliable and high performance Wi-Fi solution.”

"'Hindus Are Thugs Who Killed Muslims', That Is What Pakistan Is Teaching Its Next Generation","Pakistani high school student Noman Afzal knows “traitorous” Hindus are to blame for the bloodshed that erupted when British India split into two nations 70 years ago. His history textbook tells him so.

ap

Students across the border in India are taught a starkly different version of events, the result of a decades-long effort by the nuclear-armed rivals to shape and control history to their own nationalistic narrative.

The official unwillingness to confront the bitter legacy of Partition -- and the skewed portrayals being peddled in classrooms from New Delhi to Karachi -- is hindering any hope of reconciliation between the arch-rivals, experts say.

August marks 70 years since the subcontinent was divided into two independent states -- Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan -- and millions were uprooted in one of the largest mass migrations in history.

An untold number of people -- some estimates say up two million -- died in the savage violence that followed, as Hindus and Muslims fleeing for their new homelands turned on one another, raping and butchering in genocidal retribution.

The carnage sowed the seeds for the acrimony that prevails today between India and Pakistan, and generations later this defining moment in the subcontinent’s history is still polarised by nationalism and rancour.

In a government-approved grade five history textbook used in schools in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province, Hindus are described as “thugs” who “massacred Muslims, confiscated their property, and forced them to leave India”.

“They looked down upon us, that is why we created Pakistan,” said 17-year-old Afzal from Pakistan’s Punjab province, reeling off a stock answer from his history textbook.

On the other side of the border, Mumbai schoolboy Triaksh Mitra learned how Mahatma Gandhi fought for a unified India free from British subjugation while the Muslim League -- the political party led by Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah -- sided with the colonial rulers to carve out their own nation.

“But what they hadn’t really told us was the Muslim side of it,” the 15-year-old said of his Partition studies.

The chapters on Gandhi are a striking example of the gap between how Partition is portrayed on either side of the border. In Pakistan, his contribution to the struggle for independence is hardly mentioned, whereas in India he is hailed as an “one-man army”.

History teacher Aashish Dhakaan, who works in a high school in India’s Gujarat, acknowledged that the creation of the Muslim League was popularly upheld as “self reliance and liberty” in Pakistan, and the folly of “gullible Muslims” in India.

“In our history we won the war, and in their history textbooks, they won the war,” said Dhakaan.

While the government-sanctioned curriculum on both sides of the border appear largely ossified to their version of history, one Pakistan-based group has been using games and popular culture to challenge students to think critically about their past.

Qasim Aslam’s History Project runs sessions in schools in India and Pakistan, inviting students to compare how Partition accounts are presented in the two countries’ textbooks.

“By the time they are 20, it is solidified and stays with them all their lives,” Aslam said of the one-sided history lessons proffered in schools.

Mumbai-based student Mitra attended one of these sessions in April.

“It helped me to take a different viewpoint into account and to form a more balanced notion,” Mitra said.

“If I know only one part, then it’s not the complete truth.”

Islamabad-based Pakistan studies professor Tariq Rehman said that correcting bias in the official syllabus “would take a change in foreign policy” between the two countries.

“Authorities (in Pakistan) don’t seem to be interested in making changes and question the antagonism against India,” he added.

But there are small signs of progress. The latest revision of the state history textbook in India includes graphic first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by Hindus, and asks students if the violence could be considered a holocaust.

A book of testimonies titled 'The Other Side of Silence' by Indian writer and Partition historian Urvashi Butalia is now also part of the high school syllabus in India.

Butalia said she is pleased that more people are trying to understand Partition beyond a nationalistic prism.

“It would have been impossible 20 years ago,” she said.

But outside the classroom, Butalia says there is little appetite for confronting hard truths about the past.

The author discovered a series of police reports of rapes and murders from 1947 that had been kept hidden because authorities feared “opening up a can of worms” if the horrifying accounts went public.

She also points to Humayan’s Tomb and Purana Qila -- two ancient monuments in New Delhi -- where thousands of Partition refugees sought sanctuary as the capital descended into chaos, noting there is no plaque at either site to remind the public of this troubled legacy.

“I do not say that silence is broken,” she added. “We could learn so much, basically learn never to repeat that history, but we don’t memorialise it in any way,” she warned."
Hariyal Teej: Why this reunion of Shiva & Adi-shakti is different from Shivratri,"6

Parvati's penance for Shiva

In this birth, she was successful in drawing out Lord Shiva from his extreme meditation and making him aware of her existence and manifestation. She herself went through strict penance to break Shiva's meditation. And, then he accepted her. His acceptance of Parvati is marked as the celebration of Teej in Hinduism."
Why India and Pakistan love each other,"India and Pakistan are soon going to celebrate their 70th birthday. The addition of a zero, an invention of the Asian subcontinent, makes birthdays a bit more special not just in Asia but also in Europe. The parties are fancier, louder, and more guests are invited in many European countries if you turn 70 than when you turned 69. So this is a special year. And both our countries will catch the attention of the international media.

The Economist has already published an article titled, “Why India and Pakistan hate each other”, to mark our 70th birthday. The article is fair and does mention that even though the population of India is six times that of Pakistan and its economy eight times as big, it has shown restraint and not given in to provocations from Pakistan.

Well, that is how an elder brother behaves. On the way back from school, when the younger brother throws his school bag and throws a fit, the elder brother behaves responsibly, hoping that when they get home he will say sorry and they will be friends again.

After 70 years of partition, an unnecessary partition, the peoples of Pakistan and India have to realize that the option of loving each other is better than of hating each other. The partition was based on a bogus premise: religion was more important than language. So one Punjab was divided into two, one went to Pakistan and became the most powerful state in the country, and the other remained in India. One Bengal was divided into two. One, which was the industrial center, remained in India and the more agrarian part of Bengal became Pakistan and later Bangladesh.

How naïve were those who thought that religion was more important than language. A month ago, I was listening to a programme in which a human-rights activist based in UK, Salil Tripathi, was invited. He mentioned that he was writing a book on Gujaratis, and I cannot wait to read that book. While giving an introduction to what he wanted to write, he mentioned that Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was better at Gujarati than at Urdu. Even though Salil Tripathi did not mention that, my guess is that Mahatma Gandhi was better at Gujarati than at Hindi. So both the leaders of Pakistan and India at that time were versatile in Gujarati. But they failed to understand that they had a lot in common. Gandhi, of course, never wanted the partition, but those of us who remained in India and learned Gujarati could easily have had good conversations with Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

When I meet members of the Pakistani migrant community, I find an utter love for Hindi movies and the Hindi language. They are able to mention the names of Indian actors and films with far more accuracy than I can. If you consider the linguistic capacity of humorous shows produced in Karachi, then you feel ashamed as an Indian at the lack of proficiency in Hindi/Urdu of the modern Indian actors, who get roles for their looks and less for their mastery of language.

Why can´t we bring a few actors and actresses from Pakistan and let them bring some linguistic proficiency to our Indian films? After all, they are equally big consumers of the films as we are. After 70 years of partition, Pakistanis on an average are better at Hindi/Urdu than we could ever imagine. No they are not speaking Arabic despite the flow of billions of petrodollars from the Gulf. They remained loyal to their cultural heritage. This is what love is about. The cultural bonding between India and Pakistan is so strong that I laugh more at Pakistani prank shows and enjoy with equal pleasure when I hear Urdu poems and talk shows from Pakistan with impeccable mastery of Hindi and Urdu. Hindi and Urdu connect our hearts and English has become the de facto official language in both our countries. We mix English with Hindi and speak Hinglish the same way the Pakistanis speak their Urglish.

Tomorrow as millions will watch the quarterfinals of a girls´ football match, a girl from Afghanistan, Nadia Nadim, will represent Denmark against Austria. She is not only a football player in Denmark. She is a medical student, too, and speaks 7 languages fluently, including Hindi and Urdu. A girl who probably has never lived in Pakistan and India speaks Hindi and Urdu. Isn´t this a fantastic example of cultural commonality?

I hope that history begins from here for India and Pakistan. For the people of Indus the number 7 has tremendous significance. After 70 years, those of us who have an open heart have realized that what we have in common has far more significance than our differences. How can we enjoy it when an ordinary Pakistani who speaks, walks, talks and dances like us lives a painful life?

Can we really rejoice when their democracy is in the doldrums? We have the social media, a huge Indian and Pakistani diaspora have settled abroad and they are able to see the striking similarity that is in our humor and our cultural habits.

In the next 70 years, I think India and Pakistan will not only become friends but maybe close partners. In the coming 70 years, we should be more rigorous in demanding that religious mullahs, priests, pundits and instigators who cause communal riots should be asked to show restraint.

We should start by building one large university where both Hindi and Urdu could be the subject of scholarship, and students from both countries should be encouraged to study there. Let us build institutions of peace, let poetry and shayari be the foundation of our new friendship. The international community can help by insisting that the army stay in the barracks and stop hiding terrorists in their backyards. No prime minister, including Nawaz Sharif, has been allowed to finish their term in the entire history of Pakistan. This is a shame. They are toppled when they want to stretch out the hand of friendship.

It is time for the peoples of both countries to realize that the enmity between them is causing pain and poverty in both countries and the beneficiaries are the arms dealers and the Chinese. China has succeeded in keeping people divided in order to maximize their influence. It has succeeded in keeping India and Pakistan from being friends and North and South Korea, which are also the same people and have the same language, from becoming one.

India and Pakistan could become the true champions of peace in the coming years."
