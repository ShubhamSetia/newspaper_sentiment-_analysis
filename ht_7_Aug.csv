Kusal Mendis earns Aravinda de Silva’s praise after ton vs India,"During Sri Lanka batting stalwart Aravinda de Silva’s career, opposition bowlers dreaded bowling to him at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground track. A batsman who always looked to dominate despite his average build, Aravinda de Silva had an intimidating presence at the ground thanks to his powerful cut and pull shots.

This season has been a bit hard to take for Sri Lanka stalwarts like him with their team being pushed hard by all opposition. For the first time in the series against India, the master blaster made his presence felt at the ground. It seemed to fire up the home team batsmen and that reflected in their improved performance in the second half of the day as for the first time in the series, Sri Lanka batsmen dominated the Indian attack.

Kusal’s counter

Leading the counter-attack was the 22-year-old rising star Kusal Mendis, who struck a blazing 110 off 135 balls on Saturday, the sort of dominating effort Aravinda de Silva was known for in his prime.

“Kusal is the best among the current lot. He has a great future in Sri Lankan cricket, but I feel he should not take unnecessary pressure, and continue to play freely,” Aravinda told the Hindustan Times as he was leaving the SSC after the third day’s play.

Marked out as the next big thing in Sri Lankan cricket, it was Mendis’ third century, the feature of it being the way he tamed R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja on a dry, turning surface.

Ashwin, who earlier in the day picked up his 26th five-wicket haul, was all praise for the youngster. “I thought Mendis batted beautifully. He put Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) off his length very quickly, kept on sweeping him, and he was lucky, he got away with it. But credit to him, he batted beautifully,” said Ashwin.

Different tactics

In contrast to the Indian batsmen who used their feet to dominate the spinners, Mendis played the cross-batted shots with good effect. Ashwin admitted the tactics forced the bowlers to change their length on occasion.

“It can be a bit challenging (to play cross-batted strokes). He (Mendis) did hit some good shots off some very, very good balls from the middle of the stumps. He could have put some good balls away for fours and hence the bowlers over-compensated and bowled a few short balls.”

Excited at the prospect of testing himself against a good opponent, Ashwin said he was looking forward to have a different tactics the next time they face off.

“As a batsman who’s sweeping against me, I don’t really mind it, it gives me a good chance. But having seen him for the first time, probably the next time I will try and come in with a different plan.”"

"Chipmaker Nvidia, Volvo, AutoLiv team up to develop self-driving vehicles by 2021","Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Monday announced it was partnering with Volvo Cars and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv to develop self-driving car technology for vehicles due to hit the market by 2021.

Volvo is owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd .

The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving.

Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain” of the autonomous vehicle.

The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG’s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.

In a call with reporters, Nvidia’s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.

The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia’s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called “Level 3” driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.

Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its “Drive Me” autonomous pilot program.

Volvo’s production vehicles built on Nvidia’s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021."
Can Barmer become ODF by end of 2017 with 70% work remaining?,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set October 2, 2019, as the deadline for the country to become open defecation free but Rajasthan’s cabinet minister Surendra Goyal, who’s in charge of Barmer, set a different deadline for the border district for the ODF tag. When he was in Barmer earlier last week, he said the district should become ODF by December 2017.

However, considering the progress of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBM), the national sanitation programme for construction of household latrines, in Barmer, the new deadline looks unachievable.

SBM data shows that only 28% households in the districts have toilets now.

According to a 2012 survey, there are 4.5 lakh households in the district; 3.61 lakh of them didn’t have toilets in 2012. In four years, 108,848 household constructed toilets but this is just 28% of the household which were without latrines until 2012.

In terms of villages, out of 1,970 villages in Barmer, only 523 have become free of open defecation. This is just 27% of the total villages.

There are 489 gram panchayats in the district. Out of them, only 173 are ODF, which is again only 29%.

So, in all respects, around 70% of the target remains to be met for the district to become ODF.

Considering the situation and to fulfill the targets Barmer district collector Shivprasad Madan Nakate has taken an initiative and announced a ‘Cleanliness Award’. Under this collector will invite village Sarpanch on coffee whose panchayats will get ODF tag.

Nakate said that he is expecting that this initiative will motivate the village sarpanches to personally look after the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s’ progress in their area. “We are also expecting that this initiative will help us to achieve the ODF target at the earliest, says collector.”

On the other villagers have alleged official apathy for legging behind in the ‘Swatch Bharat Abhiyan’. They alleged that authorities are not serious towards the campaign. Hemraj Choudhary, a local resident said that people in this region are belongs to backward section and financially they are not able to ensure such facilities.

According to Hemraj when government announced to support them with motivational amount rupees 12 thousand on construction of toiled people come forward and constructed toilets. Hemraj claimed that thousands are there who have constructed the toilets but now they are waiting for the motivational amount.

“Sometimes in the name of physical verification or other times in the name of budget crunch they were avoided for the payment. It is limiting their participation, he added.”

Countering such allegation authorities claimed that earlier they have faced budget crunch but now they have sufficient budget for the campaign and soon who have constructed the toilets will paid.

M.L.Nehra, chief executive officer at Zila Parishad in Barmer said that minister in-charge of the district Surendra Goyal has directed them to achieve ODF tag by December 31, 2017. He said that considering the topographical situation of the area though it seems difficult but also maintained that as people are now aware about the program and are supporting them, they are hopeful that they will achieve the tag by the deadline."

SGPC to hold function to remember 1965 Indo-Pak war heroes at Asal Uttar,"The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) will hold a grand religious function as a tribute to the 1965 Indo-Pak war hero, late Lieutenant General Harbakhsh Singh on September 8.

“Lieutenant General Harbakhsh Singh, who was the then commandant of army unit, played a key role in defeating Pakistani troops. To create awareness among youth of his bravery and inspire them, the SGPC will hold a function at Asal Uttar, the battle field of the war along the border in Tarn Taran,” SGPC chief Kirpal Singh Badungar told media persons on the sidelines of a function at the Golden Temple Complex on Friday.

The SGPC launched a drive to preach Sikhism, ‘Dharam Parchar Lehar’ in Majha on Friday at the Diwan Hall Manji Sahib in the Golden Temple complex. “The family of Abdul Hamid, the martyr of the war, will also be invited to the function. His portrait will also be installed at the Central Sikh museum in the Golden Temple to pay tribute to him,” Badungar added.

On whether the anniversary of ‘Dharam Yudh Morcha’ had been forgotten, Badungar said, “Punjab is the sole state of the country deprived of its own capital, a high court, river waters and Punjabi-speaking areas. Punjabis have sacrificed countless lives for the country and eradicated shortage of foodgrain.”

Claiming that the Congress was responsible for the alleged discrimination with Punjab, he said,“Congress leaders have never delivered on their promise. Even the Rajiv-Longowal Accord that has not been implemented so far — was another betrayal with Sikhs.” SGPC general secretary Amarjit Singh Chawla and other executive members. including Bhai Ram Singh, were accompanying Badungar. Badungar was, however, evasive on Anandpur Sahib Resolution that the Akalis had drafted.

On serving of non-vegetarian food on the premises of Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, he said, “I am yet to find out that what is the exact situation in the matter.”

Earlier, Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh and Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh had felicitated and honoured Badungar for starting the drive to spread Sikhism."
Sri Lanka’s sweeping success keeps them afloat in Colombo Test vs India,"At the end of the third day’s play in the second Test, Sri Lankan batsmen were a confused lot over whether the sweep shot is a good option or not.

If you look at their first innings, the verdict is that it has effectively cost Sri Lanka the match and series after captain Dinesh Chandimal’s was caught attempting to sweep Ravindra Jadeja, triggering a procession which saw the hosts crash to 183 all out in 49.4 overs in the first innings.

In the second essay, the script changed dramatically with the same shot being their most productive which helped Kusal Mendis counter the threat of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

Wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella, the only batsman to get a half-century in the first innings, revealed that their captain’s downfall didn’t put them off the strategy to take on the Indian spinners with the sweep shot on a turning wicket.

“We have to back ourselves 100 %. We might get out playing positive shots. We are now in a good situation by playing sweep shots,” said Dickwella.

“We were training hard on sweeps and reverse sweeps. Batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne and other coaches specifically speak about the sweep shots and encourage us to do that. When it comes to a spinning wicket, we have to play the sweep and that’s an option,” added Dickwella.

Talking about the refreshing approach in the second innings after their poor performance in the morning, Dickwella revealed it was the result of a brain-storming session in the dressing room during the lunch break.

“Our approach wasn’t right in the first innings, but we had a chat before the second innings and it paid off. We had the sweep shot as one of our options. We didn’t want to sweep so early. After the first innings we had a different approach and that paid off.”

As for his first innings cameo, Dickwella said: “I backed my strength. I used to play the sweep and the reverse sweep a lot. It was the best option on a spinning wicket against Ashwin and Jadeja. I swept about 80 % of my shots.”

"India vs Sri Lanka: Kusal Mendis hits ton, hosts finally show resistance","Powered by Mendis’s 110 and an unbeaten 92 from opener Karunaratne, Sri Lanka were 209 for two after being asked to follow-on at stumps on Day 3 of the second Test. The home team still trails by 230 runs after conceding a massive 439-run lead following a woeful batting display in the morning. (Sri Lanka vs India Day 3 highlights)

Hardik Pandya provided India the breakthrough at the fag end of the day with wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha taking a brilliant diving catch off Mendis’s inside edge. The counter-attacking innings was studded with 17 fours and came off just 135 balls. (SL vs IND Day 3 scorecard)

LANKAN FIGHTBACK

Ever since India’s epic fightback in 2001, Eden Gardens, teams are reluctant to give follow-on. This Indian team management is also not keen on going for the option, and refused to take it in Galle, but with a lead of 439 runs after the first innings of the second Test, they had no choice.

The Sri Lanka batsmen provided another proof of how teams have become harder to crack when they follow-on. With the home team offering no resistance on the third morning, captain Virat Kohli’s target would been to get close to wrapping up the game by the close of play.

PLAN VS SPINNERS

Sri Lanka’s second innings too started on a poor note when Upul Tharanga was bowled by Umesh Yadav in the third over. On the dry surface, spinners R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were the main threat. But Mendis and Karunaratne had their plans in place for the two.

Mendis came in and straightaway went for his shots. He countered the threat from R Ashwin by targeting the midwicket region. He used the cross-batted shot to good effect whenever the spinner gave air. Though a risky option, the diminutive batsman executed it well by coming on top of the bounce. He raced away to the three-figure mark with his batting partner still in his 70s. Karunaratne looked to play straight, and worked the ball off the pads by relying on the safer flick shot.

The two added 191 for the second wicket, and more importantly, gave their team the self-belief.

HARA KIRI

Earlier, R Ashwin picked his 26th five-wicket haul to bundle out Sri Lanka for 183. He was well-supported by Ravindra Jadeja, who completed 150 Test wickets with his second scalp of the day.

Resuming the day on 50 for two, the Sri Lankan innings disintegrated quickly. Jadeja created doubts in batsmen’s minds in the first over itself when he let a few balls rip across the blade. The batsmen showed no confidence in their play on the second evening and they were tentative at the start of Saturday’s game.

There was no application and they paid a price for it. The home team’s hopes rested almost entirely on the overnight pair of Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis. However, both fell to poor shots.

The left-arm spinner didn’t have to wait long for his first wicket as captain Dinesh Chandimal failed to keep a sweep shot down at the total of 60, hitting it straight to the square leg fielder. Mendis followed soon after when he tried an extravagant shot against pacer Umesh Yadav and holed out to the mid-on fielder.

Mendis tried to make amends in the second innings, but the effort seems to have come a tad late to save the match and series."

AAP Government in Delhi completes two years: A report card,"For Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, change only on paper

East Azad Nagar was authorised four years but the area still has poor civic amenities.(Raj K Raj/HT Photo)

In street number 4 of East Azad Nagar, January was the month for hectic wedding preparations. The neighbourhood was transformed with festive music, lights and flavours. Nothing, however, could fix the perennial waterlogging in the lane.

“My daughter’s wedding was an occasion to celebrate but the water-logging caused us so much embarrassment. We stayed inside most of the time. It is what we do the rest of the year too as the lane is always water-logged,” said 65-year-old Asha (name changed), who lives here.

The 3-feet wide lane is home to a row of multiple-storey houses built on 25-yard plots. Four years back, East Azad Nagar earned the ‘legal’ tag as its layout plan was approved by the municipal corporation. However, that changed nothing on ground for the residents.

Regularisation of unauthorised colonies — one of the biggest political issues in the Capital — stems from the failure of successive governments to provide planned housing. Official estimates peg the number of unauthorised colonies in the city at 1,650, with about 50 lakh residents. East Azad Nagar was one of the 895 colonies which were regularised by then Sheila Dikshit government in 2012.

Ahead of the 2015 assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party also promised to provide registration rights with regard to property and sale deeds in resettlement colonies.

“We will provide water, sewer lines, electricity, schools and hospitals in a systematic and phased manner. Multi-pronged approach is the only way to empower unauthorised colonies, and has never been attempted by the BJP or the Congress. Within one year, these unauthorised colonies will be regularised and residents will be given ownership rights,” the AAP manifesto promised.

Soon after coming to power, the AAP government announced the decision to open registry of property in unauthorised colonies bypassing the process to be completed by the municipal corporations. The government said in 2015 that soon after it sends the boundary details to corporations, it will also allow registry of property.

However, the process is now stuck as the Union urban development ministry has asked the Delhi government to submit details of plot size and population in these colonies.

“We have received a letter from UD ministry with a list of queries. They want to know the population of every colony, size of plots, vacant plots, details of land owning agency and cost of regularisation,” said an official in the Delhi urban development department of Delhi government. Officials say it will take time to prepare the report even as lakhs of people continue to battle with the living conditions on a daily basis.

“Government should acknowledge that these colonies have come up because of the failure of those in power. The onus is on the government as they were supposed to build these houses. The government should simply try to make the living condition better in these colonies,” said Dunu Roy, director, Hazards Centre.

However, regularisation and approval of layout hasn’t meant better amenities for these colonies. East Azad Nagar, for example, has the tiniest of roads, no parking infrastructure, open overflowing drains and dangling power wires. Moreover, the structural safety of buildings in these colonies is a major cause of concern.

“Regularised or not, our problems are the same. The main road has been carpeted several times because of which the level of our lane has become lower, hence the water-logging,” said Rakesh, a resident of East Azad Nagar’s street number four.

Subhash Chandra Kohli, president of East Azad Nagar RWA, agrees that nothing has changed on ground. “Delhi government is still to include the colony in the official map of authorised Delhi colonies,” he says.

Senior officials who worked on approval of the layout plan of East Azad Nagar in 2013 say several rules, as per the Master Plan, were bypassed in the process. “The law mandates a clearly defined minimum width of streets and bylanes, space for public utilities and emergency measures. On paper, most of these were done with riders. For example, the width of the streets has been increased by marking them with dotted lines. A rider has been inserted in the statute that whenever the property owner applies for reconstruction of house, the building plan will be passed taking into account the marked line on the map,” an official said.

Officials admit that the only possible benefits of regularisation will be ownership of property and making the area eligible for basic government services. Vijay Kumar, a resident of street number 19, A-block, East Azad Nagar concurs, “The only way it helps us is that we can now sell and purchase property legally.”"
From collision to cover-up: the inside story of the Chennai oil spill,"“This is a massive screw up,” said Abhijit Singh, who heads the Observer Research Foundation’s (ORF) Maritime Policy Initiative . “Something isn’t adding up. The initial reaction was very tardy and there was an attempt to hush up.”

What follows is the first detailed account of the collision and its aftermath, revealing a series of oversights and operational missteps that put India’s eastern coast at peril .

Port officials have prevaricated on everything from the quantity of oil spilt and the time needed for cleanup, to the long-term effects on the region’s fragile and besieged marine ecology.

A fortnight after the Dawn Kanchipuram spilt an estimated 75 tonnes of bunker oil — a heavy petroleum residue used to start ship engines — port authorities are yet to explain how two enormous tankers, each freighted with inflammable hydrocarbons, could collide three kilometres off the Chennai coastline.

The errors began as soon as the Maple left its berth. At Kamarajar Port, like elsewhere in the world, specialist navigators, called pilots, accompany large ships out to sea.

But according to a police report filed by A.K. Gupta, the port’s Director for Marine Services, the Maple let go of her pilot, V. Karunanidhi, well before his designated disembarkation point as Capt. Sahadevan was confident of navigating the ship by himself.

M.A. Bhaskarachar, Chairman and Managing Director of Kamarajar Port, said Karunanidhi continued to monitor the Maple’s progress and even messaged the Maple at 3:24 am to say: you are going to collide, be careful.

It is unclear if the Maple acknowledged this message. The ship stayed its course and continued to pick up speed until it collided, 20 minutes later, with the Kanchipuram at 3:45 am.

“Every harbour has its own idiosyncrasies. Captains, irrespective of experience, must rely on a pilot – those are the rules.” - Former harbour pilot

Once the collision occurred, the port’s pollution response fell apart.

The authorities claimed only one tonne oil had spilt, and then said 20 tonnes after the Coast Guard issued a separate statement. The final quantity of spilt oil, officials privately admit, could rise to 100 tonnes.

“The port should handle a spill of this size, but couldn’t. We came in because they asked us for help,” said a senior officer in the Coast Guard. “By then much of the damage was done.”

One plausible scenario is that the port panicked, sought to suppress news of the incident, and called the Coast Guard only once they realised the scale of the spill.

So when did port authorities learn of the accident?

“We cannot say anything, investigation is underway,” said A.K. Gupta, Kamarajar’s Director for Marine services. But a press release states the Coast Guard was informed at 6:15 am and spill containment measures began at 7 am, three hours after the incident.

This may seem like a short time, but experts disagree.

“If a tanker is involved, you need to send a team in half an hour,” said Singh, from the ORF, “These are standing operating procedures, it is not a discretionary decision.”

In 2012, the Indian government hired Saab, a Swedish military supplier, to set up a network of radars, radio receivers and cameras — called the National Automatic Identification System (NAIS) — to improve coastal surveillance in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attack.

“The system can track anomalies and send alerts if a ship suddenly veers off course, or if a ship suddenly stops or collides,"" said an expert who has worked with the system, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive technology.

“The coastguard has a guy tracking the NAIS at all times,” said a retired Coast Guard official, noting that the NAIS has a centre in Chennai. “In this day and age, no one needs to inform anyone about anything, just look at your damn screen.”"
A decade of soaring Delhi University cutoffs,"If you scored less than 70% in Class 12, this year you have close to 26 options across Delhi University colleges. Only subjects offered — Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu.

A decade ago, you had at least 120 — the options, slight more diverse, with subject choices such as History and Political Science as well.

As senior secondary board examinations across the country keep seeing rising scores due to moderation, Delhi University cutoffs keep increasing to accommodate only a limited number of students on the top.

While the Commerce courses have historically been in the 85+ bracket, the rise of Humanities has emerged only in the recent years. Today, courses like History and Political Science require as many marks as one would need for popular courses like Economics.

This year, over 60% of Delhi University cutoffs for the general category have crossed the 90% mark. In 2008, this figure was merely at 8%.

All cutoffs are from the first list and indicate the minimum score required in the general category. There is no data for several courses such as B.A. (P) in 2013 due to the introduction of FYUP.

Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

Makeshift the ground on which we stand: Eunice de Souza (1940-2017),"Even before I met Eunice de Souza, she had me overawed, and more than slightly terrified of her. I later found out this was the natural state of being for generations of her students, who encountered the stylish, unconventional, constantly challenging professor of English in her classrooms throughout an influential 30-year career at St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai. But I studied abroad and was never her student. Instead, de Souza first confronted me in books, most memorably her debut volume of poetry, the mesmerizing ‘Fix’ (Newground, 1979).

That slender collection of just 24, mostly short, poems accosted my consciousness like an ear-splitting thunderclap. It was at once confounding and irresistible, utterly beguiling but also deeply unsettling. For starters, I couldn’t get over the Arun Kolatkar-designed cover, with its silver monochrome portrait of unblinking Eunice close up, with an X etched on her forehead, the instantly obvious reference being to Charles Manson, who had carved up his own face to “secede from the human race.” And then, as I turned the pages gasping at poem after razor-sharp poem, de Souza radically and permanently disturbed my sense of self, cutting mercilessly to the bone to upend any number of cosy certainties.

The cover of Fix (1979) (www.Amazon.in)

In just a couple days after her death, a host of moving tributes have illuminated what it was like to have Eunice as a colleague, as an inspirational (and irascible) teacher, as mentor and friend and ally. Almost every one of these testimonials has been written by a woman. But what was it like to have to deal with Eunice de Souza as an unconsciously (innocently?) privileged Goan Catholic male, thus the prime target of her most acid verse? Let me tell you, it never stops being highly uncomfortable. For me, reading Eunice de Souza has always felt uncannily like having my pants pulled off in public, and then receiving an unending succession of stinging kicks to the rear. At first you gasp and squirm, but then eventually become resigned to the inevitable. Finally, as I once confided to Eunice at the end of a long evening, I’ve come to expect and rather enjoy the unmanning and pasting. That quasi-masochistic confidence delighted her no end.

Forgive Me, Mother(Fix, 1979)

Forgive me, mother,

That I left you

a life-long widow

old, alone

It was kill or die

and you got me anyway:

The blood congeals at lover’s touch

The guts dissolve in shit.

I was never young.

Now I’m old, alone

In dreams

I hack you.

If there is a unifying theme to Eunice de Souza’s life and lengthy intellectual progression, it is liberation, rigorously essayed at almost any cost. Her emancipatory journey began immediately after school, when she decamped from Poona’s increasingly stifling Goan Catholic community to study at the University of Bombay (she earned a BA (Hons) in English Literature in 1960). Having lost her father at the age of three, the future poet hated growing up in a small-minded, gossipy and judgemental small town universe, where she stood out for being raised by a widowed, embittered mother under somewhat straitened circumstances. That alienating experience never left her, and underlies a considerable portion of her oeuvre.

Unerringly independent of mind, and already possessed of blood-curdling sardonicism, de Souza rapidly achieved notoriety amongst the parochial Aunties and Uncles of Goan Catholic Poona. My mother and uncles grew up with her, and can easily recall the stirs she generated by speaking out in school, and for cultivating adult relationships with proto-bohemians like the Shantiniketan-trained artist, Angelo da Fonseca. Not much later, she wrote a poem that stayed unpublished for decades, “I want a father/always have./God won’t do/He’s too judgemental./And so I found you/ Like my father, absent.”

This, in her own words, is another major theme of de Souza’s life. That is, her ambivalent passion for male company, complete with vulnerability to every kind of disappointment, and a correspondingly deadly eye for weakness, hypocrisy and cant. She truly loved men, that much is more than clear from her writings. But that sentiment was balanced with brutal honesty about their fumbling and foibles, as well as an incandescent ire about the injustice of the way the world works to undermine and sideline her own sex. In important early poems from ‘Fix’ like ‘Bandra Christian Party’, ‘Marriages are Made’ and, most vividly, ‘Catholic Wife’, one or another pompous Goan Catholic “pillar of the church” stands in for all patriarchal hypocrites, while “the pillar’s wife says nothing.”

In 2012, speaking to a rapt and adoring audience in Panjim, the pocket-sized Latinate capital of Goa, de Souza explained, “When I wrote a number of poems, critical in some ways of Goans, I had Poona Goans in mind because those were the ones I knew. Rather like Irish Catholic families, they encouraged parents to have large families, they were concerned with the colour of one’s skin, the wickedness of even knowing about sex. To know about sex was to be ‘sophisticated,’ and that was the most damning word one could apply to a girl. It was some time before I recognized that these were shortcomings we shared with every other community. Nevertheless, I was told by a student that a priest has denounced them from a pulpit at St Peter’s in Bandra. When I told the poet Adil Jussawalla this he said if I continued in the way I was going, I would soon be denounced from St Peter’s in Rome!”

By that point, the feared dragon lady of St Xavier’s was several years into retirement, and allegedly mellowed beyond the recognition of her former pupils. If that is indeed true, I am extremely fortunate it is when our own connection took place. With some trepidation about what might ensue, I was responsible for inviting Eunice for her first-ever reading of her poems in her ancestral homeland on the sidelines of a path-breaking, monumental art exhibition, ‘Aparanta: The Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa’ curated by Ranjit Hoskote in 2007. In the event, she was disarmingly charming in person, and altogether radiant on stage. None of us could get enough, and she knew it.

Very late one evening on that trip, on a candle lit terrace overlooking the Arabian Sea, de Souza spoke with great feeling about ‘ways of belonging’ that characterized the many-layered relationship she had with her roots, with complicated implications for how Goa finds meaning within modern India. That conversation led to a new, unique Goa Art + Literature Festival focused on what is usually called “the margins” - Goa, Kashmir, the North East states, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as genres like poetry, translations and graphic novels. Eunice repeatedly presided at the annual event with notable pleasure, earning herself a legion of new fans including Khasi rock legend, Lou Majaw (who followed her around like a hefty puppy for days), and then-Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (who was photographed looking like a mouse transfixed next to Eunice, rendered helpless by her feline, feminine wiles).

India has been scandalously cavalier to the pioneering Indo-Anglian poets, for outdated and hopelessly misguided nationalistic reasons. It was several years after Arun Kolatkar’s death that his genius was adequately recognized, typically disgracefully only after his work was published to great acclaim in the USA. There is no doubt in my mind the same will happen to Eunice de Souza’s poems, which have a rare universal quality that seem to me inherently resistant to becoming dated. They will last, with impact undimmed, as one of the vital modernist artistic achievements of independent India.

However, it is as anthologist that Eunice truly stands alone. Over decades of spirited labour, she unearthed and revived the work of a prodigious number of overlooked and forgotten writers. Our understanding of the breadth of Indian literature is incalculably enriched by books like ‘Purdah: An Anthology’ (OUP, 2004), ‘Women’s Voices: Selections from Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Indian Writing in English’ (OUP, 2004), and ‘Early Indian Poetry in English: An Anthology 1829-1947’ (OUP, 2005). As she explained in the introduction to the latter volume, she was motivated to “re-map” comprehensively. “Literary battles take place in every culture, colonized and colonizing, and class, region, gender and religion all come into play when deciding who or what creates a nation’s identity, who speaks for it. It is my impression that, in India at least, the battle too often takes precedence over the actual reading of texts. In fact, come of it takes place without texts being read at all.”

Eunice de Souza’s last collection of poems (www.Amazon.in)

It is both typical and maddening of Eunice to have departed a lifetime of burrowing through mountains of archives, while leaving behind just a few slim books of poetry for us who remain. I remember her laughing inscrutably at my suggestion that she was the only writer in the world whose collected works actually dwindled quite appreciably over the years, as lines were re-assessed then deleted, and some poems discreetly abandoned in toto. She was the knife whittling to the irreducible, always trying to distill an encompassing world view to a few spare lines. That microcosmic impulse is particularly evident in her last book of poems, the wry, luminous ‘Learn from the Almond Leaf’ where a poet at the height of her powers returns often to the prospect of the end. All those who knew Eunice de Souza realize this wasn’t an accident. It’s just that she couldn’t trust anyone else to do clear-eyed justice to her epitaph.

Another Poem About Death (Learn from the Almond Leaf, Poetrywala 2016)

I keep hearing sounds

Of wind and water.

There is no wind.

There is no water.

There is no air.

I see the pallor on her face

The hardening hand

I know

There is no one there.

MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

New 2017 Honda Civic spotted at Tapukara factory: When is it coming to India?,"Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) offers a mid-size sedan City and also a high-end luxury sedan Accord Hybrid, but the love and eagerness for the new Civic in India has been surprising.

And after spotting this 2017 avatar of the Civic at Honda’s Tapukara factory in Rajasthan, we are convinced: The Civic will make a comeback.

The 2017 Civic is launched in various global markets, and it is expected to come to India soon. (Gulshankumar Wankar / HT Photo)

“So far we have not heard any negative feedback about the Civic,” Yoichiro Ueno, president and CEO of HCIL, told HT during our visit to the factory on Wednesday.

“I see a lot of people in my neighbourhood still driving the old Civic with lots of care and love. May be the cars are getting older. So if a replacement car is launched, those customers will also love it,” he added.

The Honda Civic was first launched in 2006 in the lower D segment. The Civic was available in the 1.8-litre i-VTEC petrol engine, in both manual as well as automatic transmissions.

It won several industry awards including the Indian Car of the Year (ICOTY) 2007 and topped the JD Power Initial Quality Study in 2010.

But sales in the lower D segment, of Toyota Corolla and Hyundai Elantra, fell by 29% in 2012-13 over the previous year; Honda itself managed to sell only 685 Civics -- almost 70% fewer -- during the same period. So Honda pulled the Civic out of the market in 2013.

Globally, the 2017 edition launched in various avatars has garnered great feedback -- Civic Coupe, Civic 4-door sedan, Civic 4-door hatchback and a sports version Civic Type R.

So when is the new Civic coming to India?

The most convincing answer Honda could give us was: “Soon may be. We are getting a lot of enquiries. We are finishing our assessment. It takes time.”

Market speculations say the new version would come around the festive season later this year or during the Delhi Auto Expo in February 2018.

Multiple HCIL personnel told HT the model spotted at the Honda factory was imported from Japan for “research purposes only”, “to evaluate the parts” and “testing”.

It could be this specimen that would be replicated to make the future Civics for India. HT also learnt that the new Civic would be made at Honda’s Greater Noida factory, where the carmaker produces the premium sports utility vehicle CR-V, the compact urban hatchback Brio, the compact sedan Amaze and the new Honda City."
1971 Indo-Pak war prisoner’s daughter to protest in Delhi,"1971 Indo-Pak war prisoner Balwinder Singh’s daughter was in tarn Taran at an event on Saturday. Baljinder Kaur, 45, whose father is lodged in Pakistan’s Kot Lakhpat Jail, said she will protest, for her father’s release, in New Delhi at Janatar Mantar on August 10.

Baljinder has been campaigning for her father’s release from past two years.Baljinder had also raised the issue with external affairs minister, Sushma Sawraj, demanding the release of all 74 prisoners from Pakistan’s jail. “I met Sawraj at New Delhi but instead of assuring me to take action, she asked me to wait for improvement in India-Pakistan’s bilateral relations,” she said.

She said, “My father and other prisoners have been famishing there sice a long time now but the central government is turning a blind eye towards the matter.” She claimed that the 74 Indian soldiers were made captive by the Pakistan Army during the 1971 war.

She said, “The government will celebrate 70th Independence Day. But soldiers who served the country have been living in a terrible condition. The country should first come out to help in the release of the Indian soldiers.”

“By neglecting them, the government is playing with the sentiments of the soldier families’,” she said.

She said, “I will protest at Jantar Mantar till the government does not put efforts in releasing the prisoners of war.”

Balwinder Singh was a Sepoy in the Sikh Regiment and posted at Barmer district of Rajasthan during 1971 Indo-Pak war.

‘Never saw my father’

According to Balwinder Singh’s daughter, she has not seen her father since her birth . She said, “My father came home for his marriage in 1971. He received a call about the initiation of Indo-Pak war and reported back. He was not there when I was born.”

A ray of hope emerged in 2015, when we received a message from an Indian prisoner, released by Pakistan goverment, that my father is lodged at Kot Lakhpat Jail, she said."
Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

UK to ban sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040,"Britain on Wednesday it will outlaw the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040 in a bid to cut air pollution but environmental groups said the proposals did not go far enough.

Environment minister Michael Gove announced the move as part of the government’s keenly-awaited 3 billion pounds (USD 3.9 billion, 3.4 billion euro) air pollution plan, which will demand that councils propose measures by March next year to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.

The ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as vans follows a similar proposal by the French government, and will also include hybrid vehicles that have an electric motor and a petrol or diesel engine.

“The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to ensure that by 2050 there would be no diesel or petrol vehicles on the road and today we’re confirming that should mean no new diesel or petrol vehicles by 2040,” Gove told BBC Radio 4.

Britain’s High Court demanded that the government produce plans to tackle illegal NO2 pollution, largely caused by diesel emissions, and a draft report was published in May, but the full report was delayed by last month’s snap general election.

The government will provide local councils with 255 million pounds to bring NO2 levels to legal levels, with possible solutions including the removal of speed humps, reprogramming traffic lights and changing road layouts.

Campaigners want cities to impose entry fees on diesel drivers, but councils will only be allowed to do so if no other measures are available, with ministers wary of “punishing” drivers of cars who bought their vehicles in good faith, according to media reports.

“Diesel drivers are not to blame and, to help them switch to cleaner vehicles, the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme, one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans,” a government spokesman said.

Gove added that he did not believe “that it is necessary to bring in charging.”

Campaign group ClientEarth warned that health issues “caused by exposure to illegal air pollution are happening now, so we need urgent action.”

Fellow campaigners Greenpeace also warned that the plans did not do enough to combat the immediate issue of NO2 pollution in cities

“While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” said Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK.

“Providing a long term vision is not enough, (Michael) Gove still needs protect our health right now from toxic fumes polluting our streets.”

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that the move could cost jobs.

“Currently demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles is growing but still at a very low level as consumer have concern over affordability, range and charging points,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

“Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, we could undermine the UK’s successful automotive sector if we don’t allow enough time for the industry to adjust.”

Air pollution contributes to the death of more than 40,000 people per year in Britain, according to official figures, with nitrogen dioxide a particular problem.

Norway, which is aiming to end the use of all cars running on fossil fuels by 2025, offers generous tax breaks for electric vehicles as well as free parking and the use of bus lanes."
India aim to wrap up Test series vs Sri Lanka in Colombo,"about the video

Lokesh Rahul’s imminent return leaves skipper Virat Kohli with an unenviable task of dropping opener Abhinav Mukund as India aim to clinch the three-match series against Sri Lanka with another resounding victory in the second Test starting in Colombo tomorrow. The selection conundrum is a testimony to the superb bench strength of the team. Lokesh Rahul’s absence hardly affected the performance with India thrashing the hosts by 304 runs, starting the series with a bang. Meanwhile, back in the side, fit-again Sri Lank captain Dinesh Chandimal hopes to revive his team’s fledgling fortunes in the second Test with a match-winning effort, similar to the one he produced against India two years ago.

A week of upsets at Wimbledon may signal the end of an era,"Rafael Nadal’s dreams of a third Wimbledon title were shattered on Monday when he lost in the fourth round to 26th-ranked Gilles Muller. Then, on Wednesday, two more former champions and tournament favourites – Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – went down to lower ranked players (Sam Querrey and Thomas Berdych, respectively). Murray and Djokovic were both thwarted by injuries, and Nadal, famous for his seemingly endless reserve of stamina, succumbed in the 28th game of the fifth set. Taken together, the three upsets – each one against a former champion now in his 30’s – may signal the coming of an end of an era in men’s tennis. To be sure, three upsets do not make a trend. And Roger Federer, the oldest of the Big 4, may yet manage to win his record eighth Wimbledon on Sunday. But a trove of data, compiled by sports statistician Jeff Sackman, also suggests that the previous decade of men’s tennis – characterized by a handful of top players’ domination of the field – may be very different from the years to come.

Upsets in Grand Slams In 2003, a 21-year-old Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title. The intervening years have been marked by near total dominance in the men’s field, with four players – Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray – winning 48 of the 56 Grand Slam tournaments. If it has been one of the greatest eras of men’s tennis, it has also been one of its most predictable. Since Federer first became Wimbledon champion, upsets have become increasingly rare in the men’s field. If we define an upset as a match in which the winner’s rank was at least 10 lower than the loser’s, we find that the frequency of Grand Slam upsets dropped from about 26% in 2003 to about 21% in 2016. Every year since 1991, upsets on the men’s side were more common on the women’s side. But in 2008, men’s upsets finally became less common than women’s, and have remained so ever since.

While it is possible that the trend will continue into the future, it is at least as likely that the coming years will see a regression to the mean. That is particularly true because the men who have dominated tennis for the last several years are getting too old to keep winning all the time.

Tennis is old The Big 4 have been dominating men's tennis for more than 10 years now. The youngest of the four is Novak Djokovic, who turned 30 in May. The oldest, Roger Federer, will be 36 in August. They are not only the best players on the tour right now, but also among the oldest. And it’s not just the Big 4 – the top 50 players are on an average older than they've been in the past 30 years. Women, too, are getting older. And as the top players have aged, younger players have had to wait longer to make it into the top ranks.

Virat Kohli meets WWE star The Great Khali on ‘Friendship Day’,"After wrapping up a comprehensive victory in the second Test against Sri Lanka at Colombo, Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli caught up with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestler The Great Khali.

India thrashed the struggling Sri Lankan team once again in the ongoing three-Test series, winning the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) by an innings and 53 runs, thus taking an unassailable 2-0 lead.

This is for the second time in a row that India have accomplished a Test series win in Sri Lanka — a tricky as well as challenging Test venue for many great sides.

Post India’s win, on ‘Friendship Day’, the Indian captain caught up with the WWE wrestler who can be described as the first Indian to have made it big in one of the biggest sports entertainment events.

Kohli looked rather teensy standing beside the giant frame of Khali, in the two pictures he posted on his Twitter page.

India made to work hard

India were made to work hard for their victory in the second Test. After being bundled out cheaply in the first innings, Sri Lanka found their batsmen rising up to the occasion with Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis smacking impressive centuries.

India entered the fourth day of the Test requiring another 8 wickets and they had to put in some hard work to achieve their goal.

READ | VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS: India inflict innings defeat on Sri Lanka in Colombo Test

“We said this morning that even if we don’t get wickets early on, we are going to enjoy the tough times because they really improve you as a side and you need those tough times to improve as cricketers,” Kohli said after India’s victory.

“We were very happy that we went through that difficult phase as well, for you never want to get complacent as a side.”"
Virat Kohli believes India’s close catching still work in progress,"Abhinav Mukund set the benchmark in the first Test with two spectacular dismissals at short-leg and then declared he was keen to be known as a specialist close-in fielder. It’s a position which demands, apart from skills a lot of daring. The fielder needs to have the guts to watch the ball for two extra seconds and not turn away when the batsman shapes to hit towards him.

In the second Test, KL Rahul and Cheteshwar Pujara pulled off one good catch each at close-in in the first innings but overall the standard of catching was not up to the mark. Otherwise, Sri Lanka’s resistance in the second innings would have ended much earlier.

Rahul floored a straightforward catch off Dimuth Karunaratne on the fourth morning, and the opener, who was on 95, thwarted India till after lunch.

READ | Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja spell double trouble for Sri Lanka

Similarly, before Pujara pulled off a spectacular one-handed catch at slips to dismiss Karunaratne in the first innings, he was guilty of not even reacting to a chance that went through the slip cordon.

Among the close-in catchers, only Ajinkya Rahane and keeper Wriddhiman Saha came out with flying colours in this game.

India captain Virat Kohli admitted his team’s close-in catching is a work in progress.

READ | India put away the sweep shot, Sri Lanka swear by it in Colombo Test

“That is certainly an area that we want to keep improving in. On a pitch like that where it is getting slower, sometimes you end up standing ahead because you want to pick catches from the front. And then when one big shot is played and the ball is bowled quick, you suddenly look like you are not in position.

“It is a very tricky thing. Maybe, we will have to figure out a certain distance we just stay in, no matter whether the ball falls in front of us (or not). Specialists are always nice. KL and Pujara are our close-in specialists. Pujara does gully for spinners as well but then he takes on short-leg and KL hasn’t done as much of that practice as Pujara does. So it becomes tricky,” said Kohli.

Virat Kohli’s close catching too is not top notch. Experts were analysing how he instinctively commits to one side and is late when the ball goes the other way.

“I try to chip in, but when I drop catches it looks bad. We will have to figure out who stands in those positions consistently and keep those guys there for longer periods. That is the solution going forward.”"
"Usain Bolt’s record will not be matched any time soon, says Virat Kohli","Despite a lot happening in the world of sport, everything took a backseat on Saturday night as the world was gripped by the Usain Bolt fever.

India captain Virat Kohli too paid tribute to the king of athletics, saying the world was unlikely to see someone shine so bright as Bolt. “He (Bolt) deserves it because there is no one greater than him and it was his last race. I also wished him because we both are Puma athletes. We have not seen a career like that in athletics and I don’t think that, going forward, these records will be broken in a hurry,” said Kohli.

While Justin Gatlin has played second fiddle to Bolt all through his career, in the legend’s last race, the American finally breasted the tape ahead of the Jamaican.

But, after the race, Gatlin bowed to the ultimate champion in respect. Something that Kohli himself was seen doing during the second Test when he applauded the Sri Lankan centurions, Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne.

“On the field, I always try to create as difficult a situation as possible so that he (the opponent) gets out. But at the same time, if he achieves something, then you must also appreciate it. The opposition will always test you, either with their plans or with their talk. But when people do well…you understand how much strength and hard work has gone into it. So you must appreciate that, it is very necessary.”"

How Hardik Pandya survived on Maggi before becoming Indian cricket team star,"Hardik Pandya, Indian cricket team star who has taken giant strides from being an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricketer to making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Galle, has really come a long way. Battling several financial difficulties at home, he and his brother Krunal established themselves as talent to watch out for.

Hardik Pandya revealed his struggles and journey through the ranks to the national side on a talk show. The 23-year-old informed how he would eat two-minute noodle snack Maggi for morning and evening meals and borrow cricket kit to play.

“During U-19 days, my diet would be Maggi, both in the morning and evening. I was a big fan of Maggi and the situation was also like that. It was difficult to maintain a diet, financially it was a problem. Now I can eat whatever I want, but that time there were many problems in the family, especially financial issues,” Hardik Pandya said on ‘What the Duck’ show.

READ | Hardik Pandya can be to India what Ben Stokes is to England: Virat Kohli

“During U-16 days, the taste buds were pretty active, it was tough to control, but now I have to. It has been a beautiful journey.

Borrowing cricket kit

“A lot of people are not aware of this. We had bought a car but there were no savings. Wherever Krunal and I would go to play matches, we would go in the car. We had to take cricket kit from Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) for one year. I was 17 and Krunal was, I guess, around 19. A lot of people questioned, ‘they are coming in a car but cannot afford a cricket kit?’,” he said.

Hardik clarified that many people were not aware of their situation. “We were pretty much sure we will never accept sympathy from anyone, no matter what.

“My father was the only earning person at home. He suffered a heart attack — not one but two and that too within one night. He almost got another attack six months later, but we were glad we reached the hospital in time. The financial problems started at that time ... we had no savings and perhaps we spent more than what we earned,” revealed Hardik.

READ | IPL 2017: Krunal and Hardik Pandya living their dream with Mumbai Indians

“We used to get Rs 40,000 per year (read month) but they would cut Rs 4,000 TDS. Whatever we would earn would go in EMIs. We had a monthly EMI of Rs 10,000 for the car alone.

“We used to go to different villages to play. Krunal used to get more money — he would get Rs 500 for a match and I made Rs 400. But we would always travel in the car… nothing is bigger in life than self-respect (laughs). We would go to a petrol pump and buy two litres of petrol in bottles. We would stop a little ahead of the petrol pump. The second bottle would serve as back-up, so that we can at least get back home. We cannot empty both the bottles in one go, as we would never know how long it would last. This is my story till six months before I played IPL,” he shared.

What better to live moments which i often fantasized as a growing kid!

Hardik and Krunal both play for Mumbai Indians, but it is the younger brother who broke into the national side first.

Tendulkar’s advice

It is well-known that Sachin Tendulkar had told Hardik Pandya during an IPL season that he would play for India soon, but the former did not expect it would be within six months.

“I still remember the first time I met Sachin Tendulkar. It was a surprising encounter. It was the first match for Mumbai Indians (MI), I was already star-struck and we were leaving for Kolkata. I was having my food and someone tapped my shoulder from behind and said ‘hi’. I turned around and literally dropped my plate. I kept it aside; I was astounded. We were not expecting; no one had informed us that he would be coming over. It took about 20-25 minutes for me to gather myself,” he recalled.

READ | How Sachin Tendulkar foresaw Hardik Pandya’s meteoric rise as a cricketer

“Not many people would know this. When I had not even played for India, before that we had a do-or-die game in Hyderabad. He (Tendulkar) told me ‘I want to speak to you, meet me some time later’. I went to him after the match but he was busy with the team and he told me, ‘let us speak in Mumbai’.

“In Mumbai, after a warm-up session, I went to him. I was very curious what he would say. Tendulkar took me aside and told me ‘you are doing really well. I should not be telling you but the way you have been playing, the talent and potential you have, you will play for India in the next one or one-and-a-half years’. I called up Krunal and told him Sir has said so and so. For my family it did not matter whether I played for India or not, since it was Sachin Sir who had said this, it gave an assurance that I could do something good for myself,” Hardik shared.

Expressive Pandya

Hardik Pandya also recalled his innings against Royal Challengers Bangalore, batting alongside Harbhajan Singh. “I still remember it was my first innings against RCB. I had walked out to bat in a funny situation of sorts. Two overs were left and we were only two wickets down. I was not padded up. They had a bowler named David Wiese and he claimed three wickets in one over. I went in in a hurry and went to Bhajji pa, he said just one thing ‘jee le zindagi’ (live your life). I went on to hit two sixes,” he said.

“People think that I am a drama king. It is my personality, I cannot hide my expressions. Whatever I do, I do it openly, even when I am alone. It comes naturally to me,” Hardik added."
‘End of combustion engine-powered car’: Volvo to go all electric from 2019,"Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo’s plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

“This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” Volvo Cars chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully or partially electric.

“These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,” Volvo said.

“This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.”

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division.

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made."
Rakhi 2017: Are you looking for gifts? Here are 4 ways you can be a smart shopper,"Raksha Bandhan, the festival to celebrate the love and bond between a brother and a sister, comes once a year but at times proves to be a bit heavy on the pockets. So this festive season, be a smart shopper. Here are few experts talking about affordable shopping and smart shopping this Raksha Bandhan.

Maintain a ‘To-Do List’: Nidhi Mehra, who’s an ace designer from Delhi, believes to maintain a ‘To-Do List’ for the festival, which will help you spend less and save more. Preparing an informed list of things you are supposed to buy will make you do selective shopping and one can just focus on the important things to buy. This will help you not to spend on things that you regret after purchasing.

Invest on ‘Gift Vouchers’: Spending a designated amount on vouchers and gifting it to your siblings is one of the convenient methods of gifting. Buying a gift which has no or less utility factor for the other person will not just make you feel bad but your money will get wasted. Samiksha Bajaj, founder of Samshek, an online portal which helps you customise your clothes, said, “Gifting your sister an online voucher for shopping will help her shop the best dress or anything of her choice. This will satisfy you as well as your sister will always be thankful for the gift.”

Shop around the ‘Season of Discounts’: Avneet Chadha, a fashion stylist, said “Buying products or gifts at the time of discounts will save a lot of your money. After GST, the tax on many products has increased, but if you buy products at the time of discounts you can save that extra tax you pay. This smart shopping will indeed turn into an affordable shopping.”

‘Do It Yourself’ or DIY: ‘The DIY (Do It Yourself) method is the best way of affordable shopping, said jewellery designer, Rashma Sud. Be it a jewellery or a dress or even shoes will require you to spend some extra bucks on packaging. Designing gift boxes from old stuff kept at your home will save your cost and will also give an emotional feel to the gift which will always be remembered by your loved ones.

These tips will not only help you to save some extra money but will make you a smart buyer.

"The Big Sick movie review: Kumail Nanjiani, Anupam Kher star in the must-see rom-com of 2017","That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.

It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine, you’re not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer.

At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who audiences might know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.

Kumail is a struggling stand-up comedian who pays the rent for his awful Chicago apartment by driving for Uber. When he’s not on the stage, or in the car, he’s at home with his family in the suburbs. They’re Pakistani and Muslim and have all had arranged marriages and expect Kumail to do the same. He’s managed to live a bit of a double life for a while - dating who he wants while also holding up the pretense of being a good Pakistani son. But everything changes when he meets Emily, the white grad student who he falls for and then loses when she realizes that he’s been hiding her from his family.

To be fair, they would literally disown him if he chose Emily over the scores of Pakistani ladies that “just drop by” their family dinners like clockwork, headshot and bio in hand. So Emily and Kumail break up. They have to. It’s a standard rom-com beat and obstacle. But then something happens: Kumail gets the call that Emily has been hospitalized, and the movie pivots into something entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre.

Suddenly he’s the one making the call to put her in a medically induced coma while also informing her parents, Terry and Beth (Ray Romano and Holly Hunter) of their daughter’s health turn. Beth is none too happy to have her daughter’s ex-boyfriend lurking around during their family crisis, either. Hunter plays Beth, at first, with that scary and all too recognizable indifference of a mother who doesn’t care to humour the man who hurt her daughter. But, like everything, that evolves.

One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.

If there is anything to pick on, it’s that we never get to know Emily as well as Kumail. It’s not her fault, she’s in a coma for most of the film, and we get a fair amount of colour at the beginning, but her arc leaves a bit to be desired.

Michael Showalter’s direction isn’t flashy or stylish, either. His camera is there in service of the story and the characters and it doesn’t get in the way.

Some stories are too good to be true, and some true stories are too good for the movies. Luckily for us, The Big Sick is neither.

Netherlands pip Denmark 4-2 in UEFA Women’s Euro 2017 final to lift maiden title,"Striker Vivianne Miedema scored twice on Sunday as the Netherlands beat Denmark 4-2 to win their first ever UEFA Women’s European Championship title and set off a huge party among thousands of orange-clad fans.

The success of the Dutch women’s team at UEFA Women’s Euro 2017 is in stark contrast to the country’s men, who failed to qualify for last year’s European Championship in France and is struggling to reach next year’s World Cup in Russia.

It was a disappointing end to the tournament for Denmark, which knocked out six-time defending champion Germany in the quarterfinals and reached its first final after losing five previous semifinals.

The game started well for the Danes, when striker Nadia Nadim - a former refugee from Afghanistan whose father was killed by the Taliban - converted a sixth-minute penalty after Kika van Es clumsily brought down Sanne Troelsgaard in the area.

The Dutch fans did not have to wait long for their team to draw level.

A long ball by midfielder Jackie Groenen launched right winger Shanice van de Sanden and her low cross was met by Miedema for her third goal in as many matches in the knockout stage of the tournament.

Left winger Lieke Martens, named player of the tournament after the match, put the Dutch ahead in the 28th when she drifted into the center, turned a defender and fired a low shot past goalkeeper Stina Lykke Petersen.

Five minutes later, Denmark was back on terms at 2-2 when captain Pernille Harder overcame the Dutch offside trap and then beat Sari van Veenendaal at her near post with a well-placed shot.

Captain Sherida Spitse restored the Dutch lead after the break with a free kick that rolled wide of the wall and into the corner. Miedema, who had been criticized for not scoring in the group stage, sealed the victory in the 89th with her second goal of the final.

The frenetic match was played in front of a sell-out crowd of more than 28,000 fans, including Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik, at FC Twente’s stadium in the eastern city of Enschede. Also in the crowd was Marco van Basten, the star of the Dutch men’s team that won the 1988 European Championship."
Okja movie review: The first great film of 2017 has arrived. Protect it fiercely. 5 stars,"Okja

Director - Bong Joon-ho

Cast - Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins

Rating - 5/5

If getting booed at the Cannes Film Festival is considered a badge of honour, it is a badge Okja must wear with pride.

It joins a list of films – a list that will probably have you performing an almost comical double-take in a moment – that for various bizarre reasons, found themselves at the receiving end of the famously snooty French crowd’s ire.

In ’76, it was Martin Scorsese’s bleak and brutal Taxi Driver. In ’94, it was Quentin Tarantino’s cultural watershed Pulp Fiction. And in 2011, it was Terrence Malick’s masterpiece, The Tree of Life. Each of these classics was heckled at their Cannes screenings. And each of these films, despite the heckling, won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.

In 2017, the honour (the booing, but sadly not the Palme) went to Okja, the new film by cult South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho – although for reasons we’ve never heard before. Despite ending with one of the most unexpectedly forceful tonal shifts in recent memory – the film goes from being a magical, Miyazaki-esque fable, to a horrifying skewering of mankind in the space of 30 minutes – the most controversial moment in Okja’s Cannes premiere came before it even began. When the Netflix logo ‘duh-dum-ed’ its way onto the screen, the old-school crowd let its disapproval (and fear of the future) be known. Critic David Ehrlich, tweeting from inside the Palais, described it as a ‘prison riot environment.’

It’s natural, as spoiled, needy human beings, for us to want better, never satisfied with what we have. Similarly, it is natural, while the glorious Okja unfolds before your eyes, to wonder just how different it would be on a big screen. Would it be better? Would it be worse? Would the lush Korean landscapes be more breathtaking? Or would the cracks in the CGI be more visible?

Tilda Swinton as Lucy Mirando in OKJA

We will never know. And that is OK. Because despite making the cardinal sin of not being made available to your local multiplex, Okja does what most event movies and summer blockbusters, proudly shot in IMAX, can’t. It cares about its characters, its tone, its craft, and it has enough confidence in you, the audience, to stick with it, even when it becomes too challenging, and even when the mirror it holds up to your face reveals all the blemishes you’ve been trying to hide.

Its story begins several years ago, in a colourful prologue. Tilda Swinton plays the CEO of a powerful multi-national corporation, who, with great fanfare, announces the discovery of a new pig-like creature that her company will breed, and then ship off to 26 far-flung corners of the world, to live with local farmers.

10 years later, in a remote mountain-top farm in South Korea, one of the creatures, now grown up, bounds across the gorgeous countryside, a young girl by its side. She is Mija, the granddaughter of one of the farmers chosen to care for the animal, and she has named it, also a girl, Okja. This is their world. It is all they have. And it is all they need.

Wordlessly, with the aid of some truly wonderful creature design and visual effects, Bong conveys the essence of his film these opening scenes. It is a story about nature and nurture. It is a story about being an innocent child trapped in a harsh world run by adults who’ve been ruined by it, by greed, and by success.

But above all else, it is a story about the evil of mankind, and the depths to which we are capable of sinking. Much like his previous movie, the monumentally underrated Snowpiercer (another film in which he gave Tilda Swinton a memorably despicable character to play), Okja, too is a science fiction story, just as nihilistic, just as furious at our hypocrisy, and just as unforgettable.

OKJA

Like Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, it addresses real-life horrors by replacing images seared into our minds with fantasy, with animals, and with humour.

And fantasy is what Mija needs, when one day, a sweaty, moustachioed, obnoxious American hikes up to her farm. He is Dr Johnny Wilcox, employee of the Tilda Swinton’s MNC, played by a screechingly over-the-top Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes bearing terrible news. In one fell swoop, he destroys Mija’s world. He has come to take Okja away from her.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox in Okja.

Mija’s grandfather, a poor farmer, has already made the deal. It’ll keep food on their bellies. Perhaps it’ll pay for her education too. He’s only coming through the promise he made to her dead parents. He’s taking care of their daughter.

But Mija isn’t the sort of girl to take injustice lying down. She isn’t the sort of girl to resign herself to her fate – or to let Okja fall prey to hers. She packs a bag, breaks open her piggy bank, and journeys across the world to New York, where she plans to break into the headquarters of the Mirando Corporation, and rescue Okja.

Along the way, she is joined by members of the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), played by Paul Dano, Lilly Collins and Steven Yeun, who, despite having their own twisted agenda, are the closest the film comes to having decent people (besides Mija, of course).

OKJA

In a fair world, Okja would have the power to make even the most belligerent meat eaters consider vegetarianism. It would make us question the truths we ignorantly accept. It would make us seek answers, challenge the consumerist culture we so blindly embrace. It would inspire change. But – and Okja would be the first to remind us of this – the world is hardly a fair place.

As an animal lover, I wouldn’t wish the very particular emotional jolt this movie delivers on my worst enemy. Be warned: There is very little hope here. There is only bleakness. But there’s no turning away from Okja. We must spread word about it. We must champion it. Because it is the first great film of 2017.

Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.

The Commuter Pig Keeper named the Oddest Book Title of 2017,"A public vote has determined Michaela Giles’ The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity as the winner of the Diagram Prize for Oddest Book Title of the Year.

Organised by book industry publication The Bookseller, the prize is now in its 39th edition, having been conceived in 1978 as an antidote to boredom at the Frankfurt Book Fair, according to organisers. In the inaugural edition, it was “Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice” that earned the distinction.

This year, a public vote placed The Commuter Pig Keeper on top with 40% of the vote, followed by Renniks Australian Pre-Decimal & Decimal Coin Errors, Nipples on my Knee by Graham and Debra Robertson, An Ape’s View of Human Evolution by Peter Andrews and Love Your Lady Landscape: Trust Your Gut, Care for ‘Down There’ and Reclaim Your Fierce and Feminine SHE by Lisa Lister.

The Bookseller’s Horace Bent, administrator of the prize since 1982, called the top title a “classic” win, noting it “reflects Diagram voters’ long-held love-bordering on unhealthy obsession-of titles with farming or animal husbandry themes.”

Ravindra Jadeja spins India to innings-win over Sri Lanka in Colombo Test,"Ravindra Jadeja picked up a five-wicket haul to help India wrap up the series by completing an innings and 53-run win over Sri Lanka on the fourth afternoon of the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo on Sunday. (LIVE BLOG)

The demolition came in the midst of a dream run for India which started at this venue two years ago, August 2015, when they nailed Sri Lanka 2-1 in a hard-fought contest. Since then, they have vanquished every opponent, beating South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia, with this being their eighth successive series win. (LIVE SCORECARD)

Following-on after conceding a 439-run lead, Sri Lanka were all out for 386 runs. Before the bowlers took over, India’s fourth-wicket pair of Cheteshwar Pujara (133 runs) and Ajinkya Rahane (132) and strong contributions from the lower-order had taken the game beyond the home team by amassing 622 for nine declared after Virat Kohli had won a crucial toss and elected to bat.

Having clinched the first two Tests of the series, the third Test at Kandy has been reduced to a dead rubber.

After crashing to a 304-run defeat in the first Test and being shot out for just 183 in the first essay, Sri Lanka finally showed some fight in the second innings, fighting displays by opener Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis stretching the game to the second session of the fourth day. The opening batsman scored a dogged 141, and Kusal Mendis hit a counter-attacking 110. But, it will be of little consolation for the hosts, reduced to whipping boys by their dominant neighbours.

After struggling against the off-spin of R Ashwin in the first essay, the Sri Lankan batsmen found the going tough against the left-arm spin of Jadeja on Sunday. Jadeja came to the fore when Dimuth Karunaratne and Angelo Mathews looked good to take the fight to the visitors. He first had the left-handed opening batsman at the score of 141, who had no chance on the ball which exploded off the spot.

One of the most experienced batsmen in the Sri Lanka ranks, Karunaratne’s wicket was crucial for Sri Lanka’s chances to save the second Test.

Next over Jadeja had Mathews caught behind and followed it with the scalp of Dilruwan Perea for his fourth wicket of the innings to reduce the hosts to 327 for seven. Ajinkya Rahane pulled of a low catch in front of him off Dhananjaya de Silva to help Jadeja complete the fifer.

Earlier, in the morning, Jadeja had prized out captain Dinesh Chandimal for just two runs. Jadeja would have ended Sri Lanka’s resistance much earlier but KL Rahul spilled a straight forward chance offered by Karunaratne when he added just three runs to his overnight score of 92.

At the lunch break, there would have been some doubts in the Indian dressing room when Sri Lanka were just 137 runs short of making India bat again, and another good session would have had Virat Kohli’s team ruing the decision to enforce the follow-on.

But, the self-belief in this team is strong enough to tide over any situation, and once they got the breakthrough, it was over in a jiffy. It has been an all-round team effort and most satisfied will be new chief coach Ravi Shastri, for whom it is the first assignment of his new innings with the Indian team."
"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."
"Virat Kohli says Colombo pitch, big lead prompted him to enforce follow-on","Ravindra Jadeja ended with five wickets in the second innings as India won the second Test by an innings and 53 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 in the three match series, in Colombo on Sunday. (SL vs IND HIGHLIGHTS)

It was an all-round display by Virat Kohli’s men who capitalised on their big lead to dictate the course of the game. If Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara had done the job with the bat, Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin ensured they executed their roles well; both picking up seven wickets each in the match. (SL vs IND SCORES)

“The way the wicket was getting worse by the day and the lead of more than 440 runs prompted us to enforce the follow-on. I haven’t been a big fan of follow ons, though. At international level, you expect teams to come out and play like that (on Kusal Mendis’ and Dimuth Karunaratne’s innings). They batted really well,” Kohli said at the end of the match.

(Read | Dimuth Karunaratne’s ton in vain as India crush Sri Lanka to seal series 2-0)

Both Kusal Mendis (110) and Dimuth Karunaratne (141) scored tons to help the hosts put up a modest fight but trailing by 439 runs, even they knew the going would only get tougher. India had a 309-run first-innings lead in the first Test as well but decided against enforcing the follow on and piled up another 240 runs before winning the Test by 304 runs.

The skipper also showered praise on wicketkeeper Wridhhiman Saha who had three scalps. On a pitch that provided a fair amount of turn to both Ashwin and Jadeja, Saha put up a terrific show behind the stumps.

“Just four byes on that sort of a pitch speaks of his (Saha’s) quality. He is definitely the best keeper in this format. How agile he is! He is very safe behind the stumps. Our batting was outstanding again. Pujara and Rahane — our two best Test batsmen — Rahul getting runs and Jadeja contributing down the order,” he added."
"Happy Friendship Day 2017: With friends like these 5 movie characters, who needs enemies?","It is an unwritten law that every year when Friendship Day rolls around, we are supposed to celebrate everything great. Best quotes, best songs, best movies, best books, etc... the list goes on. But does anyone take the time and jot down all that is annoying about friends? If we’re all being honest, they can be a little needy at times, and is it really that big a deal if you forget a birthday or two?

No. It isn’t. And keeping with this surly spirit, let’s take a look at some of the worst best friends we’ve seen in movies - the sort of people who’d never bail you out of jail, who’ll probably leave you stranded at a sketchy street corner after an argument, the sort of people who like pineapple on their pizza.

But little did they know that one of their number would grow up to be a vile little backstabbing coward. Pettigrew’s Judas-like betrayal of Harry Potter’s father sent ripples down the saga, but he got his comeuppance in the end.

Not only would Tyler Durden (Fight Club) coerce you into stealing human fat to make soap, he would brainwash you into being horrible to your girlfriend, losing your job, and founding a terrorist outfit. And then, just to rub it all in, he’d disappear off the face of the Earth.

3. Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams

While we’ve seen dozens of characters like Regina from Mean Girls, Regina embodies the worst of them all - almost as if she’s invited them over for a sleepover, and during the night, eaten their brains for dinner.

2. Danny McBride, played by Danny McBride

The ease with which Danny McBride plays a terrible friend makes us wonder if he’s even acting in the first place. And his playing a character named Danny McBride in This is the End didn’t help. Also, he brings up raping Emma Watson. That’s not very friendly.

Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Or, use these buttons.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

Prakash Nanjappa sets new targets ahead of 2020 Tokyo Olympics,"Prakash Nanjappa, international pistol shooter, has made radical innovations to his training plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Among them is having a full-time coach.

The day after he was recommended for the prestigious Arjuna Award, the Olympian said: “I have made overall changes in my training to cut down on error during competitions. It is a challenging task, but I am enjoying the routine.”

Firstly, he has shifted his focus to the 10-metre air pistol event since the 50m free pistol has been scrapped from the next Olympic Games. At the Rio Games, he finished 25th in the 50m event with a score of 547.

Secondly, he has changed his weapon. “All the changes collectively should help me polish my skills. I have changed my technique with an aim to be more consistent at the global level,” he added.

The pistol shooter though has chalked out plans with his South Korean coach Kim Seon-Il, a former coach with the Korean national team. Prior to the Rio Games, the Korean expert was helping him occasionally, but now he is based in Pune.

The Bangalore-based shooter wants to make an impact in the 2018 Commonwealth Games in April and Asian Games in September. He is also targeting the 2018 ISSF World Championship at Changwon, South Korea (Aug 31 to Sep14). It will be the first qualification tournament for Tokyo Olympic Games.

Winner of silver medal in 10m air pistol at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, he wants gold this time at Gold Coast, Australia. “I am ranked among the top three or four in the country. I need to sustain my efforts to stay atop the field. There are some youngsters coming up but I am focussed. Next year is important,” he said.

“I have sponsors so I don’t need to worry about the money. It will help me get the right kind of international exposure in the build up to tournaments. I also have plans to train in Korea before the Worlds,” he said.

“My coach wants me to stay calm. It is sinking gradually into my system,” he said."

Eunice de Souza (1940-2017): No Tears in the Eye of the Storm,"Eunice de Souza (1940-2017) never had the slightest patience with the claims of a normality imposed by consensus or authority. Not one to be trapped in a ghetto, whether ethnic, academic or political, she early embraced the rapture of all that was strange and liberating. In her poem ‘Return’, she revisits the moment when she first heard the French Jesuit and translator Guy Deleury, then resident at the Christa Prema Seva Ashram, read the Marathi saint-poet Tukaram’s abhangas:

Tuka, forgive my familiarity.

I have loved your pithy verses

ever since that French priest

everyone thought mad

recited them, and told us

of his journey with your people.

…

You made life hard for your wife

and I’m not sure I approve of that.

Nor did you heed her last request:

Come back soon.

Deleury, with his lifelong devotion to Tukaram and to India’s Bhakti literature of ecstasy and protest, was an emancipatory part of de Souza’s growing up in Poona, where she was born in 1940. Demonstrating her refusal to conform to what she experienced as the stifling pieties and norms of her Goan Catholic birth community, she sought out unusual, even eccentric figures like Deleury (who later renounced his priestly calling and entered secular life) and the Santiniketan-trained Goan émigré artist Angelo da Fonseca, whose radiant Indianisation of Christian iconography had prompted orthodox opinion to cast him into exterior darkness. Such presences, and the pathways they opened up, nourished de Souza’s imagination.

At the same time, as a young poet and academic, de Souza articulated the difficulties confronted by a woman making her way in the India of the 1960s and 1970s, a postcolonial society in which feudalism and patriarchy continued to dominate public life and the accepted perception of gender destiny. As a student in the Midwest at the beginning of the 1960s, de Souza would surely have caught the thrum of dissidence that would soon challenge the American ascendancy in the name of race, gender and sexual choice during the civil rights movements. Although she returned to India in 1963, these revolutions in thought and practice inspired her at a distance. While the label ‘confessional’ is a reductive and inadequate one, de Souza’s encounter with the work of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Adrienne Rich offered her models of poetry that opened up forms of public expression for women, forms that allowed for the naming and saying of personal experiences that had no place in a patriarchal framework.

Eunice de Souza with former chief minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah at the Goa Art & Literature Festival, 2012. ((Siddesh Mayenkar/Herald Review))

De Souza’s feminism was mapped along a spectrum from the sardonic to the ferocious. Some of her targets were more fortunate than others. Tukaram, loved for his startling and often irreverent poetry of mystical transport, is gently rebuked for his indifference to his wife’s struggles. But in the precisely titled ‘Autobiographical’, de Souza appears to pay the patriarchy back in its own coin before recording the insight that structural violence replicates itself in an internalised counter-violence of the individual that is every bit as corrosive and depleting:

I thought the whole world

was trying to rip me up

cut me down go through me

with a razor blade

then I discovered

a cliché: that’s what I wanted

to do to the world.

In the later ‘Songs of Survival’, she registers a move towards a more stoic, ironic stance, not resignation so much as wisdom:

Practice grave courtesy:

there are no tears in the

eye of the storm.

Survive to know you can.

There is little to be said

for suffering.

It has been tempting for many readers to interpret de Souza’s poetry as the unfolding chronicle of an embattled self constantly crafting idioms of belonging in a hostile world. While this account has its own relevance, a survey of her expanded practice reveals the opposite of self-absorption. Her approach to the world was versatile and founded on a restless curiosity. Throughout her career, de Souza was active as a literary critic, editor, researcher, and columnist. She wrote art criticism for some years, and retained a lively interest in the visual arts. She wrote books for children and compiled benchmark anthologies such as These My Words: The Penguin Book of Indian Poetry, a collaboration with her lifelong friend and colleague Melanie Silgardo.

To mourn de Souza is also to mourn a period and a milieu in Bombay’s cultural life when the arts had not become narrowly professionalised and mutually separated, and when compelling intellectual and artistic synergies exploded across the scene. Writers and painters, architects and filmmakers, activists and advertising professionals met, formed friendships and collegialities, often collaborated, or inspired one another’s enterprises. Poets like Nissim Ezekiel transited between academia and the visual arts. Poets like Arun Kolatkar and Dilip Chitre straddled the worlds of literature and advertising. Poets like Adil Jussawalla were active in academia, journalism and publishing. These cultural experimenters and their contemporaries were responsive to theatre and music, often working together with colleagues to develop work beyond the page. Many of them were engaged in translation, as a bridge between languages and language-universes separated by historical circumstances. They were committed to keeping the transmission lines of literature open, whether through little magazines or small presses, as the splendid recent research of scholars like Laetitia Zecchini and Anjali Nerlekar has shown.

While the Clearing House publishing collective has, correctly, received retrospective acclaim for its role in this history, the 1960s and 1970s were animated by numerous, often intersecting, mutually replenishing reading circles and publishing platforms of varying longevity. Among these were the circle around Nissim Ezekiel at the PEN, the salons that Kamala Das convened, imprints such as Pras Prakashan, and successors to Clearing House such as Newground and Praxis, which published de Souza’s early collections of poetry. The critical, vigorously recalcitrant, self-renewing energies of this background continued to pulse through Eunice de Souza’s work until the very end. Wintry as its wisdom sounds, her last book of poems, Learn from the Almond Leaf, published last year, offers us unquiet, incandescent meditations like ‘A Smattering of Rain’:

A smattering of rain,

Earth lets off steam.

A hawk falls.

A volcano upchucks.

Watch it!

Earth’s heart is still

smouldering.

"India not worried about home or away, winning the sole target: Virat Kohli","The Test series has been as predictable as it can get. India were expected to dominate and Sri Lanka’s below par showing has ensured the contestants have stuck to the script.

On the verge of a rare whitewash in an away series, it’s another performance which will help India build the aura of a champion side. However, to acquire the tag of an all-conquering side, they will have to wait till they beat Australia, England and South Africa in their home conditions, although Virat Kohli’s side has done enough to deserve the world No 1 ranking.

Oozing with confidence after leading his team to an innings win in the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Virat Kohli said for India it was no longer about home or away. They simply want to win every game.

Win anywhere

“Well, it’s obviously nice to win this series again. We won this last time also, in 2015. Yes, we do have that chance (of completing a whitewash). But honestly speaking, we are not looking at Test matches or Test cricket now as home and away anymore. We are just looking at them as Test matches and we want to win anywhere we play.

“If we can believe in our abilities, then we are not really bothered about where we are playing. That kind of energy I can sense in the team; and the team believes that as well. You know, we have to only look to win Tests, on whatever pitch or in whatever conditions. We are creating a habit of winning, that I think can be carried on in future as well,” added Kohli.

“From the numbers point of view and from stats point of view, these things look great, but for us as a team, it’s all about achieving those small little goals every time we go out to play a Test.”

Even though the new appointments in the team’s coaching staff have been with the cycle of the 2019 World Cup, the Indian captain declared Test cricket was his priority. “Test cricket is the most important thing for us. We really feel good as a team that we’re able to win consistently right now, but we realise it’s very important to keep carrying on the same way as well.”

While it can be pointed out India have got the results at home or playing in similar conditions (in the West Indies and Sri Lanka), it has been impressive how they have overcome situations when challenged by the opposition. An example was Sri Lanka’s batting in the second innings on Sunday at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground. Dimuth Karunaratne anchored the innings and at lunch time had brought his team within 137 runs of making India bat again.

Piling the pressure

Kohli and Co didn’t panic and stuck to their plan, creating pressure with the second new ball, which paid dividends. From 310 for four, the hosts crashed to 386 all out.

“It (wicket) was getting slower and that’s why we took the new ball straightaway (in 81st over) as well. We thought with the harder new ball, one might keep straight as well because the older ball was soft and all balls were turning, so it was very difficult to get edges and create chances. The bowlers are in the game as well when there is more pace because of the harder ball. Today, again we spoke about getting those couple of chances and then we can get 4-5 in a session, which ended up happening in the second session.

READ | Ravindra Jadeja spins India to innings-win over Sri Lanka in Colombo Test

“We managed to turn things around and you always feel good as a team when you come back from a difficult situation and win the Test.”

There was some debate over enforcing the follow-on. While admitting it was risky to be left chasing in the fourth innings, Kohli said with a lead of 439 and a helpful track, they had no hesitation in putting Sri Lanka in again.

“A lead of 440, and looking at the wicket the way it was spinning, not to bat again. And we had only bowled 40 or 48 overs in the first innings. So, the bowlers were fresh and we got the lunch break in between as well, which is 40 minutes. So, all those things taken into consideration, we ended up enforcing the follow on.”"
"THE CLASS OF 2018: An ""urgent requirement"": Where are the teachers?","Transfer trickery

Teacher transfers have long been a source of contention between the Department of Education and the teachers union. Transfers are frequent in most government jobs, but Delhi's teachers are assigned a school when they join the service and most are required to move only once in their careers, when they are promoted to the grade of lecturer. Teachers unhappy with their assigned schools, however, may apply for transfers, which are usually accepted if there is a vacancy.

Delhi's schools have only 34,681 permanent teachers for 61,674 posts, so a teacher looking to move invariably finds an empty slot. The city also employs almost 17,000 guest teachers on short-term contracts, meaning that there are around 10,000 real vacancies. But since the posts held by contract teachers are counted as ""vacant"" for the purposes of a transfer, permanent teachers assigned to overcrowded, inaccessible schools like Sangam Vihar often try to leave at the first chance they get.

Earlier this year, the government identified the 311 ""urgent requirement"" schools where the shortage of teachers was so acute that teachers would be assigned there on a priority basis. Any teacher sent to such a school would have to stay for a minimum of two years before seeking a transfer, and any request for a transfer into these schools was to be automatically granted. The situation in C-block Sangam Vihar is so dire that the school is part of a special subset of 11 most ""most urgent"" schools in all of Delhi.

Yet Bhram Dev Sharma, Anuj's maths teacher, was assigned to the pahadi school in February this year and transferred out just five months later.

""That is because I transferred to another 'most urgent' school,"" Sharma said. ""Transfers between most-urgent category schools are permitted."" Senior officials in government admitted they had not foreseen this loophole when they framed the rules.

Sharma said he enjoyed teaching in Sangam Vihar but found it impossible to commute to the school. ""I would spend two hours a day on the road,"" he said. ""My mother is old; I need to look after her.""

His new school, in Malviya Nagar, was also short of teachers, Sharma said. ""Are you telling me that only Sangam Vihar's students deserve a maths teacher? That the students of Malviya Nagar don't deserve a maths teacher?""

Other teachers were more sceptical of the transfer process. ""The one with a stick controls the buffalo,"" said one teacher at the pahadi school. ""If you have good connections, you never get posted to Sangam Vihar. If you have some connections, you get posted here but get transferred out.

""And if you have no connections, you end up here and your transfer request is declined because Sangam Vihar doesn't have enough teachers.""

Delhi's education department is struggling to assign teachers to the Pahadi school, despite designating it a ""urgent requirement"" category school.

Teacher trouble

Why doesn't Delhi have more teachers?

Atishi Marlena, special advisor to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, said the reliance on contract teachers and the dearth of teachers overall were consequences of the fifth pay commission of 1992-93. It substantially raised salaries of all government employees, leading successive administrations in Delhi to hire contract teachers, who could be paid lower wages.

The current government does not want to hire any more contract teachers, but it does want more permanent teachers. In 2015, the city raised education spending to 25% of the annual budget and sought to hire 9,623 regular teachers from the pool of 16,747 contract staff on their rolls. But government rules mandate that recruitments be done through an entrance exam open to all eligible candidates. When the posts were advertised, 140,000 people applied. The government realised that serving contract teachers, who work long shifts, would struggle to compete against the legion of young Indians who devote the first few years of their working lives to applying for government jobs.

""We asked the selection board for a points-based weightage for contract teachers based on their years of service,"" Marlena said. The proposal was initially turned down by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, but it is now under consideration once more after the Supreme Court upheld the validity of giving weightage to contract employees in an unrelated case.

In the meantime, the Delhi government is looking for provisional fixes. A senior official said the government was forming a panel of guest teachers who could be deployed anywhere at short notice and establishing a shuttle service to help teachers commute to the eight most inconvenient schools — including the pahadi school.

The shortage of teachers has forced Sangam Vihar to shorten the school day and eliminate all games periods.

Fun once a year

When a school is short-staffed, each teacher must fulfil numerous roles. Because the pahadi school has 25% fewer teachers than it is supposed to, it has reduced the length of the school day and the number of periods from eight to six, making the class schedule denser and simpler.

A middle school social studies teacher has been drafted to help teach physical education. But the school is already short one social studies teacher, so the drawing teacher is teaching social studies to help out. Which means the school doesn't have drawing classes either.

""We've made a separate extracurricular timetable in which we try to ensure each students gets at least some time to play every once in a while,"" Yadav said.

Anuj, the science student, and his brothers have wildly divergent experiences in the same schooling system. His elder brother, Atul, who went to a similar school, discovered a love for painting. Where a student in an elite school would be mentored for a possible future career as an artist or a designer, Atul was told not to waste his time.

""Our school didn't have an art teacher either,"" he said. ""Whenever there was an art competition, the teacher would chose her favourite student and send him. The rest of us were given no training.""

Jatin, the youngest of the brothers, studies at a government school in Saket, a prosperous residential area. His experiences offer a glimpse of all that is possible when the misaligned gears of government schooling click into place.

""Our school has everything,"" Jatin said one morning as he dressed for school. ""We have a cricket ground, we have basketball courts, we even have hockey coaching.""

Two weeks ago, Anuj's physical education teacher set aside his textbook and took the boys out to a dusty courtyard that stands in for the school playground. It was the class's first games period of the year.

""We played volleyball,"" Anuj said, ""It was amazing. Last year, we didn't have a single games period.""

""I study,"" he said. ""But sometimes I wish we had something to keep our minds fresh. To relax, and not think of our exams."""
India vs Sri Lanka: Ravindra Jadeja fifer helps IND beat SL in Colombo Test,"For those surprised by how Indian cricket team’s Ravindra Jadeja is the No 1 ranked Test bowler, the left-arm spinner provided a good proof with a five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka in the second innings of the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo on Sunday. (SL vs IND, Day 4 Highlights)

With Sri Lanka national cricket team showing resolve to slug it out in the morning session, there was some pressure on the Indian bowlers as they came out after lunch. (SL vs IND, Day 4 Full scorecard)

Jadeja came to the fore, and his five wickets for 152,, helped India to a innings and 53 runs victory.

Jadeja came in when Dimuth Karunaratne and Angelo Mathews looked good to take the fight to the visitors. He first had Karunaratne at the score of 141, who had no chance on the ball which exploded off the spot.

One of the most experienced batsmen in the Sri Lanka ranks, Karunaratne’s wicket was crucial for Sri Lanka hopes to save the second Test.

In the next over, Jadeja had Mathews caught behind and followed it with the scalp of Dilruwan Perea for his fourth wicket of the innings to reduce the hosts to 327 for seven. Ajinkya Rahane pulled off a low catch off Dhannanjay de Silva’s edge to give Jadeja his fifth wicket.

Earlier, in the morning, Jadeja had prized out captain Dinesh Chandimal for just two runs. Jadeja would have ended Sri Lanka’s resistance much earlier but KL Rahul dropped a sitter off Karunaratne when he was on 95.

In the first innings, he had completed 150 wickets in Test cricket with two wickets in 32 Tests. He is the fastest left-arm bowler to the mark."
"No more jet, set, go. Travelling is set to get expensive in 2018","If you’re planning a big trip in 2018 you might want to start saving up now, as the findings of a new report predict that travel prices will rise sharply across air, hotel and ground transportation next year.

The reason? A stronger global economy, higher oil prices and rising demand from emerging markets, say analysts in the 2018 Global Travel Forecast, released jointly this week by global travel management company Carlson Wagonlit Travel, and The Global Business Travel Association Foundation.

“The higher pricing is a reflection of the stronger economy and growing demand,” said Carlson Wagonlit president and CEO Kurt Ekert in a statement. “The global numbers from this forecast should be considered strong leading indicators of what 2018 will mean for global businesses, as we anticipate higher spending.”

The sector that will see the biggest global increase is hotels, with average prices forecast to rise nearly 4%. In Western Europe that figure is expected to spike 6 percent, led notably by Norway, where hotel rates will increase 14%. When it comes to flights, travellers will likewise shell out more next year, with rising crude oil prices expected to drive up the cost of global airfares by 3.5%.

And what travellers bound for Eastern Europe save on hotel prices, they’ll likely spend on increased airfare, with prices forecast to rise 7%. Likewise, travel to Western Europe will also be about 6 percent more expensive. Airfares for North America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa will see modest rises of about 2 to 3%, while prices for travel to Latin America and the Caribbean will stay stagnant.

And while global prices for ground transportation are expected to rise slightly to one percent, that figure shoots up to nearly five percent for Canada.

Kusal Mendis leads Sri Lanka’s grim fight vs India in Colombo with classy ton,"Kusal Mendis smashed an attacking century (120 balls, 16 fours) to give this Indian side the first glimpse of the talent the 22-year-old Sri Lankan batsman is blessed with. Being termed as the next big thing in Sri Lanka cricket, Mendis blazed away to a hundred on the third day of the second Test on Saturday, using the horizontal-batted shots to good effect against the spinners, at the homeground of Mahela Jayawardene, whose role he is tipped to perform in the team and become the lynchpin of batting. (Day 3 updates | Scorecard)

The test of all good players is how they measure up under pressure, and though Mendis had started poorly against India, all three of his hundreds of his budding career have been impressive because they have come when his team is in trouble.

Kusal Mendis gets his 3rd Test century! 100* (120b) SL 183 & 176/1 (46.0 Ovs) Sri Lanka trail by 263 runs. https://t.co/U9icN1eKqE #SLvIND pic.twitter.com/CTlYhqRLCU — Sri Lanka Cricket (@OfficialSLC) August 5, 2017

Mendis announced his arrival with a stunning century against Australia in his seventh Test, a game-changing 176 in the second essay in 2016. His second was a match-winning 194 against Bangladesh at Galle in March this year.

He had looked good in the second innings at Galle, getting a 36 before absent-mindedly following a Jadeja delivery to get a faint edge. In the first innings of the second Test here he was again faulted for a lack of application, lofting a catch to mid-on with his team in trouble.

100 for Kusal Mendis! A fantastic knock with Sri Lanka following on. His third Test century #SLvInd pic.twitter.com/UmpU6TkJfS — ICC (@ICC) August 5, 2017

Even though it may not have a bearing on the result of the game, the hundred against the world’s top-ranked side on Saturday evening will do a world of good to Mendis’ confidence.

Sri Lanka’s second innings too started on a poor note when Upul Tharanga was bowled by Umesh Yadav in the third over. However, Mendis came in and straightaway went for his shots. He put off the threat of R Ashwin by targeting the midwicket region, using the cross-batted shot to good effect whenever the spinner gave air."
North Delhi municipal body to set up new debris processing plant by 2018,"For the scientific disposal of construction and demolition waste, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to establish another plant at Rani Khera, by March 2018.

The civic agency has already received bids for the design and establishment of the C&D waste plant on a 3.55 acres land near Rohini. The land was transferred to North DMC by the Delhi Development Authority last year.

Officials said the contractor will be also responsible for collection and processing of C&D waste from areas under Civil Lines, Rohini and Narela zone.

“Work will start on the project as soon as the new standing committee is constituted and sanctions permission. Then, it will take six months for the agency to establish the plant and start processing and management of C&D waste,” said senior North body official.

The project will be established on build-operate-transfer basis for a period of 15 years.

“During the period, the contractor would be allowed to recycle and convert the waste into products such as sand, aggregates, slabs and sell them. After that the whole establishment will be owned by us,” said Praveen Gupta, commissioner, North corporation.

During the initial phase, 1,000 metric tonnes of waste would be treated there every day and after a year, the capacity of the plant will be increased to 1,500 metric tonnes per day.

“The plant will solve the problem of untreated waste which is collected from various locations and dumped at the landfill,” said the official.

Currently, around 4,000 metric tonnes of waste is generated in all six zones under the North DMC every day. Out of this, 2,000 metric tonne is transported from various locations at Karol Bagh City and Sadar Paharganj to the existing C&D waste plant at Burari, while the rest goes to the Bawana and Bhalswa landfills.

In February, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had also directed the North DMC to set up its second C&D plant at Rani Khera, after DDA allotted a land to the civic body for the purpose.

“To date, 30 lakh metric tonne of construction and demolition waste has been recycled at the Burari plant,” said Gupta. According to him, at Rani Khera plant the contractor will use the same technology for converting C&D waste into useful products."
"Congress’s Kisan Sammelan to test its unity, poll readiness for 2018","Congress’s Kisan Sammelan (farmers’ convention) in Lahaar of Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district, close to Gwalior, will signal its readiness for the 2018 assembly polls and also whether the party’s ‘Dabra’ spirit can be revived.

The ‘Dabra’ spirit is the holy grail for Congress unity. In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.

The parallels are obvious. The ‘show’ at Laahar will be Madhavrao’s son, Jyotiraditya’s, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.

The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.

Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singh’s constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.

Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, “Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.”

Loud and Visible

The preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.

Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.

Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindia’s rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.

Tapping into Farmers’ Anger

With the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers’ crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.

There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.

State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers’ issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. “It started with Scindiaji’s satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.”

After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singh’s constituency.

BJP puts up brave front

The BJP too realises the Congress’s game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers’ anger through a slew of measures — visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.

The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.

BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.

“They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers,” he said."

"India put away the sweep shot, Sri Lanka swear by it in Colombo Test","Seldom have we seen two teams employing completely contrasting batting plans to tackle the same conditions. Despite Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane dominating Sri Lanka’s spin attack by using their feet well, it was interesting to watch the home batsmen play cross-batted shots against R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. And they did that successfully with Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis both getting hundreds.

“After the second day’s play we felt it was tough to bat on it (this wicket). We tried to play straight but couldn’t score well. Before the second innings we had a discussion on what was the best way to score runs. Everyone agreed, moving forward it was using the sweep and reverse sweep heavily. We executed really well in the second innings. We fought back hard,” said Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, explaining his team’s strategy.

High-risk shot

Talking about the contrast in approach, India captain Virat Kohli said everyone has his own strengths. But for him, sweep remained a high-risk shot.

“People play in different ways and I don’t think they drove even a single ball. There was no driving on that pitch. My approach or Ajinkya’s or Pujara’s might be very different, so it’s all about finding ways to score. It happens in cricket sometimes that you play a particular shot and suddenly it becomes productive in that particular innings for you.

READ | India not worried about home or away, winning the sole target: Virat Kohli

“But as soon as you get out, then you start thinking twice because it is a high risk shot, to be honest, against the pace of Jadeja, especially for the right-hander. But it (Mendis) was a high-quality innings, not one sweep was mistimed or misconnected or in the air. So, we have to give credit to the batters.”

The most disappointing for Sri Lanka has been the inability of their spinners to make an impression on the Indian batsmen, especially with the best left-arm spinner in Rangana Herath in their ranks.

Mathews only bats

“At the moment we have two experienced bowlers, Rangana and Dilruwan Perera. We had a wicket that turned and we expected them to come to the fore. But we couldn’t execute those plans in this game,” said Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal.

Sri Lanka chose only one pacer, and when Nuwan Pradeep got injured, Chandimal was left with only spinners. In Angelo Mathews, he has a terrific seam-bowling all-rounder, but for a while now on his physio’s advice, Mathews is only playing as a specialist batsman following a hamstring injury.

READ | Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja spell double trouble for Sri Lanka

Chandimal said Angelo not being able to bowl was a massive loss. “Angelo used to bowl in the last five-six years and he gave us a good balance. It’s a massive loss if you want to get the combination right.”"

"Six TMC MLAs rebel, BJP set to be main opposition in Tripura ahead of 2018 polls","Agartala The 60-member Tripura assembly, dominated by communists for decades, is set to get a tinge of saffron with six MLAs of Trinamool Congress (TMC) scheduled to join the Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday.

TMC had axed the six MLAs, who had in June 2016 crossed over from the Congress, for anti-party activities after they decided to vote for Ram Nath Kovind, then the NDA’s nominee for President.

The formal joining will be a bonus for BJP ahead of the assembly polls scheduled in the first half of 2018. The BJP has never won an assembly in the Marxist-ruled state with the CPI-M and other Left Front constituents accounting for 51 members in the current assembly.

The TMC legislators led by Sudip Roy Barman met BJP chief Amit Shah in New Delhi on August 5. Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP’s Tripura in-charge Sunil Deodhar and state president Biplab Kumar Deb were present in the meeting.

“Meeting of Amit Shah with the MLAs was just a courtesy. They would join BJP today during a rally near (Tripura capital Agartala’s) Rabindra Shatabarshiki Bhawan,” Deb told HT on phone.

Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, party general secretary Ram Madhab and party’s Northeast general secretary Ajay Jamwal would be present in the joining programme besides Sarma, Deodhar and Deb.

Many TMC members from different parts of the state are also expected to join BJP along with the six TMC legislators, Deb said.

Days after TMC general secretary Partha Chatterjee de-recognised the six, they cast their votes in favour of Kovind on July 17. Congress MLA Ratan Lal Nath voted for Kovind too.

The BJP had earlier had set a deadline for nine opposition MLAs (six from Trinamool Congress and three from Congress) to join the party by May 31 without any precondition. Otherwise, they would field their own candidates in the nine seats they represent, for the 2018 polls.

Barman and the other five MLAs had joined TMC on June 7 last year protesting against the political understanding between CPM and Congress during West Bengal assembly polls.

Within six months, the TMC new committee was formed under the leadership of Asish Saha. Another dissident leader – DC Hrangkhawl was made Trinamool Congress Legislature Party chief."

Return to Harry Potter makes JK Rowling the world’s richest author in 2017,"We hope JK Rowling has reserved a particularly large vault at Gringotts bank. A bumper year for the Harry Potter novelist has magicked her back to the No 1 spot on Forbes’ list of the world’s richest authors, almost a decade after she last topped it.

Forbes – which uses a mix of print, ebook and audio sales data, television and film earnings and expert industry opinion to come up with its list – estimates that Rowling earned $95m in the year to 31 May. This figure is the equivalent of more than $180 per minute, thanks to the sensational sales of her play script, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. When the Harry Potter sequel was released last summer, it sold more than 680,000 print copies in the UK in the first three days alone, and became the fastest selling book since the final Harry Potter novel.

Rowling’s earnings have been boosted with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film set in the Harry Potter world for which she wrote the script, which was published in November. Her original publisher, Bloomsbury, has also been releasing illustrated versions of the Potter novels, to mark 20 years since the publication of the first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.

Forbes producer Hayley Cuccinello admitted she was surprised to see Rowling’s earnings increase $76m over 12 months, attributing the surge to the recent successes from the Harry Potter franchise on stage and screen. “But unless Rowling releases another bestselling book in time for next year’s list,” said Cuccinello, “her earnings will almost certainly dip dramatically and she’ll likely relinquish first place.” Rowling, who last topped Forbes’ list in 2008, comes in this year $8m ahead of second-placed James Patterson, the thriller powerhouse who has headed the list for the last three years.

"India outplayed us completely, admits Sri Lanka captain Chandimal","about the video

Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja broke the back of Sri Lanka’s resistance after lunch to secure India’s series-clinching victory by an innings and 53 runs in the second Test in Colombo on Sunday. The all-rounder claimed his ninth five-wicket haul as Sri Lanka, forced to follow on after being shot out for 183 in the first innings, made 386 in the second before collapsing minutes before the tea break on the penultimate day. It was a first victory by an innings or more for India in Sri Lanka and, following their biggest victory by runs in Galle last week, ensured an eighth straight series triumph under Virat Kohli.

"France has a target: 10,000 Indian students by year 2020","A world player in arts, design, science and technology, France is Europe’s most innovative country. Ranking at number three among the global top-three in innovation, it is home to numerous Nobel Laureates and Fields Medal winners, artists and thinkers. This year some 4,000 students are going from India to study in France, but by 2019, the country hopes to attract 10,000 Indian students.

“France is first and foremost an experience to be lived,” says Dr. Bertrand de Hartingh, director at Institut français India. “You embrace the future and new technologies, and at the same time, also have a full taste of culture and history.”

Many students who feel their first study destination should be the English-speaking countries such as the US and UK should know that language is not a barrier. Students from India and the world over can study in France in English- or French-medium institutions. If they study in French, then like any other French citizen in French state universities, students benefit from free tuition. “They only have to pay for food, boarding and lodging, which are affordable,” says Dr de Hartingh, who is also also counsellor for cooperation and cultural affairs for the French government.

Once they complete postgraduate studies, Indian students in France have a stay-back option. They have an advantage in terms of job opportunities too. There are also around a thousand French companies that seek skilled professionals in India, including Capgemini, Safran, Saint-Gobain, Renault, and Orange. In fact, CapGemini has more employees in India than in France. “An employee who is well versed in French technology, know-how and culture is an asset for any company operating in India,” says Dr de Hartingh.

France Alumni also connects former students with each other and with French companies, continuing the partnership between India and France. “As young professionals who have experienced French education, students act as our cultural ambassadors in India. The Enterprises-Alumni job fair connects students and professionals who have studied or worked in France to potential employers. Last year over 200 jobs were showcased at the Job Fair in Delhi; this year Bengaluru showcased many more,” he adds.

Applying to France is easy. Campus France has 11 offices offering free counselling to students and help with admission procedures, visa formalities, etc. They are located in the Alliance Françaises in the following cities: Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Kochi, with two opening soon in Indore and Jaipur.

France’s programme “Bonjour India” – now in its third edition from November 2017 to February 2018 - promotes and fosters creativity, innovation and partnership between both countries."

Ravindra Jadeja (Man of the Match): “In the first innings, the ball was not turning that much. When we came onto bowl, we got turn from the middle part of the wicket. Mendis played very well and played some brilliant shots. Yeah, they batted very well. As a spinner, it is always a challenge when a batsman plays a sweep shot on a regular basis. We have to change our field and line and length.”

Virat Kohli: “The way the wicket behaved and how it was getting worse by the day and the lead of more than 440 prompted us to enforce the follow-on. I haven’t been a big fan of enforcing it, though. At international level, you expect teams to come and play like that (on Mendis’ and Dimuth’s innings). They batted really well. You need to have those tough times to improve as cricketers. If you enjoy the hard moments, you enjoy the good moments as well. Never get complacent as a side - that’s important.”

Dinesh Chandimal: “To be honest, you can’t control the toss. We were outplayed with bat and the ball in the first innings. But I was happy with the way we played in the second innings. We just want to take positives from this game. Kusal and Dimuth played some really good cricket.”

10:06 hrs IST: Ravindra Jadeja comes into the attack. He took two wickets in the first innings.

10:05 hrs IST: Steady start from Shami. No margin for error. Sri Lanka 209/2

10:00 hrs IST: Time for live action. Karunaratne to take strike. Shami to bowl the first over.

09:45 hrs IST: ‘The pitch has started to tire, there are plenty of marks and the bowlers can still exploit it. Batsmen can still score runs on this track but a lot of discipline is required’, says Russell Arnold.

09:30 hrs IST: At 22 years, Kusal Mendis is now the youngest Sri Lankan to score a hundred while following-on.

09:20 hrs IST: One final time, the world-record holder furiously pumped the arms and legs on his gangly 6-foot-5 frame, desperately trying to reel in all those would-be winners as the finish line fast approached.

09:00 hrs IST: It should be fair to say Sri Lanka’s ‘sweeping’ success has kept them afloat. Kusal Mendis used the sweep shot to great effect after being asked to follow on.

08:50 hrs IST: A total of 28 sixes have been hit in the series so far, the second most in a Test series in Sri Lanka.

08:30 hrs IST: A warm welcome to HT’s live coverage of Day 4 of the second Test between India - Sri Lanka.

Ravichandran Ashwin was at his sublime best at the start of Day 3 and took three more wickets to get another five-for to ensure that Sri Lanka posted a modest 183 all out in reply to India’s mammoth first innings total of 622.

Things looked to be heading in the same direction when Umesh Yadav dismissed Upul Tharanga early in the second innings. However, Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne’s stand has given Sri Lanka a chance to at least prevent an India win.

On Day 4, India will look to take more wickets and either finish the game off in this innings itself or ensure that Sri Lanka don’t set them a big target for the final innings."
"Chinese automaker SAIC announces India entry, will start making cars in 2019","SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced plans to enter India and start manufacturing cars by 2019, becoming the first Chinese automaker to venture in what will be the world’s third biggest auto market by 2020.

SAIC, formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start making cars at its fully-owned manufacturing facility by 2019. SAIC is still negotiating to take over the General Motors’ Halol factory which closed operations on April 28 this year.

In India, SAIC has already registered its local subsidiary, MG Motors India. The company has roped in former GM India executives to lead its India operations -- Rajeev Chhaba will be president and managing director while P Balendran will be the executive director.

The largest automobile company in China stands 46th in the Fortune Global 500 list, with annual revenue of over $100 billion. The state-owned automaker has joint ventures in China with Detroit-headquartered GM and Germany’s Volkswagen, with brands such as MG, Roewe and Maxus under its belt.

Outside China, SAIC is present in several global markets including UK, USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Middle East, South East Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. It even has an ‘Overseas Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley, California.

What models will SAIC bring to India under the MG badge remains a mystery. Founded in 1924, the Morris Garage has seen several change of hands before China’s Nanjing Automobile Group acquired it in 2005. It came under the SAIC umbrella after SAIC merged with Nanjing in 2008.

“The introduction of the iconic British Sports Car Brand ‘MG’ in India is an important part of SAIC Motor’s global strategy. Our aim is to provide best-in-class vehicles, integrating sophisticated British design and quality, breakthrough product features and a pleasing ownership experience,” the company said in a statement.

“As a new-age auto company focused on innovation and technology, the company offers various solutions and technological capabilities required in the development of ‘new energy vehicles’, to cater to the changing needs of global customers and the overall ecosystem,” the statement added."

"All Bihar districts to be free from open defecation by 2019, says CM Nitish Kumar","The Bihar government has set a deadline of March, 2019 to make the districts free from open defecation.

The government has also set a target of making 4,555 gram panchayats open-defecation free by the end of the current financial year 2017-18.

During the review meeting of Lohia Swachh Bihar Abhiyan, chief minister Nitish Kumar asked officials to speed up the process of achieving the target.

Nitish held a high-level meeting on Saturday evening to review the progress of work of rural development department and Panchayati Raj department.

While reviewing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), Kumar said the water conservation project, which was implemented in Nalanda district, should be considered a “role-model” and it should be implemented in all the districts of the state especially in south Bihar.

He also asked officials to take up the matter of afforestation in order to increase the forest coverage area in the state.

During the review of Jeevika, the CM stressed upon the need to speed up the process of creation of 10 lakh Self Help Gropus (SHGs) in the state by the end of December 2018, the release said."
‘Sir’ Ravindra Jadeja’s poetic reply to International Cricket Council’s 1-Test ban,"Ravindra Jadeja, who has been handed a one-Test ban after accumulating six demerit points in a 24-month period post the conclusion of the second India vs Sri Lanka Test, on Monday threw the cricket fraternity in a tizzy with a sarcastic tweet.

On Sunday, Jadeja was adjudged Man-of-the-Match for taking seven wickets in the second Test at Colombo, including five in the second innings, and scoring a vital 70 not out off a mere 85 balls which included four fours and three sixes as India completed a comprehensive win over Sri Lanka by an innings and 53 runs to seal the series.

However, Jadeja, who has been at the forefront of India’s domination in Test cricket since the last two years or so, was handed a suspension which will prevent him from playing in the third Test at Kandy where India will be fancying a 3-0 clean sweep.

READ | Ravindra Jadeja’s Man-of-Match moment turns bitter: Why he will miss a Test

The world No.1 bowler in Test cricket admitted his guilt in throwing the ball at Sri Lanka’s Malinda Pushpakumara after fielding it off his own bowling, but took to Twitter a day later to perhaps highlight what he believes was ironical.

The 28-year-old all-rounder, who enjoys fencing his bat upon bringing up half-centuries, chose a dramatic line from a Bollywood movie starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol.

“Hum sharif kya hue puri duniya hi badmash ho gayi,” his post read, which means: “The entire world has gone notorious when I decided to turn good”.

Jadeja was already carrying three demerit points after running on the pitch during the Indore Test against New Zealand last year.

This is not the first time Jadeja has found himself caught in a controversy.

Ro-ros to row cars across sea along Mumbai’s west coast by 2019,"In the next two years, a ferry service across the sea will make travelling along Mumbai's west coast a lot quicker.

The Ro-Ro (roll-on roll-off ) water transport service at four spots — Marve to Manori, Borivli to Gorai, Bhayander to Vasai and Virar to Palghar — that will let you ferry your cars over the sea is expected to cut down travel time from up to two hours hour to less than 10 minutes (see box).

A Rs90-crore Ro-Ro plan, proposed by the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), got a green nod last week from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).

“After the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) gave us the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances for the entire project in July, we studied the environment impact and found the four projects will reduce travel time and vehicular pollution,” said a senior official from SEIAA.

“While work on three of the four routes can start, minor aspects on the Borivli-Gorai route are yet to be studied,” the official said.

The Ro-Ros will expand Mumbai’s water transport system substantially, said experts. This is the first such project proposed for the west coast. It can transport 50 passengers and 10 cars on either side, officials said. So far, citizens could only ferry two-wheelers between Versova and Madh and Manori and Marwe.

“This project will be a new chapter in the water transport story of Maharashtra,” said Atul Patne, the chief executive officer of the MMB. Patne said the ferry service will not only help citizens save money, but also bring down congestion on roads and cut pollution.

“There are three main aspects of the project – reduction in traffic congestion, drop in pollution and reduction in time taken to travel these distances. From distances that were two hours apart, now the time taken will be a maximum of 10-12 minutes,” Patne said.

The Marve-Manori project is expected to be ready by mid-2018, while the other will be completed by early 2019, Patne said. According to the MMB, at least two crore people in Maharashtra use Ro-Ros but only a handful of routes provide the facility to ferry two-wheelers.

The SEIAA has also approved a proposal to revamp all eight jetties. MMB officials said the work has begun.

“We will be issuing tenders this week for the project and will hire contractors to ferry medium-sized boats that can carry the estimated capacity of cars and people,” said an MMB official, in-charge of the project. “While the cost for each four-wheeler is still being worked out, we estimate the fare for two-wheelers and SUVs to be between Rs250 – Rs400.”

Last year, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told the state assembly that Ro-Ro services would link south Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Alibaug and services would start by end of 2018.

MMB officials said work for the Rs150-crore Ro-Ro services between Ferry Wharf (Bhaucha Dhakka) and Mandwa in Raigad district along Mumbai’s east coast, is 50% done. “While the work is being jointly carried out with the Mumbai Port Trust, the jetty at Mandwa has been revamped and the project should be completed by May 2018,” the MMB official said."

08:20 hrs IST: Hello and welcome to HT’s live coverage of Day 3 of the second Test between India - Sri Lanka at Colombo.

Earlier, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane had both scored centuries, before fifties from Ravichandran Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha and Ravindra Jadeja helped India cross the 600-run mark.

On Day 3, India will look to grab some quick wickets and end the hosts’ first innings, having already carried a lead of 572 runs from Day 2. It will be interesting to see if skipper Virat Kohli decides to enforce follow-on in case Sri Lanka fail to reach the score of 423.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will look to take their time at the crease and add some runs to the board as they seek to avoid a second straight loss in the series."
